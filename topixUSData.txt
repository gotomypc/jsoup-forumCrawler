What Divides Catholics and Protestants?&&&What are the main protests of the protestants against the catholic? Are the protests really the big issues in believing/following/obeying Jesus? What types of spirits that brings human to be divided in the worship of Jesus? The Holy Spirit of Jesus will not/never do that. It will never protest for the sake of Jesus and the glory of God the Father. The Holy Spirit is only urging mankind to love God and thy neighbors only; therefore, there should be no killing/murdering/much protests/complaining for the sake of Jesus. The xtians are even not allowed to kill any humans of different faiths/beliefs. Jesus's love is not limited to any groups of humans on earth/universe. Jesus must be made known to the whole world that He is God who brings salvation to all mankind. There is no guarantee of salvation if one denies Jesus; those who never heard of Jesus are exception; God will handle their case accordingly.&&&83720

A Hot Topic: Climate Change Coming To Classrooms&&&Well it's about time! Students need to be told of all the horrors to come so that they.. er.. well, anyway, what they really need are guiding principles, so here you go: The Ten Commandments According to the Al Gore (In truth, there are 11, but that�s Al for you) 1. I am the Al your Gore, creator of the internet; you shall not listen to climate scientists who do not agree with me, for these use data that is unclean and may contain references that fail to fit my master plan. 2. You shall not take the name of the Al, thy Gore in vain. 3. Pay no attention to the emails behind the curtain, for Global Warming is real, and trust me on this � I am completely objective even though Global Warming has made me filthy rich. 4. Remember to keep holy the Earth day: Drive only a Compact Hybrid, and know that I will be watching you from heaven (in my private jet). 5. Honor your father Al and your mother Tipper - You owe us Big Time, for without the Al Gore and his Tipper, the Earth would slip er.. 6. You shall not kill - any climate change bills for these are the manna from heaven that sustains the Al Gore and makes Tipper go flipper. 7. You shall not commit adultery, or more importantly, screw me out of carbon credits � I invented the idea, so these belong to the Al Gore alone; But, if you must, go forth and create your own scam. 8. You shall not steal � That is my job. 9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor, unless he disagrees with human caused global warming, in which case feel free to trash his character. 10. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife because she may have voted for the Al Gore. If not � Covet away! 11. You shall not covet you neighbor's goods, because these will be exchanged for carbon credits (See Commandment #7) � and when the tablets were completed, the Al Gore looked down upon the millions, dreamed of untold billions, and thought the scam was good. Subtext: Teach kids about the abject hypocrisy rampant in the "true believer" espousers of AGM.&&&398

Mr. Brezinski was President Jimmy Carter's National Security Adviser and has written some great books himself, "Second Chance" which outlines the diplomacy and security issues of Bush 41, Clinton and Bush 43, among other great reads.

Ironically, a true conservative � General Colin Powell came out against right-wing hate and bigotry and was attacked by the very people that Ben Carlson is snuggling up under. Furthermore, it is funny how the majority of Blacks support the Democratic Party � who elected and African American as their Presidential nominee (who made history by being elected President) and they rejected republican racism� the very racism that Uncle Tom�s like Herman Cain and Ben Carlson wallows around in as they ignore it and claims it to be on the other side.

Maybe supervolcano didn't nearly kill us all&&&Nice evidence. The main point about this eruption is that it occurred in a glacial period (the last one); which initiated about 110,000 Bp, well before the eruption of the YTT. The glacial periods involve 2 climate modes. Climate mode#1 results in a double tropical rainbelt either side of an equatorial savannah from downwelling. This is then followed N. & S. of the jungle zone by classical desert and then by temperate rainbelt at about the latitude of the N. Sahara (it is a glacial period) then by (further N. & S. a polar high pressure hood with strong katabatic airflow into the temperate rainbelt. This is NOT a very efficient mode with the result that the equator heats rapidly and the poles refrigerate. Climate mode#4 is composed of 3 cells per hemisphere running in a fixed geographic location with a conveyor belt of warm inflow low pressure cells in the SE sector, lots of rain in the E. lots of snow in the NE. cold return flow in the NW. slightly warmer inflow to the W. and warmer inflow SW.(all highly evaporative over land and carrying snow showers & squalls over the sea. The centre of each mode#4 cell is a high pressure cell the size of Australia. This is a VERY efficient mode and is responsible for the glacial period, able during operation tapping the El Nino hot pool of dropping global temperatures by ~7 deg c from the interglacial norm and depositing a large ice cap on the Laurentide shield. Geometry & fixed locations mean that few other ice caps except Antarctica & Patagonia develop in mode#4. The net effect of the operation of the mode is that equatorial oceanic heat is redistributed to the pole which remains relatively warm except in the NW, sector where the return flow occurs. During the glacial period after initiation climate mode#4 does not run for very long (a few centuries) and will shut down when the excess equatorial heat is removed from the ocean. Following the shutdown of climate mode#4 the cold default climate mode#1 breaks out which cause the ice caps deposited under mode#4 to refrigerate and ablate VERY slowly, while the equatorial regions warm rapidly. Toba YTT would have caused a major dust veil index. The cooling would have resulted in an outbreak of climate mode#4 which would have drained the oceanic equatorial heat pool & dumped most of the dust veil & H2So4 aerosol onto the icecaps in a long term snowstorm during the chaos typical of the storms in the inswing sector of mode#4 running from equator to pole (reaching from ground to stratosphere). The result of the Toba YTT was a doubling of the size of the laurentide icecap so there was a LOT of heat exchange and a hell of a lot of snow. The chaos of course would have removed the dust veil very quickly so the shutdown of mode#4 would have been typical of global temperatures in prior shutdowns (equator maybe 1 to 5 degrees c cooler than usual during mode#4 shutdowns, and equatorial ocean somewhat cooler still than the average). Expect therefore the average day temperature to be around 18 to 20 degrees c rather than 25 to 27 degrees c and a lot of retained heat in the jungle high humidity zones. Following the shutdown of climate mode#4 the climate mode reverts to climate mode#1 (cold default) at which point the equator heats rapidly topping out at 28 to 35 deg c which is the likely land temperature when the next mode#4 event triggers. No doubt the jungle/savannah transition @ lake malawi would have survived without frost burns. It is also likely therefore that the Indian aboriginees would have survived (if they had a food source under all that ash). The big hit would strike in the area of the Temperate rainbelt & N. which would have refrigerated strongly after the climate mode#4 snowdump ended. Many of the frozen carcasses in the NW. extremities of the mammoth steppes of mode#4 would be likely to remain solid for millennia. Have a nice day: Ag&&&1

Lawmakers criticize handling of Boston bombing&&&And then we have the Gov. of Massachusetts, Devel Patrick, withholding evidence in this investigation. Clear, he should be charge with being an "accessory after the fact"!!! By Emily Smith, Thu, April 25, 2013 Massachusetts Governor Devel Patrick has REFUSED to release confidential information about what sort of financial aid, welfare, and unemployment the Tsarnaev brothers were getting, arguing that it is not within the law to do so, despite his own curiosity. Patrick said protecting terrorists' private rights was irrelevant. The Boston Herald reported on Tuesday that the family received taxpayer funded welfare during brief periods in the brothers� childhood and during Tamerlan Tsarnaev�s marriage, which was later confirmed by state spokesperson Alec Loftus. It is unclear what kind of aid and how much they received. The Department of Transitional Assistance is currently gathering information to assure that the dispersion of state welfare was lawful. Spokesperson Robert Connolly also dismissed questions of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev�s aid at UMass Dartmouth:�It is our position � and I believe the accepted position in higher education � that student records including academic records and financial records (including financial aid) cannot under federal law be released without a student�s consent,� Connolly said. The taxpayer funding continues, though, as Dzokhar�s medical bills and lawyers are both covered by the state. ========== We need some answers NOW; get a private prosecutor on the case before it is too late to stop the next attack..&&&52

Lawmakers criticize handling of Boston bombing&&&And then we have the Gov. of Massachusetts, Devel Patrick, withholding evidence in this investigation. Clear, he should be charge with being an "accessory after the fact"!!! By Emily Smith, Thu, April 25, 2013 Massachusetts Governor Devel Patrick has REFUSED to release confidential information about what sort of financial aid, welfare, and unemployment the Tsarnaev brothers were getting, arguing that it is not within the law to do so, despite his own curiosity. Patrick said protecting terrorists' private rights was irrelevant. The Boston Herald reported on Tuesday that the family received taxpayer funded welfare during brief periods in the brothers� childhood and during Tamerlan Tsarnaev�s marriage, which was later confirmed by state spokesperson Alec Loftus.

Republican Civil War updates&&&Liberal troops need to use this space to post ongoing Republican attacks, including propaganda. The Republican Civil War, which was declared in 1981, has been a very one-sided, never-ending series of battles because most liberal troops have put the responsibility for self defense on the shoulders of legislators. In fact, most liberals have completely ignored the war. This writer was shocked at the absence of outrage when Reagan created the homeless crisis, especially from Protestant leaders and followers. Recently Romney lied about how large his income has been, even though Republican voters consistently favor more money going to the wealthy. So, the question is, did Romney admit that taking money from the middle class and giving it to the wealthy is wrong? Is he just a career liar and lied without giving it a second thought? Republicans have been so successful for so many decades because they excel at spreading propaganda. They've managed to get tens of millions of middle class taxpayers, who conplain constantly about having to pay so much in taxes, to vote to pay more so the wealthy can get richer. (next post)&&&246

We now have our own American Ancien Regime and it's time to take it down.

But, I fear there will be blood.&&&1096

Of course, Dems would blame harder since the mirror reflection upon them is not strong in reality. One thing the new administration should do is drop the "war on terror" terminology. That just incites a erroneous methodology for military solution. What is required in international cooperation and diplomacy. I ho0pe an internationl anti terrorist police force of some kind will be formed. Thank god, only two more years of this moron.&&&273283

Obama and AG Holder considered America to belong to the world Mozlem brothers and to the socialist liberals but not to the American people based on Holder recent speech that called illegal invaders and overstaying visa students and tourists of the world to come and own America as their basic human right based on the liberal Democrat agenda that aimed at destroying the GOP and create new world order under the UN.

Jakarta Capital Environmental Blog: Crown Eco Management | Wattpad&&&Sea disputes, N. Korea in spotlight at ASEAN summit Concerned about possible escalation of long-seething tensions over certain isles in South China Sea, Southeast Asian officials meeting in Brunei this week are planning to press China to agree to begin talks to draft a new pact aimed at preventing a major military confrontation in one of the busiest waterways in the globe. Apprehension over North Korea�s recent saber-rattling is also expected to compete for attention over vital economic issues in the annual ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit being held Wednesday and Thursday in Bandar Seri Begawan, capital of Brunei. The 10-nation ASEAN bloc is under time-pressure to try to develop the significantly culture-differentiated region of 600 million people after the European Union model-community before 2016. First conceptualized in a 2007 master plan, the work to transform the dynamic region into a singular market-and-production hub has reached about 77 percent completion, according to a draft declaration to be released after the summit. No details as to what remains undone have been given. A copy of the joint statement obtained by The Associated Press on Monday states the ASEAN leaders� continuing commitment to ensure the peaceful resolution of South China Sea conflicts within the bounds of international law and �without resorting to the threat or use of force.� ASEAN stands to call for �the early adoption of a code of conduct in the South China Sea,� referring to a legally-binding agreement it would like to forge with China to replace a 2002 nonaggression accord that has failed to stop territorial conflicts. China, Taiwan and ASEAN members Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines have overlapping territorial claims across the South China Sea, which Beijing claims in its entirety. Vietnam and the Philippines, for instance, have been constantly playing cat-and-mouse with China over the region in recent years, with diplomatic squabbles exploding over gas and oil exploration and fishing rights. A tense standoff last year between Chinese and Filipino naval ships over the resource-rich Scarborough Shoal has remained unsettled. The Philippine vessels withdrew; but China has adamantly declined from pulling out its three surveillance ships and removing a rope stopping Filipino fishermen from venturing into a Scarborough lagoon. The Philippines, early this year, protested against China�s extensive territorial claims before an arbitration tribunal of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in a bold legal action that China has all but ignored. The tribunal is still hoping to appoint three more of five arbiters by Thursday, then begin investigating the complaint whether it has jurisdiction. A pre-summit conference of ASEAN foreign ministers in Brunei two weeks ago generally revolved around concerns over the territorial disputes and concluded with a demand for an early completion of a nonaggression pact with China, Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario stated. Chinese officials, however, have not specifically signified when they would decide to meet for discussions on the proposed accord. ASEAN unity has been endangered by the territorial issue. Cambodia, an all of China, rejected moves to have the issue inserted in a post-ministerial statement during last year�s summit. Vietnam and the Philippines protested the snub and the ASEAN summit concluded without issuing an after-conference communique, a first in the bloc�s 45-year existence. China has vigorously refused to bring the issues to the international forum, opting to deal with each of its rivals on a one-on-one basis. It has also warned U.S. not to intervene in the regional disputes. Original article: Read more at the related article:&&&1

The warmongering NeoCons have divorced themselves so far from the original tenents of the Republican party of peace, smaller government, and personal liberty that they present as Fascists. The longer Paul stays in the campaign, the more people awaken, and it will ultimately result in a win for a Democrat, likely Hillary, who will begin to lead this country back to greatness. The NeoCons, knowing they are no longer valid, won't run in the next presidential race, and the next Republican candidates will be true Conservatives who represent the party's original integrity.&&&28693

Local VA Councilwoman Interrupts Class Presentation of Community...&&&To Councilwoman Sharon Brooks-Hodge: I can't believe what you said and did to that class that was giving the city council a quilt that they had worked very hard on. To throw such a fit about a black stick figure that had nothing to do with the color of one's skin. Black is the absence of light in the color world. That makes black the perfect color to show absences of knowledge in a piece of art. It depicted a person in the dark-of which you have shown yourself to be. There was nothing racist intended. I'm sure there were all colors of skin in the class. You are a racist for looking for something racist. Without racism, the NAACP and race baiters would be unemployed. As for the general black public, without racism, they would be stuck just being equal everyday Americans. We can't have that! When do we stop paying this 200 year old debt that we had nothing to do with. I was born in Georgia but none of my ancestors owned or bought slaves. YOU were not a slave. Get over it! The students displayed a greater maturity than you, apparently, are capable of achieving. Not only should you be ashamed of your behavior but you should consider resigning due to your hyper sensitive thin skin; after apologizing to the school children.&&&11

Stay Out of Syria! Part II&&&Across Syria, rebel-held areas are dotted with Islamic courts staffed by lawyers and clerics, and by fighting brigades led by extremists.

So, these folks have come out of the closet and there is no stopping them now. I personally wish they would all go back in the closet but it is a powerful voting block that will not be denied. So, it is best to allow these people the right to some type of civil union so that they will be able to obtain insurance and other rights afforded to married couples.&&&3

Despite calls to slow down, NRC grants Vermont Yankee license renewal&&&For anyone who had lingering questions about the NRC being a shameless, incompetent, arrogant, rich boys club, bent on amassing huge fortunes for themselves and their friends in the nuclear industry, where those who are supposed to be regulating, profit from the industry and vise versa, repeatedly sacrificing safety for profit, ignoring "lessons learned", common sense, the warnings of the scientific community and now, even a sence of human decency, here is your answer. They could not even take an extra week to learn from Japan's horrible tragedy, in nuclear plants of very similar design. This action is an affront to the Japanese people, the American way and indeed everyone who thought that it was the NRC's job to look out for their safety in nuclear matters.&&&314

Sharia Law: Oklahoma Says No. Again&&&I don't even know why this should be under discussion in Oklahoma, OR any other state in the union. If Muslims want to be under Sharia Law, let them move to an Islamic country. But first, I'd advise them to make sure they can adhere to all it's religious doctrines, as well as the penalties, if they don't. "I have a news flash for the people at CAIR and others opposing this bill. This is the United States; not some other country. Our laws should reign supreme and not be tossed aside if a judge wants to apply a foreign law that was not passed or signed by any elected American. It's important to note that the bill only prevents the application of a foreign law when doing so would violate either the state or U.S. constitution."&&&25
Former Rep Patrick Kennedy leads campaign against legal pot&&&Here follows an extract from "Notes on Democracy" by Henry Louis Mencken, written in 1926, during alcohol prohibition (1919-1933): The Prohibitionists, when they foisted their brummagem cure-all upon the country under cover of the war hysteria, gave out that their advocacy of it was based upon a Christian yearning to abate drunkenness, and so abolish crime, poverty and disease. They preached a [crime, poverty and disease free] millennium, and no doubt convinced hundreds of thousands of naive and sentimental persons, not themselves Puritans, nor even democrats. That millennium, as everyone knows, has failed to come in. Not only are crime, poverty and disease undiminished, but drunkenness itself, if the police statistics are to be believed, has greatly increased. The land rocks with the scandal. Prohibition has made the use of alcohol devilish and even fashionable, and so vastly augmented the number of users. The young of both sexes, mainly innocent of the cup under license, now take to it almost unanimously. In brief, Prohibition has not only failed to work the benefits that its proponents promised in 1917; it has brought in so many new evils that even the mob has turned against it. But do the Prohibitionists admit the fact frankly, and repudiate their original nonsense? They do not. On the contrary, they keep on demanding more and worse enforcement statutes � that is to say, more and worse devices for harassing and persecuting their opponents. The more obvious the failure becomes, the more shamelessly they exhibit their genuine motives. In plain words, what moves them is the psychological aberration called sadism. They lust to inflict inconvenience, discomfort, and, whenever possible, disgrace upon the persons they hate � which is to say, upon everyone who is free from their barbarous theological superstitions, and is having a better time in the world than they are. They cannot stop the use of alcohol, nor even appreciably diminish it, but they can badger and annoy everyone who seeks to use it decently, and they can fill the jails with men taken for purely artificial offences, and they can get satisfaction thereby for the Puritan yearning to browbeat and injure, to torture and terrorize, to punish and humiliate all who show any sign of being happy. And all this they can do with a safe line of policemen and judges in front of them; always they can do it without personal risk.&&&6

They usually just pick back up where they left off with their habit when they are released, but now with a felony conviction and no job. More of a formula for despair and drug use.&&&1419

Pit Bull Ban&&&Citizens of America, While I am aware there are bigger problems our country face, I would like to take a minute to discuss an issue that my community (Bluefield,WV) has taken to heart. Recently there was a pit bull ban in my small town. This may not seem like a big deal to most, however, the negative mentality that has been placed on this breed of K9 has recently caused a dreadful situation to occur. On the news today, it was said that an individual murdered 13 pit bull puppies. Unfortunately, the individual responsible for this horrific undertaking has not been found. I ask that you all share this message with everyone you know as a way to inform our country of what this community has come to. I am also hoping that by sharing this, the pit bull ban will be lifted as well as the one who committed the crime being found and brought to justice.

Unlike every other electrical motor, generator or turbines which have the orientation of the rotor and stator magnets symmetrical around the centreline, causing electromechanical friction, and stalling as the magnets reach a state of equilibrium. The Pole-R-Power rotor is comprised of a staggered magnetic array, with the perpendicular faces of the repelling magnets oriented to be at maximum repulsion either above or below the centreline to induce rotation with a minimum or electromagnetic flux. When examined under a magnetic field viewer, the differences between the Pole-R-Power rotor and that of a conventional rotor are clearly evident. The flux field around the magnets in a conventional rotor is very uniform, equal in size in all directions. The staggered magnetic array rotor has an area of intensified magnetic flux at the transition point of the two distinct magnetic fields. This phenomenon has been documented regularly and universally dismissed as an anomaly with no practical way to benefit from this area of intensified magnetic energy, or �hot spot�. DSHI will commercialize the world�s first magnetic generator, a patent pending technology that potentially changes the way electrical generators are designed and manufactured. DSHI have a range of patent pending technologies under licence development, ensuring a consistent flow of products to support its mandate as a global leading innovator of renewable and clean energy solutions.&&&1

Okla. Muslims fret about anti-Islamic rhetoric&&&Did Karen and "Ray Janbaz of Oklahoma City post this thread? Are you worried the residents of Oklahoma City and the State of Oklahoma are going to realize they have a anti-American establishment doing business in our fair capitol? OKC was hit by one terrorist group with Timothy McVeigh/Terry Nichols, we don't want to learn that lesson again. We know that Ray Janbaz is an Iranian, we know that he met with a group of other Iranian men on "business" and also took a trip to California with these same men. He travels back to Iran periodically. All of those facts were posted by his progressive liberal wife Karen. Karen has also posted about her support of a nuclear Iran and her anti-American views on Topix. She post sometimes under her real username "justaminute" but she will use other people usernames in a nano-second to post gibberish and obscene jokes. We know she uses more than one computer to accomplish her game playing on Topix.&&&7

Obama backs Planned Parenthood in political fight&&&Here goes Obama up to his usual antics when he gets in trouble. His divisiveness and anti-American rhetoric lead to Boston. His inability to regulate out of control businesses that wreak havic on the environment lead to West, TX. His ineptitude in foreign policy lead to Bengazhi. He has blood on his hands. So what does he do? He joins with Planned Parenthood to scare women, again pitting Americans against each other for political gain since he cannot score points through merit. Obama needs to resign. He is obviously not qualified nor mature enough for the job. He already caused so much death and destruction. He must be removed from office before his tyranny leads to any more deaths.&&&41

Congressional immigration debate signals big shift&&&While Obama and Janet Napolitano keep claiming that the border is �closed�, millions of illegal invaders are crossing the border and overstaying their visas only to become Obama's sold-out voters for new anti-American revolution in America. In fact, when liberal Elite Schumer who follows blindly the Obama's agenda of winning the votes of as many illegal invaders as possible for GOP defeat in 2014 elections is more than happy about his 800 pages of new Amnesty 'reform', it is time for the GOP to worry or otherwise to stop being the second party in America. The shameful 'bending over' of John McCain and Lindsey Graham to every liberal effort to give Amnesty while bringing more than 40 million new voters to the Democratic Party by giving the relatives of the invaders free food stamps and Obama phone in return for their vote for Obama' could bring to the destruction of the GOP as a party of spineless losers who lost their way of the American constitution. No GOP Congressman should vote for the destruction of the GOP as a party by allowing Obama bringing to America new bloc of parasitic voters that will not work and their vote will be paid for through free Obama check.&&&116

Gun Control Advocates Revel in Obama's Economic War on Guns&&&Then obama is guilty of treason. "...Baldwin J charged the jury...." "The first section of the bill of rights in the constitution of Pennsylvania declares that all men have the inherent and indefeasible right of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property that no man can be deprived of his liberty or property but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land Sect 9 That the right of citizens to bear arms in defence of themselves and the state shall not be questioned Sect 21 The second section of the fourth article of the constitution of the United States declares the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. The tenth section of the first article prohibits any state from passing any law which impairs the obligation of a contract. The second amendment provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." "...We shall pursue this subject no further, in its bearing on the political rights of the states composing the union--in recalling your attention to these rights, which are the subject of this controversy, we declare to you as the law of the case, that they are inherent and unalienable--so recognised by all our fundamental laws. "The constitution of the state or union is not the source of these rights, or the others to which we have referred you, they existed in their plenitude before any constitutions, which do not create but protect and secure them against any violation by the legislatures or courts, in making, expounding or administering laws. "The nature of this case, its history, and the course of the argument, call on us to declare explicitly what is the effect of a constitutional protection or guarantee of any right, or the injunction of any duty. The twenty sixth section of the bill of rights in the constitution of Pennsylvania, is in these words; "to guard against transgressions of the high powers we have delegated we declare [we the people of Pennsylvania], that every thing in this article is excepted out of the general powers of government, and shall for ever remain inviolate." A higher power declares this constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme laws of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding" Const U.S., art. 6, clause 2. "An amendment of the constitution is of still higher authority, for it has the effect of controlling and repealing the express provisions of the constitution authorizing a power to be exercised, by a declaration that it shall not be construed to give such power. 3 Dall 382. "We have stated to you the various provisions of the constitution of the United States and its amendments, as well as that of this state; you see their authority and obligation to be supreme over any laws or regulations which are repugnant to them, or which violate, infringe or impair any right thereby secured; the conclusions which result are too obvious to be more than stated." - U.S. Supreme Court Justice BALDWIN, Circuit Court of The United States,[PENNSYLVANIA APRIL TERM 1833 BEFORE Hon.

If the msnbc crowd can't talk about what a great job their idol is doing their personal views get less credibility as does their job security.

ONGOING CRIMES IN TEXAS - DALLAS-FORT WORTH AREA - ARLINGTON&&&I am working every day to protect myself from any aggression or brutality continued here in the United States, and in Texas, in particular. This is not my home, to begin with, only El Paso was in my childhood only. There are no shelters in Arlington other than one which has a criminal history in my life, the Arlington Life Shelter, I believe, through trance crimes against me in the name many ahve used to lie about me and commit slavery crimes, calling me "Fatima" or variations of it, such as here, "Fatima the Jew" or "Black Fatima". "Slave Pat" is another p...opular United States crime designation, with "Trance Victim" being used to enslave me in public meetings and on the street. If you hav any ideas or resources, please let me know. I am speaking about who I really am more in public to protect myself, and make it clear that it is no "accident" that so many people focus on me every day for their own criminal reasons. I may have to sleep in a field, and I am not kidding. The slavery crimes and murder attempts have never ended in the United States against me, and many countless people are involved in a big gang-attitude toward me since it is such a famous crime, with an attitude that no one will ever stop them past the brutal murder attempts against me in the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. that no one did anything about. People know that they have state permission to try to commit slavery crimes here, adnt here m ay still be bounty fees attached once utilized also as a type of finder's percentages for slavery.

Ben Lujan memorial: Hundreds Pay Respect to 'Prince Among Men'&&&As a human being May He Rest In Peace. As a politician he was the poster child for Term Limits. Like every other politician he started off with the right intentions of helping people. But, after a while his intentions turned to financial gains and making his unqualified son Ben Ray a U.S. Representative. What would that kid be doing now had he not won, dealing cards or being another worthless exempt in State Government, probably. Everyone acts like he was so nice, even last night on T.V. His sister in law calls him an Icon. Give me a break, he was far from that. He was the guy that pushed Bill Richardson's crooked agenda and made sure that his rail runner and spaceport, which have been financial boondoggles for New Mexico taxpayers, passed the legislature in return for Fat Bill's support of Ben Gay for PRC and Congress. The focus should have been on job creation and education instead of worrying about getting his name put on everything. The Saint was also embroiled in an illegal billboard scandal, a controversial interchange being moved from where it was needed in La Puebla to an area in Arroyo Seco by property he owned, the illegal paving scandal at the Nambe Church, which is now going to be called the Ben Lujan Church, just kidding, I hope. Yep, he was an icon if you were a crooked friend or his family. I for one will not miss him.&&&6

The next in importance is the right of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of his conscience. The third, the right of seeking and pursuing his safety and happiness. The fourth, the right of communicating his thought and his opinions. Fifth, the right to acquire and protect property. Sixth, the right to meet and consult with his fellows as to what will promote the common welfare. Seventh--and while enjoying all these rights, these six that I have just mentioned, he has the right to bear arms in defense of himself, his family and his state, and no man can take it away. There are seven inalienable and inherent rights of the individual man."--Mr. C.T. Allen, Oct. 9, 1890.[Official Report of the Proceedings and Debates in the Convention, Kentucky]&&&4

Also I have added a few IP cameras so you anyone can check up on the farm. There is one on our 75ft grain leg giving an overview of the farm, a cow cam to watch our cows, pit cam to see if we are hauling corn, and a dryer cam to make sure the dryer is up and running. Feel free to check all this out and more at our farm website here&&&1

Alleged chemical arms use in Syria appears to fit pattern of gradual introduction of weapons&&&From Al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood or Assad???

It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years..." David Rockefeller [June, 1991] continuing "...

Wyoming gov.: Don't examine global effects of coal&&&It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism Acrimony and hyperpartisanship have seeped into every part of the political process. Congress is deadlocked and its approval ratings are at record lows. America�s two main political parties have given up their traditions of compromise, endangering our very system of constitutional democracy. And one of these parties has taken on the role of insurgent outlier; the Republicans have become ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise, and ardently opposed to the established social and economic policy regime. In It�s Even Worse Than It Looks, congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein identify two overriding problems that have led Congress�and the United States�to the brink of institutional collapse. The first is the serious mismatch between our political parties, which have become as vehemently adversarial as parliamentary parties, and a governing system that, unlike a parliamentary democracy, makes it extremely difficult for majorities to act. Second, while both parties participate in tribal warfare, both sides are not equally culpable. The political system faces what the authors call �asymmetric polarization,� with the Republican Party implacably refusing to allow anything that might help the Democrats politically, no matter the cost. With dysfunction rooted in long-term political trends, a coarsened political culture and a new partisan media, the authors conclude that there is no �silver bullet� reform that can solve everything. But they offer a panoply of useful ideas and reforms, endorsing some solutions, like greater public participation and institutional restructuring of the House and Senate, while debunking others, like independent or third-party candidates. Above all, they call on the media as well as the public at large to focus on the true causes of dysfunction rather than just throwing the bums out every election cycle. Until voters learn to act strategically to reward problem solving and punish obstruction, American democracy will remain in serious danger.[amazon.com]&&&2

Now these fiscal cliff reality has made poor to middle class poorer.is this fair.?

Wei Liu: My Life in China 1.2: My Kindergarten in China&&&Wei Liu: My Life in China 1.2: My Kindergarten in China Wei Liu April 2013 I�m sent to a kindergarten when I�m three, but actually I don�t want to go there. There are no real games for us children to play. The teachers there most times are telling or showing us the so-called revolutionary stories, which are about how the Chinese Communist Party grabbed the state power. I don�t like it, not only because it is killing, but also because our life is miserable. If the so-called revolution made us common people live so poorly and constantly starve, what�s the significance of revolution? Is that real revolution? That year is 1973. That kindergarten is within the periphery of the hospital in Chongqing, China, where my father works. It is in fact the first floor of the building next to our dormitory building. I still remember in some grayish chilly days, around 5 o�clock in the afternoon when the sky turns to dim, a large group of adults stand at the gate of the kindergarten to pick up their respective child and my peers run to them. Those adults hold their children in front of their chest.�Mom��&#65292;�Lin�L in��&#65292;�Dad��&#65 292;�Shan�Shan��&#65292;th ese joyful sounds come to my ear incessantly. Having not seen my mom or dad appear, I cannot share their joy. Where are they? Have they forgotten me? I go on watching the joyful gathering, filled up with more anxiety. 5 o�clock in the afternoon is the time for the parents to pick up their children, and the teachers in the kindergarten also feel their responsibility for the children ends then. No one comes to take care of me. I keep standing there smart or silly, waiting desperately for the appearance of my mom or my dad�s figure. The sky is already grayish, turning dark and still no sign of my parent�s appearance. The buildings, the ground and the wall of the kindergarten all look very dim now, the same with the sky. The joyful gatherings of the parents and their children have passed for long. Even the teachers are gone. Maybe one teacher is still here, with no sign to take care of me. I�m frightened. If my mom or dad does not come to pick me up at all today, what can I do? How can I spend tonight? But I can only stand there idle. No one comes to give me a stool to sit down. I�m 3 or 4 years old. My mom or dad still hasn�t come and I have been in despair. The surroundings get darker and darker and my scope gets dimmer and dimmer. The buildings around, the ground and the wall of the kindergarten look blur to me. It must be half past six in the afternoon now. Except waiting there idle, there is nothing for me to do, and that seems to last forever. I don�t know how, a young lady leads me out of the kindergarten and back to my home. �Old Wei Wei, your dad gets involved in the Cultural Revolution in the hospital,� she says. She does not tell me more of it. I guess she�s a teacher or staff in the kindergarten. From the broadcasting, I know the Culture Revolution is to inflict the enemy of the Communist Party. I don�t know whether dad is being inflicted by other people or he is inflicting other people. People around me all call me �Old Wei,��Old Wei Liu�, and those who like me call me �Old Wei Wei�. I don�t know why people around me like to call me Old, who is just several years old. I�m willing to be called Old, which shows that I should know something. Actually, my mother or father gave me another Chinese character of Wei for my name, which I don�t like for its too strong meaning of fighting. Later I change to another Chinese character of Wei, meaning light blue, giving out a peaceful feeling. The rest see the reply. **********&&&5

ALL I know is if this 800 plus pages in this insane draft called the 2013 Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, the American people will suffer even worse, then the earlier Amnesty of 1986. The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) sold us down the road. It was a complete mockery and we are supposed to believe this new Illegal Immigration reform is any different. READ THE PIECE OF GARBAGE! BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY EXEMPTIONS AND WAIVERS, IT’S UNLIKELY THAT ANY OF THE DEMANDS, LIKE PAYING BACK TAXES, OR LEARNING ENGLISH WILL NEVER HAPPEN? THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BLANKET AMNESTY OF 1986. Last time the reform added 3.5 million illegal aliens, made up of Guest Workers, and just foreigners. Once given legal status millions vanished into the job market. I am afraid without a solid guarantee from politicians, which I certainly don’t trust these times the number of 11 million are going to be released into America. Unemployed Americans will have no choice, but to compete with the true numbers of illegal migrants and immigrants. Employers don’t care as they have a free market for labor, and that’s exactly what happened in the last mass amnesty. BOMBARD YOUR U.S. SENATORS BY PHONE TODAY and urge them to oppose S.744!

But before anything as extra visas, agriculture jobs are available, we must have a tracking system, so they can be detained if they abscond from a farm or other labor that supposedly Americans will not do. However, none of these new complex reforms can happen, until we are assured that a real fence is constructed and the above mentioned policies?

Thankfully, we can spare ourselves the dizzying asserted logic of such claims by examining recent global sea surface wind data. As Bermuda Triangle-busting science would have it, "NASA" satellite instruments show global sea surface wind speeds have declined rather than increased during the past decade. There you have it folks it is after all the B.S scientific science fiction scare tactics to extract more tax dollars from the real tax payers. See "NASA" said it best.&&&25

In Manila, Catholics pray for smooth succession&&&What smoooth succession??? Vacancy is no longer smooth but an image of a false religion in constant turmoil of herself!!! For the Roman Catholic Church is replete with historical discords during the process of so-called succession to the throne of St. Peter!!! I am wondering who was the one who propelled St. Peter to sainhood!!! Who beatified and canonized St. Peter??? Can any of the low I.Q.s answer the question??? Was Apostle Peter even in Rome??? I pity so much the Roman Catholics who are duped to believe that Apostle Peter was the first "VICARIVS FILII DEI". A BIG LIE!!! For if the matter was true, the Holy writ could had mentioned it!!! Why??? Because the habit of the true Christian Apostles in the first-century Church of Christ was to inform the members of the flock!!! When, in behalf of the Apostles, Apostle John wrote a message to the Christians at the close of the first century, he said: "What we have seen and heard we announce to you also, so that you will join with us in the fellowship that we have with the Father and with His son Jesus Christ." (I John 1:3, Ibid.) John never exhorted the Christians of his time to nurture a fellowship with the Bishop of Rome or any successor of Peter for that matter. He exhorted them to have fellowship with the Father and with the Son. This is because, the Apostles were the ones God had placed in the Church (I Cor. 12:28) Not the Popes. All Roman Catholics, Atheists, Protestants, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists, Bereans, Methodists, Episcopalians, Seventh-day Adventists, Orthodox, Spuious Born-again, Evangelicals, Presbyterians, Skeptics, members of European and American cults, Agnostics must improve their low I.Q.s!!!

Kasich is an elitist just like his democrat counterparts, one side protects the millionaires and the other worships the welfare mommy state!!! Kasich and Bush are responsible for a great deal of damage not only to the republican party but to the country as a whole, they neither recognize nor understand what average people's lives are like, again they are elitist's. The tea party needs to forget about blaming unions for all the country's maladies, it's the welfare mommy state guys!!

Hopefully,this new law considers a proviso for those who have been forced out of America via deportation leaving their young children fatherless or motherless.&&&98

Racist Gangs Took Over LA County Sheriff�s Department, Deputies Claim&&&Deputies at an LA county sheriff�s department allege that their superiors are members of white supremacist gangs and have taken extensive measures to hide at least one inmate from the FBI. Two deputies at the LA County Sheriff�s Office have jointly filed a lawsuit alleging that the department hid an inmate from the FBI, covered up an incident involving a skinhead deputy, threatened to kill the deputies for exposing their gang involvement, and called them �race traitors� and �snitches�. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians 6:12 Jesus said �even the tax collectors and harlots could enter the kingdom of heaven before the Jews,� in Matthew.&&&1

Why Marriage?&&&The same sex crowd is fighting for legal recognition of marriage. Why? Around 20 years ago, Disney recognized for the purposes of insurance and work related benefits domestic partners. Approx 15 yrs ago they extended this to same sex domestic partners. Where one leading business or industry goes, other seem to follow. The battle, from a logistical point of view, would have been to get all domestic partnerships recognized by business, insurance, and government as having all of the benefits (including tax benefits) of actual marriage. Yet, the same sex crowd still pushes marriage. Why? The purpose of marriage from a Scriptural point of view is to introduce this new life form to God. He sees man and wife as one flesh, so it is to introduce them to Him and to receive His approval. In 1 Corinthians 6:9 the Bible states:�What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God�s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men According to the Bible, therefore, same sex intimate relationships are neither pleasing nor recognized by Jehovah. He finds them detestable. Yet it seems the same sex crowd are determined to do their best to force Him to recognize them, and that seems the reason, from a societal point of view, to pursue the idea of marriage&&&2

7 Reasons Not to Swallow Marco Rubio&#x26;#x92;s Immigration Snake...&&&" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida argued this morning on "This Week" that a key provision of the bill, the so-called "pathway to citizenship" for undocumented immigrants, would not give anything away". Sure it does Senator, it gives or sells our American citizenship to 11 million illegal aliens that broke our Immigration Laws to get here! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX It's sad when some politicians and segments of our population want to degrade our American Citizenship to the point where it has no value or meaning. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX "This amnesty will give citizenship to only 1.1 to 1.3 million illegal aliens. We will secure the borders henceforth. We will never again bring forward another amnestybill like this." -- Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy on the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 19869884. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX DEMOCRATS ARE LIARS! "The agreement we just reached is the best possible chance we will have in years to secure our borders, bring millions of people out of the shadows and into the sunshine of America" May 17, 2007 Ted Kennedy -- Senator from Massachusetts Member of the Democratic Party&&&2
Former CIA Director: The Grid Is Vulnerable To Attack&&&"By placing photovoltaic cells on rooftops, batteries in the basement, Americans can have power even if the grid goes down, he said, and even if it�s only 10 to 15 percent of the power supplied by the grid, it�s better than nothing in an emergency." This is the battle royal going on right now with the electric utility industry and the alternative power industry. The electric industry is saying alternative sources of power like wind and solar PV are intermittent and will cause power fluctuations on the grid. The utility industry refuses to give up their monopoly and single source power business model. If the electric utility industry wants to survive, then they will have to change the business model from generation and delivery to generation, storage and delivery. Then the country could actually get away from fossil fuels and supply a great deal of the U.S. energy requirements with alternatively generated electricity. Large grid storage facilities are needed to make this happen. Better interconnection between fractured grid structures across the country and better monitoring of the U.S. grid on the National level.&&&1

Reps challenge DHS ammo buys, say agency using 1,000 more rounds per person than Army&&&Why does Homeland Security need these vast amounts of ammo? Lets leave the politics out of this one, doesn't anyone find this puzzling?

The local people in Boston handled that terrorist attack, why does DHS need so much ammo? What are they expecting? Why NO transparency? They work for us, remember.&&&2

The attack in Boston did not expose any weakness in this system that has served us for years. Why stockpile SO much ammo?????????? This hints of tyranny and we as Americans deserve an answer.&&&3

While making a show of empty-faced americanism, toxic topix AGW deniers, in truth, are communist supporters & always have been. toxic topix AGW deniers actually liked the pollution that the Soviet Union spread around all the countries that were under the yoke of Russia, plus the ability of the communist system to hide the pollution.

Driven to speak out: women want licenses - Wednesday, 24 April 2013 10:00&&&These illegal aliens don't realize a driver license is a fast track to deportation. Any time they commit a felony they can be deported. A felony DUI, a certain dollar amount in a accident, is a felony or a death. Leaving the scene of a accident is also a felony and a deportable offense. Alcoholism runs rampant in the Hispanic community and now you want to put them behind the wheel? Illegal aliens think a DL is a get out of jail free card. Every ticket is a mark on their record until they take away your license and i bet they will still drive. I heard something for the first time the other day about American Indians, something in their genes can't handle alcohol, how about Mexican Indians? Plus the fact driving drunk in Mexico is no big deal. If they speak Spanish then their customs and culture sticks with them too.&&&2

Eagan sends Comcast complaint to senators, FCC&&&Recently Comcast sent me an unsolicited cable tv device to deal with their elimination of analog tv signal service. My service was also changed without my knowledge to include Comcast television. This was never announced to me, and I don't use Comcast voice or tv services, only high speed internet. In fact, I don't even have cable or dish service, only broadcast. I never contacted Comcast to change my service or request the device. They never told us about it in advance. When I contacted them they claimed it was a mistake. When I asked who or when the service change was made to my account, I was told that this "would be forwarded to a supervisor." Obviously they sent these out intentionally to many customers to try and lure more into using Comcast television. They would also charge for monthly use of their device, and charge me if it wasn't returned to them! I had the mistake corrected, and my account has been returned to its previous service level and pricing. It pays to investigate and push back!&&&2

Gun conundrum: Why is ammunition still in short supply?&&&Because Homeland Security has bought about 2 BILLION rounds of ammo, THAT'S why. The Department of Homeland Security is spending more and more on pricey hollow-point bullets for law-enforcement officers -- even as it plans to enforce furloughs and other cuts on Customs and Border Protection employees due to sequestration. The Department of Homeland Security plans to buy more than 1.6 billion rounds over the next five years for training and on-duty purposes. They cite the numerous law enforcement agencies contained within the department with employees who carry weapons. But the purchases have led to criticism that the agency is spending money on bullets that can cost twice as much as regular ammo -- and questions over whether those bullets are really needed for training purposes.... WHY does homeland security need that much ammo? WHO ARE THEY GOING TO USE IT AGAINST?&&&2

What are Obama's options on Syria?&&&Obama is isolationist who acts like an Ostrich, closing his eyes to the danger to the American people with the proliferation of WMDs mounted on Scuds missiles that can hit America. Obama is the most incompetent commander in chief in US history who will never stand up to Putin and to the Iranian regime that are partners with the North Koreans and the Syrians in using nukes and WMDs warheads mounted on ballistic missile to attack America and its allies from air sea and land. The American people that were surprised about the failure of the CIA and FBI to deal with the treat to America from Jihadist terrorist such as the Boston Bombers should wake up to see that Obama represent naked and empty Emperor that will not do anything to protect America before America is attacked first by the Jihadist and communist regimes of Iran and North Korea. In fact, GOP Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham proved that they cannot influence Obama�s pacifist type policy of losers.&&&4

Sequester Could Close Local Air Traffic Towers&&&I did notice in Mondays paper the Air Traffic Control tower may be closed. Today, FS School superintendent Benny Goodin stated in the paper the sequester would hurt our local schools. Sorry Benny, but the president elected to go this way back in 2011 and after all, it is only 2.5 cents cut. I'm sure Benny believes in a budget plan and since our President hasn't seen the need to prepare a budget in the past, maybe in the future we can plan and prepare a budget. One such plan would allow all agencies to cut 1 penny of every dollar. Not rocket science, just more efficient spending of taxpayers money.&&&19

Cruz vs. Rubio on immigration&&&" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida argued this morning on "This Week" that a key provision of the bill, the so-called "pathway to citizenship" for undocumented immigrants, would not give anything away". Sure it does Senator, it gives or sells our American citizenship to 11 million illegal aliens that broke our Immigration Laws to get here! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX It's sad when some politicians and segments of our population want to degrade our American Citizenship to the point where it has no value or meaning. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX "This amnesty will give citizenship to only 1.1 to 1.3 million illegal aliens. We will secure the borders henceforth. We will never again bring forward another amnestybill like this." -- Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy on the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 19869884.&&&3

I AM LEAVING TEXAS WITH THE POLICE ACTING ON LOCAL LIES ABOUT ME&&&I am a supporter of law and order who is being harassesd in Texas by the police and I am laving the state with limited funds, as quickly as I am leave so no one else will endanger my public reputation or freedom as a person. This is a copy of my personal correspondence nad is not a condemnation of the United States or its government, including police, but reflects some of my consistently terrible experience in the state of Texas. Hi Ada - Unfortunatelty, I was subjected to police and merchant harassment today in the "white" I guess side of this city, at least where a coffee shop or merchant called "Shipley's" is and the "Dollar Plus" stores are, that I would ordinarily use. There was what appeared to be a small but growing crowd of people already there inside early this morning when I walked over, across the railroad tracks from the motel area where I am subjected to vehicle mobs on the streets that seem to be running before I even get up - a "car jail" that seems to surround wherever I go, starting with McPherson Square in Washington, D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia - do you remember how they used to surround us when we tried to go anywhere from that house on Queens Gate Court on the border of Fairfax and Alexandria Coutnies? when you were renting the room and I was your houseguest? They seem to be running the country wherever I go - SUVs with plenty of men and excessive numbers of women driving and never stopping. I never see them park and get out of the vehicles and they aggress alll day every day, including Sunday where no one seems to enjoy going to church anymore anywhere in Texas, or DC for that matter, as I recall I was blocked from attending by constant "problems"y time I tried to attend Easter Service at the National Cathedral, for example, and a real gang in a shelter in Alexandria (Braddock Road area - Carpenter's Shelter) where I stayed briefly surrounded me and kept me from leaving one Easter. It is racial in its thrust, anti-white "lady" The manager, I guess, called the local police and lied to them, stating I was "panhandling" and "causing problems" there. They stopped me on the sidewalk where I was in a conversation with a local lady about my age, or a little older, with her small dog. She was forced to leave as they were unfriendly, and hte man threatened to put me in jail if I didn't pass his call to the police to see if there were any violations. I am leaving Arlington as soon as you send me the moneyk, or I may stay in the motel room another day, but no more. I am persecuted in this country and there is no doubt that the police intend to do me in, with apparently permission from everyone who holds authority in teh country as it is never a priority to do a damned thing for me. I am taking some of my work off the internet, adn would appreciate it if you can print out some of my better works and keep hard copies for just you and me. I do not intened to go on as an American writer where I am being openly murdered and harassed, including the police state itself. Iam unappreciated and they believe lies about me -- a well-dressed lady in new clothes I bought just the other week in Ross's. Love to you, but I do not advise you to come to Texas. I was going to think about staying here locally, but of course, now I cannot. The woman I spoke to told me that she had been injured in an accident, and has trouble walking or does not go out that much anymore .. something like that. I am not blaming individuals, and I had thought Arlington was a place I could settle down for awhile and participate in the local economy and churches, suppor the nice people who do live here - but with the police harassment, no one (or only whomever are the "chosen few" - I don't know who they are) can relax or live a normal life here, in my opinion.&&&1
Rick Santorum Wants to Fight 'The Dangers Of Contraception'&&&from the article "...it�s a license to do things in the sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be.

That�s the perfect way that a sexual union should happen. We take any part of that out, we diminish the act. And if you can take one part out that�s not for purposes of procreation, that�s not one of the reasons, then you diminish this very special bond between men and women" Read more: Tranlated: We need to put the fear of pregnancy back into heterosexual sex.

Congressman seeks answers on Spires&&&The fact that a respected Representative would take the time and effort to publicly chastise a high ranking Cabinet-level Secretary only adds fuel to the speculation. Instead of firing off a letter for public dissemination, why didn't one of the Member's senior staff simply pick up the phone and call the Secretary? The press has conistently reported that this a "personnel matter" which explains why there has been a repeated retorts from DHS that "We don't commment on personnel matters." With such matters, the accused has privacy rights and generally, the matter is reviewed by an independent party and a recommendation made to the organization's senior official. Until that review is completed, the pundits can only speculate based on rumors and inuendo about what's going on. And given the wide range of rumors floating around, it's best to be patient and let the official process unfold. Another question raised is whether the White House was consulted on Mr. Spires' leave situation. One can bet a month of lunches that because Mr. Spires is an appointee, the action was cleared by the White House Political Personnel Office. I suspect they too are letting the investigative process play out. So, my advice is for everyone to just "chill-out" and not draw inflammatory conclusions on facts that have yet to be revealed. So,&&&1

Top congressional Democrats, White House negotiate with Republicans to ease FAA furloughs&&&It's about time! The air traffic controllers did not create the debt. Also what about Congress? They are not taking a pay cut. Starting next month the IRS will start furloughs. The IRS brings in 92% of the money that Crongress waste. The IRS can not strike but they can slow down the audits and collections of money that would go to congress. The IRS has not had a cost of living raise since Obama was elected in 2008 and they are asked to give up at least 10% of their salary and Obama gave up 5%. Congress needs some days without pay. Also they need to figure out how to pay the bills and not depend on hard working people to take over debt. Nobody pays a neighbors debt, so why should air trafic controllers and the IRS pay the debt of the country. If that is the case then all of America needs to chip in.&&&2

Kerry Forgot Rule Number One: Never Question the Sacred Israeli Narrative&&&"I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view has not changed (It was a GENOCIDE). A full, frank, and just acknowledgement of the facts is in all of our interests. Nations grow stronger by acknowledging and reckoning with painful elements of the past, thereby building a foundation for a more just and tolerant future. We appreciate this lesson in the United States, as we strive to reconcile some of the darkest moments in our own history. We recognize those courageous Armenians and Turks who have already taken this path, and encourage more to do so, with the backing of their governments, and mine." President OBAMA 24/4/2013 Background info: The 12 Nov 1914 turkish Jihad fatwa propping WWI entry was based on a LIE; IT (CUP) Ottoman turks attacked Russia first for no reason and not the other way around. Therefore IT turks, as aggressor criminals, abused Islam and Allah by declaring an uncalled for JIHAD. JIHAD is supposed to be "struggle to excell" But the turks abused it as a tool for their Turk Islam Empire dream. The Fatwa implied Ottoman Armenians and other Anatolian Christians as targets by not keeping them exempt, like it clearly did for their Christian Allies, Germans and Austrians, from hostilities ordered by the Jihad fatwa. Finally, the TEHCIR (deportation)law specifically declared and exposed Armenians as open TARGETS for extermination, sanctioned by the Jihad Fatwa. Therefore, instead of denying, Unless TR comes out clean and admits that; the Armenian Genocide was a direct outcome of Nov 1914 (Fake)Jihad Declaration and the proceeding 1915 TEHCIR (deportation) Law exposing the Armenians and other Civilian Christians of the region as ENEMIES paraded as TARGETS to be exterminated, TR will be regarded as the immoral promoter of the similar "Jihadist" Terror happening all over the world today. Those individuals giving support to the Turkish State DENIAL policy in the name of LOYALTY are wanton culprits in this crime against humanity.&&&1

U.S. officials cite small-scale chemical weapons use by Assad in Syria&&&Obama and Hagel using �Ostrich� tactics of delusional disconnection from reality when it is about the security of the American people under threats of nukes and WMDs. They represent incompetent and dysfunctional regime that will do nothing to deal with reality around the world and with dangers of WMDs to US allies and to the American people. Undoubtedly, while the facts on the ground show that The Iranian-Syrian-Russian axis of evil in Syria are using sarin gas against the Syrian children and women and launch missiles and rockets that are equipped with chemical warhead, Obama is keeping American military isolated from the world and breaking his promises to prevent the use of WMDs against the Syrian people and US allies including Turkey and Israel. Obama and Chuck Hagel proved to be pacifists that will not deal with the threats to the American people and to the world from WMDs including nukes and sarin gas attacks. The liberal ruled Congress proved to silently follow Obama isolationist agenda like blind herd of sheep hauled to the slaughter house. The isolation policy of Obama is ruing the national security of each and every American and letting the world falling apart in flames and this situation will not keep American people safe whatsoever. Will GOP Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham stand up to protect the world from falling into WMD all out war and setting the entire Middle East and its oil fields on fire by the Iranian-Syrian-Russian axis of evil?&&&3
Samurai Sword-Wielding Mormon Bishop Saves Woman from Mugger&&&The Bishop should have disembowled the scum. But then communist American media would have pulished a photo of the mugger when he was 11 years old, comnpletey innocent-looking. The media would have called for the crucifixion of the Bishop. Sorta like that scumbag black gang banger, TRAYVON MARTIN who was jutifiably killed by patriot Zimmerman when MARTIN tried to kill him. The communist media made a martyr out of MARTIN. The media pubished an innocent photo of MARTIN when he was 12 years old. They said MARTIN was completely innocent and was attacked for absolutely no reason by Zimmerman. They did not show any current photos. MARTIN was actually 6-2 tall and weighed 175 pounds. He had jailhoue tattoos all over his body, including his face. His lenghy criminal record was intentially omitted by the media. He was a drug dealer, among other things. And Barrack Hussein Obama was quoted as saying, "If I ever have a son, I wish he would be like MARTIN".&&&5

Morris Dees - Jewish Pervert Advises DHS on Patriots&&&Morris Dees - Jewish Pervert Advises DHS on Patriots There is nothing resembling "poverty" about the "Southern Poverty Law Center." It is a law firm (212 employees) that, since 1971, has grown rich by stigmatizing Conservative groups as violent haters, bigots and Nazis. This includes , the John Birch Society and, lately, even men's rights groups. It has raised a $220 million endowment by convincing rich liberals that the US is on the verge of Nazi takeover. Despite claiming to be a "non-profit," Dees is a multimillionaire. Dees is now advising the DHS that the groups on his hate list are "domestic extremists." How long until they are rounded up and put into FEMA camps? Who is Morris Dees? The steamy summary below of his 1979 divorce proceedings reveals that he is a typical Sabbatean Jewish (Illuminati, Satanist) pervert. It reads like an episode of "Madmen." - See more at: ...&&&1

Wei Liu: My Life in China 1.1B: My Home in China&&&The Series Books of My Life in China Wei Liu: My Life in China 1.1B: My Home in China Wei Liu April 2013 Outside our home is a long, dingy corridor, 6 feet wide and 100 yards long, with both sides being all the rooms and my home is one of them. Right outside my home, to the west is a 3 feet long, over 1 foot wide and tall wooden cage. My Mom and Dad use it to raise the chicken either a cock or hen for eggs and chicken meat. Buying a chicken is too expensive. Right to the east of my home is a coal stove, having a 10 centimeter diameter, 3 feet long iron pipe, an iron hook as its accessories. The diagram is the following. It will be a pity if the forum does not let me post the diagram. When using the long iron pipe, we put it on the top of the coal stove. The iron pipe is all hollow. Its purpose is to prevent the air entering the stove from the top, to facilitate the oxygen to enter the stove from the bottom of the stove, to facilitate the dioxide to emit from the top of the iron pipe, then facilitate the coal to burn. This is only used for cooking. In other times, people do not want the coal to burn that fast and of course will not use the iron pipe. In the early 1970s, 100 pounds of coal costs about 3 Chinese yuan in China. Look at the two sides outside my home, one side being a chicken cage, the other being a coal stove. Probably there isn�t much chance for us to starve to death. Other families put their home stuff in the corridor as well, coal stoves, bamboo beds, basin shelves, etc. Then the usable width of the corridor gets reduced from 6 feet to 3 feet. On the second floor of the dorm, where my home is, there are 2 public kitchens on the east side and the other 2 on the west side. The whole floor is about 100 yards long, with about 50 rooms next to each other and facing each other. Every room is 180 square feet, living a family like us. 12 families share a public kitchen, which is the same size of a family room. In other words, about 50 people share a 180 square feet public kitchen. Living on the second floor, when we want to go to the toilet, we have to go downstairs for there is no toilet on the second floor. Simply speaking about 200 people share a 180 square feet public toilet that has 8 squat compartments. The first floor looks the same as the second floor, also many people, dark room, long dingy corridor. The floor of the first floor is not wooden floor as that of the second floor, but a mixture of soil and cement, with some place uneven, not any better than the ground outside. The third floor is the auditorium of the hospital. This is the whole building, where I, Wei Liu, live. Shortly after I was born, there is no breast milk for me to eat. My Mom and Dad send me to an old lady called Chen to raise. That is a dingy, shabby room, having a folding bed, an old, dingy picture hung on an old dingy wall. One day Chen�s family is there, with one making a kind of milky food for me. �Why do you give that baby this kind of food to eat?� old lady Chen asks. �Well, we have been paid by the parents,� another voice, may be Chen�s daughter. �We need food too��I make meals for our family. Do you guys know how hard it is to make a family meal now,� Chen says. �But��� The rest see the reply. ********** More articles of mine both Chinese and English are in my blog Public Worker, Comrade, Awakened People, Democratic People, Common People Wei Liu 2013 Mail: &#65288;Please keep your letter within 4 pages and no parcel.&#65289; Wei Liu Bemidji, MN 56601 U.

The Boston Bombers, "Comprehensive Immigration Reform," And The National Question&&&Clearly, nobody know who are the faceless and nameless people that are illegal invaders that do not pay taxes and live on food stamps from Obama. Clearly, even if the Mozlem Brother terrorists in the 11 million invaders consists of 5%, their number will be 550,000 terrorists and criminals that need more than 700,000 police officers and FBI agents to stop attacking America and destroying it from within. It is time to save America from the sold out gang of eight Senators that are blind to see America becoming the land of the world's terrorists and criminals but not the land of the Americans. Clearly, John McCain and Lindsey Graham represent RINOs that go blind after Obama's agenda and will never stand up for American people. GOP is wrong to send John McCain and Lindsey Graham that go by what the media says and what the polls about the immigration say. The result is selling America to the terrorists and criminals of the world that will come easily with extended visas or through the open borders to get Obama's food stamps and Obama phone in return for voting Obama. The immigration laws are not enforced by Obama who makes his own rules so why bother to write new laws that would not be enforced by Obama who needs votes first and cannot care less about who vote for him. GOP will cease to exist as a party when the Mozlem Brother will become a voting bloc of 10% that will control the destiny of America to fall apart as a country.&&&3

Fariss campaign manager said Wednesday that Fariss was not available for comment.... Fariss, who has refused to talk to The News & Advance of Lynchburg about any of his legal issues, is getting financial support from state Republican Party officials for his campaign, which is making heavy use of mailed brochures. Some of them describe his family values. A Lynchburg police officer asked a city magistrate to issue an emergency protective order on March 9, 2002, that required Fariss to stay away from a Lynchburg woman. The officer request said the woman stated to me that Fariss broke through her back door to gain entry into her house when she told him to leave. History of violence. (unquote) The Police report notes 'History of violence'. If anyone has not demanded the resignation or removal of Honorable Mr Fariss - for history of violence - one wonders about motivations in demanding resignation or removal of Honorable Mr Dumler - for history of violence We support requesting any elected official who has committed violence - against humans or against animals - to resign from those duties. In Southern Albemarle County that would include Honorable Mr Dumler and Honorable Mr Fariss.&&&97

Appeals court vacates Detroit arsonist's sentence in light of error&&&It's a case of the criminal's dilemma. Two people do a crime. If both refuse to talk, sometimes both will walk. Maybe the evidence is not so strong and two trials are costly. So the prosecutor selects the weaker less guilty party and offers a deal to implicate the other party at full sentencing. In this case a deal was made and everybody pretended it did not exist. How this could go through a pre-sentence hearing and not be brought out requires negligence, stupidity or criminal behavior by the prosecutor.&&&1

The ruling class in the Japanese society believes that the class is the people who exploit the rest of the people and that the rest of the people only exist as the slaves who only serve the ruling class.&&&1

Soon they see the truth getting south of their border and then Mr. Bill and Obama and Al Gore and the rest of the STUPID GULLIBLE LIBERALS out there will be laughed at as idiots as they should have been this whole time we've been hearing about CO2 and the rest of the phoney Obama lying bullshit.&&&11

In immigration bill, answers and practical questions&&&I just read the article about Schummer and Mc Cain discussing reform. But the questions asked reflected the Nationals in Boston. How did they become citizens in 5 year's? One of the questions? Was there a background check? No, had there been one, the elder Brother had been flagged in Russia for sending out radical tweet's to his radical friends. How can we ever know who is here? Those are just some of the questions that Boston terrorist's have brought to the immigration debate. We can only hope someone with common sense in Washington will prevail. People aren't in the white heat they were in two weeks ago to get the bill on the floor.&&&37
Grassley tries (and fails) to explain why Boston attacks should derail immigration reform&&&By the immigration legislation, you'll know the wise from the fools, the fit from the unfit, the one with common sense from those without.

Rubio Is Trying, But His Plan Is Unworkable&&&We finally hear the truth or sort of. I've been screaming on this forum for month's. They don't want to become Americanized. They want to use this Country, steal all they can, remit to Mexihell what they earn and eventually leave us holding the bill's. It's so stupid... So stupid. Just give them temp. Work permit's to pick crops if they honestly think that's what Mexicans are doing!!! HA. They want all the perks of citizenship, without the responsibility. And Rubio does want them to start paying the piper. Which is understandable, but they won't even apply. They'll continue to break our laws, refuse to assimilate,and we won't enforce our laws as they are written today. Limbaugh interviewed Rubio last week, and questioned him as to why we should reward this 11 million illegals over the people outside the Country that played by the rules??/ Rubio had some lame answer and today Limbaugh repeated the question, Why reward lawbreaker's that don't want to learn our language or assimilate as American's. They won't, because they don't want to be American.Period.&&&2

Airport Delays Raise Questions About Controller Furloughs&&&The Mozlem Brother scholar of Indonesia Madrassa Barack Hussein Obama is representing America hating liberal agenda that aimed at hurting American people with lies and deceit while transferring trillions of dollars from the hard working Americans to his liberal parasitic votes that live on his free food stamps and free Obama phone. Obama is pushing American economy to its lowest level of working Americans with 90 million Americans including our young generation out of work and 62 million willingly unemployed and willingly disable getting up to $40,000 a year without working for the rest of their lives. His hatred to Americans brings Obama to cause them as much grief as possible in airports because Obama needs the money of the furloughs to buy more votes of parasites for the 201 elections.&&&7
Lawsuit Filed Over County's Immigration Detainee Policy&&&Judicial Watch has every right to sue over this. No illegal alien that has been involved in an Auto Accident while driving here without legality should never be released to the general population. They're here illegally, driving illegally without insurance, creating big problems for all of our Community's and yet if it were up to the Obam regime, they'd have the complete run of the U.S. Ambro2000 talks about their crimes being minor. They shouldn't be considered criminals. What will it take. More death's, more smuggling, more drug's, more human smuggling and prostitution WHAT???? This isn't Mexihell yet?

Delaware flood plain maps revamped with radar, satellites&&&1. A "Budget Report" is a selective funding of x accounts from x resources (set up to be primarily funded with taxation and it is for "the year") 2. An "Annual Financial Report" is the showing of "all" income: Investment; taxation; and Enterprise, plus the "accumulated wealth over decades. Budgets are for the year, an AFR is for it all since creation of the entity. Could be a showing for several decades if be, for over a century. There is a big difference between a 1-year budget and an Annual Financial Report. A correct analogy would be: The budget to operate your house vs. your statement of net worth. The public has been played with the biggest shell game of selective presentation there is allowing for massive fortunes to be made by the inside players over the last several decades with the full symbiotic cooperation of the syndicated media, controlled education, and BOTH main political parties... "Every" investment fund large and small is a power base. Where that money is invested determines what company; real-estate venture, etc., is made or broken. Thus in line with that, never a mention of the USA 184,000 AFRs of the corresponding local governments in Canada too ... nor the many thousands of specialty investment funds they contain. We also note gov pension funds facilitate the same power base. Paying employee benefits from the return on the funds is an after thought for the government players. Where the funds are invested internationally and with whom is the primary focus. The head communists back in the 30's and 40's said they could take over America without fireing a shot. The undercurrents of that statement were that they could depend on the greed and opportunity of the players to accomplish that goal and it clearly did. USA Local and Federal Collective government since 2000 brings in more gross income derived "GLOBALLY" (Investment-Tax-Enterprise) than the entire gross income of the population of the United States. Taxation is rammed down the public's throat (1/3rd of the gross income) and Investment / Enterprise income (2/3rd of the gross income) the "silence is golden" rule is strictly enforced due to the money and wealth involved with the full symbiotic cooperation of the syndicated media; controlled education; and both main political parties as has applied over the last century. Try to get your News / Political / School Representative, any of them to make simple mention of the CAFR as "THE" local government financial document to carefully look at, mentioned in an open and public forum and see what happens.

It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The Republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president."___ManBearPig&&&5

US immigration bill could slow Indian outsourcers&&&Nobody knows what kind of anarchy and chaos will the new immigration law bring to America that will become the world open border land of the every poor, parasites and criminals. Clearly, nobody knows who are the faceless and nameless people that are illegal invaders that do not pay taxes and live on food stamps from Obama. Clearly, even if the Mozlem Brother terrorists in the 11 million invaders consists of 5%, their number will be 550,000 terrorists and criminals that need more than 700,000 police officers and FBI agents to stop attacking America and destroying it from within. It is time to save America from the sold out gang of eight Senators that are blind to see America becoming the land of the world's terrorists and criminals but not the land of the Americans. Clearly, John McCain and Lindsey Graham represent RINOs that go blind after Obama's agenda and will never stand up for American people. GOP is wrong to send John McCain and Lindsey Graham that go by what the media says and what the polls about the immigration say. The result is selling America to the terrorists and criminals of the world that will come easily with extended visas or through the open borders to get Obama's food stamps and Obama phone in return for voting Obama. The immigration laws are not enforced by Obama who makes his own rules so why bother to write new laws that would not be enforced by Obama who needs votes first and cannot care less about who vote for him. GOP will cease to exist as a party when the Mozlem Brother will become a voting bloc of 10% that will control the destiny of America to fall apart as a country.&&&1

It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The Republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president."&&&3

Israel already KNOWS THAT!! Israel was the first to pre-emptively DESTROY Sadaam's nuclear power plant a couple of decades ago (Osirak nuclear facility near Baghdad, 1981). Does Hagel think, somehow, that Israel was just waiting to hear that HE THINKS IT'S OK for them to do it?? Israel does not need his approval!! Our Pentagon chief should already KNOW that. He is looking rather foolish!&&&6
Graham backs off FBI criticism over bombing suspect&&&The sold-out Lindsey Graham and John McCain of the 'eight gangsters' from Senate are selling America to the world's most dangerous criminals and Jihadist terrorists with lies to the American people. The Obama regime could have stopped and arrest the terrorist that attacked Boston Marathon based on the Russian information and warning that he is dangerous Jihadist terrorist that has connections with al Qaida. Nevertheless, Obama regime did nothing to stop the attack by Jihadists on the runners and funs of the Boston marathon and even did not recognize the picture of the suspect terrorists that supposedly was interviewed by the FBI. In addition, Obama rushed to release 2000 illegal invader criminals that were held in prisons because he claimed the �sequester� makes it impossible to keep them in prison. Both cares prove that Obama will not keep any immigration law that John McCain and Lindsey Graham offers him and he will buy the votes of every illegal invader with food stamps and Obama phone in order to win the 2014 elections, regardless of any security and �closing the border� clause in the bill. When the Obama regime makes his own rules and cannot are less about the constitution, the immigration law will bring to America millions of illegal Mozlem Brother terrorists that ruin the daily security of every American child, woman and man with daily suicide bombing attacks.&&&13
Professor blames mass shootings on 'white male privilege'&&&The only serious white male privilege that exist today are the legal privileges granted by big government to Diversity white males. Diversity white males include jewish white male, disabled white male, queer white males, and hispanic white male. Here are some of their legal privileges: Jewish White Male - slavish govt support for Israel, Wall Street TARP bailouts, hate speech prosecutions, holocaust museums, selective tax breaks and credits, neocon war-mongering, anti-discrimination laws, govt set-aside contracts Disabled White Male - disability pensions, premium health care, preferential parking and public access, Affirmative Action, National Health Care Queer White Male - sodomy civil rights, abortion civil rights, AIDS hysteria, hate speech prosecution, Wall Street TARP bailouts, anti-discrimination law, National Health Care Hispanic White Male - anti-discrimination law, illegal alien amnesty, Affirmative Action, govt set-aside contracts In the case of Adma Lanza, his white male privilege was that he was queer. The privilege he received is a complete news blackout of his queer status, and how his gayness led him to a gay-rage rampage attack on children.&&&4

Citizenship backed for Va.'s illegal immigrants&&&" Republican Sen.

Sure it does Senator, it gives or sells our American citizenship to 11 million illegal aliens that broke our Immigration Laws to get here! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX It's sad when some politicians and segments of our population want to degrade our American Citizenship to the point where it has no value or meaning. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX "This amnesty will give citizenship to only 1.1 to 1.3 million illegal aliens. We will secure the borders henceforth. We will never again bring forward another amnesty bill like this." -- Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy on the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX DEMOCRATS ARE LIARS! "The agreement we just reached is the best possible chance we will have in. years to secure our borders, bring millions of people out of the shadows and. into the sunshine of America". May 17, 2007.

Hannity Panel of Black Conservatives Bashes the Left's Attempt...&&&The Democratic Progressive Party Sees "Blacks" as "Useful Idiots" PROOF THE RACIST DEMOCRAT PARTY NEVER SWITCHED This is a clear example of Black democrat puppets being used to carry out and act out the very thoughts and attitudes of an inherently Racist Democrat Party. Democrats have a long history of projecting their own racism on Republicans and Conservatives who fought against it - Black Republicans and Conservatives. I am an African-American and I belong to the Tea Party. I am so sick and tired of these Black Democrat getting away with doing racist dirty work of their Racist Plantation operators in the Democrat Party. In EVERY SINGLE ELECTION CYCLE the Democrat party is to only prancing around like sissies in pink underwear yelling "racist! racist!" Even though they're the PARTY actually BEING RACIST; the progressives in the Democrat Party. They just can't stand the fact that Black's have grabbed a hold of the American Dream and have become successful, because democrats have only wanted us to be victims dependent on the American Government. Examining Black Loyalty to Democrats These racist democrats use misguided people like Morgan Freeman to be so focused on a Racist past while ignoring the FACT that those original Racists were democrats and still are. It's no wonder that Democrat party talks about race so much, because they are the Party of the Slave owner Willie Lynch, Jim Crow Laws, and the KKK. Black American's Brave History pt.1 Black American's Brave History pt.2 Democrats spend millions of dollars every year to keep Blacks and Hispanics in a racially divided mental state in order to trick them into voting for the very DEMOCRAT PARTY that has DONE NOTHING for us for years, which purposely keeps us economically and educationally depressed. Liberal democrats are merely trying to reinforce "the illusion" that republicans and conservative are racist, because its a tactic used to keep blacks in their place voting for the democrat party, a party that has been and is directly involved in Black Genocide within America for years through Planned Parenthood. Liberals, like socialists, try to make blacks feel helpless and dependent on an ever increasing federal government just the slave owners made Blacks feel helpless and dependent without the care of their Slave Master's plantation. Exposing Racist Hypocrisy in Liberal Media Today both Blacks and Hispanics are waking up to these old tactics by trying to inflict minorities with psychological co-dependent attitudes and are not being hoodwinked by the socialist progressive Liberal Mainstream Media and Media Matters. Today, Blacks and Hispanics understand that those who blindly vote the Democrat Party line are "The Real Sellouts" who have sold themselves into modern day slavery! For the past 40 years, the Democrat party has been run by Domestic Terrorists, Baby Killers, Sexual Deviates, Islamic Extremists, Socialists, Communists, Racists, the KKK, and Organized Crime. No wonder so many more people are waking up and leaving the Democrat party by the hundreds of thousands. The Democrat party is the party of the slave owner, and their prime objective is to keep their Black and Hispanic voters unaware, uninformed, disconnected from reality, and distracted. Remember this is the same Democrat Party that arrested Martin Luther King Jr (who was a republican) down south then had him assassinated, just as they colluded with communist Russia to have President John F. Kennedy assassinated because the Socialist Progressives in America were and still are puppets of the foreign governments of Communist China and Russia!

Re: Republicans and Blacks: The GOP Wants To Try Talking To Black...&&&Check out the latest drone technology. From mosquitos to microscopic nano drones they're going to be everywhere. Hey look at the bright side, at least the drones will replace those noisy peeping tom helicopters. Seriosly though, why the hell isn't anyone saying anything? Just like the street cameras and now buble sidewalk cameras, snuck in directly next to them. Look at those 360 degree pan zoom sidewalk cameras being snuk in all of a sudden on top of the lamp posts. What do sidewalk cameras have to do with traffic flow again? Not to mention all the high curbed traffic dividing islands being put in so we can't avoid future TSA checkpoints.

Why Ann Romney is wrong&&&Ann Romney is right to claim that without Obama's push for the artificial sequester, there was no need for it. Four big lies of the liberal media led by the CNN who vowed to protect Obama from the truth and reality and cover up his failure to work for the American people. Obama is sending billions of dollars through the IMF and directly and in addition free F-16 and Abrams tanks to his Mozlem Brother friends in Egypt under the dictator Morsi who oppresses his people and mostly women and Christians. Obama keeps buying more and more oil from the Mozlem Brother regimes and ban the oil pipe and the drilling in Federal waters and lands of America which could save more than 5 trillion dollars in 10 years to the American people while Obama prefers to enrich the enemies of America including the Iranian that rush to the nukes and the Saudi Arabian regime that finance the al Qaida terrorists in Asia and Africa with 5 trillions. Obama is feeding more than 30 millions of his liberal base of parasite mostly Blacks, Hispanics and Asians that do not pay taxes and willingly are unemployed or disabled. Obama needs more money for more than 165 million illegal invaders for buying their votes with food stamps, free Obama phone, free Obama care only to defeat the GOP control the House after 2014 elections.&&&75

After North Korea threat, White House says US can defend itself against attack&&&The incompetent commander in chief Obama together with the same Old GOP RINOs John McCain believe that the UN will save the American people from nuke attack by the North Korea-Iranian �Russian axis of evil but the American people deserve better than empty UN protection. Obama is pushing America to major defeat all over the world as no country treats America today as the used to be superpower. Evidently, North Korean regime that is cooperating with the Iranian and Russian regime against America realized that Obama is the naked Emperor who has no clothes. Obama was able to destroy the deterrent power of America and bring second rate Secretary of Defense that knows nothing about defending America. The American people believe that America is protected from North Korean nuke attack based on the Obama deceitful liberal media that keeps lying to the American people. Obama declared more than a year ago that US Military cannot fight two enemies at the time and the fact that Obama offered sequester to slash US military power and eliminate the US �old� Nukes while putting on hold the anti-missile system that could protect America from North Korean and Iranian missile attack means that America is not protected. The unbelievable weakness and hesitance of the incompetent commander in chief Obama means that the enemies of America are not afraid to threat the American people with nuke attack when there is no American means to protect the American people by the failed Obama regime.&&&116

Supreme Court cases put spotlight on gay parenting&&&The rabidly religious want to prevent gays from being parents. If any of them spew that bullshit, remind them of Earl "Butch" Kimmerling. Kimmerling is a heterosexual, gay-hating, fundy christard who opposed the adoption of children by gay men. He went so far as to adopt a young girl to prevent a gay man from adopting her. Within six months of adoption, Kimmerling had sexually molested and raped the girl. So much for "protecting" her. The assholes who seek to prevent gay people from adoption aren't "trying to prevent abuse". They're trying to (a) make the public hate an easy target and misdirect public attention, and (b) make it easier for themselves to abuse and rape children. If you disagree, look at catholic priests.&&&29

Science disproves global warming&&&The science of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere serving as a greenhouse gas was well established by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, so there is no valid argument that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere does not cause global warming. "Long-time greens are painfully aware that the arguments of global warming skeptics are like zombies in a '70s B movie. They get shot, stabbed, and crushed, over and over again, but they just keep lurching to their feet and staggering forward. That's because -- news flash!-- climate skepticism is an ideological, not a scientific, position, and as such it bears only a tenuous relationship to scientific rules of evidence and inference." --David Roberts, The Nation, 24 February 2008&&&5235

What the Gosnell Abortion Trial Really Shows Us&&&Wondered how long it would take before this case was framed by the pro-choice folks....since the so-called 'pro-life'(geez what a misnomer) folks got hold of it the day the authorities FINALLY busted this guy, and have been running with it firmly in their foaming jaws ever since. This case is about MEDICAL MALPRACTICE. It should have been a pro-choice reporter who broke this story, if the pro-choice folks wanted to claim any validity afterward. It is obvious to even the casual observer, that we have not only dropped the ball on this, but kicked it firmly into the other guy's lap. It must be understood that Gosnell was not typical of abortion providers, anymore than whoever-it-was that killed Dr. Tiller was typical of abortion opponents. He was a BAD DOCTOR, who broke the law over and over again. It must be understood that if more and more women are denied access to clinically and medically safe abortions, then the Gosnells of the world will increase in number - women aren't going to stop having abortions because they have to go to Gosnell to get them, and this is a capitalist society. Quacks make a LOT of money, when their marks are desperate. It's the way of the world. The so-called "pro-life" faction knows this all too well - and it couldn't care any less. Which is why their relentless assault on the right to choose, is working. Clinics across the country have closed, as a result of passing more (and ever more ridiculous) regulations, designed to 'legislate them out of existence.' Access to abortion has declined by 50%, or more, in nearly every state. In addition, this case exemplifies a failure to enforce sensible and ubiquitous regulations ALREADY ON THE BOOKS IN EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY, on medical clinics. This serves no one well, and should have been immediately addressed. If we are to have accredited abortion providers, we must prevent and expose the criminals who prey on desperate pregnant women. Our attention is needed on the salient fact that women WILL retain the right to our own decisions, and accept the responsibility for exercising them, whether or not it is legal. The primary result of removing the law-abiding clinics (and the so-called 'pro-life' folks are gettin' her done) is that Gosnell and his ilk will replace them. Pro-life my hind portion.&&&1

Why does Boston celebrate Martial Law with chants of �USA, USA�?&&&Why does Boston celebrate Martial Law with chants of �USA, USA�? Last night in Boston, following the apprehension of a 19 year old student suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, crowds poured on to the streets of Watertown and surrounding boroughs, celebrating what they believe was an end of their terrible ordeal which began on Monday Create Chaos & Order Video Shows Home Searches By Boston Police Were NOT Voluntary Video evidence like the Youtube video seen above has begun to surface documenting how the house-to-house searches conducted by Boston Police, federal agents, and SWAT were most certainly not voluntary. Videos like the one seen above have begun gaining serious traction on Youtube and other video sharing websites, which show how police actually surrounded private homes with armed military-style squads and then proceeded to enter said homes while taking the homeowners at gun point. American Terror: Manufactured by the FBI The Boston Marathon bombing has provoked shock, grief and outrage from around the world. After decades of conditioning, the public automatically equates such terrorism with Muslim radicals. But the evidence shows that every major terror plot on American soil in the past 10 years has been fostered, funded and equipped by one organization: the FBI\ 50 YEARS LATER ~~ FROM THE GHETTOS OF BIRMINGHAM TO THE GHETTOS OF PALESTINE Numerous studies document an increasingly frightened, racist society: large numbers of Israeli Jews would not allow an Arab in their home, neighborhood, or children�s school, favor preference for Jews over Arabs in governmental hiring, and both societies live increasingly ghettoized lives. VIDEO: Argentina'Huge' Meteor This Morning � 4/21/2013 Jura Lina � The Jewish Hand in Communism Not Mentioned at School This documentary film titled,�In The Shadow of Hermes� was produced by Juri Lina, and is based on his excellent book, Under the Sign of the Scorpion, which is one of the best overview�s of the Khazarian (not real Jews) takeover of Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution . This film shows how the Freemasons, the international bankers, and the communists joined forces in an unholy alliance and through the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 established in Russia the most brutal and dehumanizing slave society the world has ever seen.&&&1

Democratic outsource attack alienating Indian American vote bank&&&Americans do have a good disposable income and thus have one of the highest standards of living in the world. Let us suppose an American earns US$2000 to $3000 monthly. Few Americans can or will work for less than US$7/hour. It is almost impossible to survive if you work for less than US$7/hour. They can still have the highest standard of living in the world. How come? The reason why they can have the highest standard of living is because they can buy inexpensive goods from developing nations. Let's take the case of tennis shoes. Please make a trip to shoe retail outlets or for that matter textile or electronics retail outlets. Check it out. There are very few USA made tennis shoes in the retail stores in USA. You can buy tennis shoes made in China for as little as US$25. If the same shoe is made in USA, it would cost probably US$150-US$300. This the price Americans have to pay if they insist on buying only USA made goods. What does it mean if all the goods on display in retail stores are made in USA: it means that almost all prices of the goods on display in retail stores have to be multiplied by 5 or 10. It is impossible. How are Americans going to feed their families earning US$2000 to US$3000 a month. It's impossible. The only way out is to import cheap goods from developing nations. It is these cheap imports that give Americans the good life. Right now, right next to me is a shirt that is made in Vietnam. Please do me a favor if you are an American. Please remove your clothes and check to find out where your underwear, your shirt, pants, bra, skirt, etc are made in. You�d be surprised by how unknowingly you are supportive of cheap imports. Please do me another favor if you are American. Please check your office and household goods. Gosh! Unknowingly Americans have been so supportive of cheap imports. It does not really matter as long as it continues to give Americans the good life. If Americans insist on stopping outsourcing and buying only USA made goods, then they must be willing to pay the price; and the price would be that the current retail prices in USA must be multiplied by 5 to 10. I�m not kidding. What�s the difference? The difference is that Americans are unwilling to work for less than US$7/hour. In third world nations there a people who can feed their families by earning US$1 or US$2 a day. If Americans want to continue to keep the highest standard of living in the world, they have to continue to import cheap goods from third world nations. The free trade and free market economy is still the best.&&&7

The US is selling more jets to their arabic allies for the eventual conflict with iran, somehow I don't see Israel so badly out numbered with this going on... It has occurred to me that if the west keeps an on going never ending conflict in syria, they can bypass a plagued assad and move onto to their iran agenda with less difficulty.

Wei Liu: My Life in China 1.1: 180 Square Feet Home&&&The Series Books of My Life in China Wei Liu April 2013 Foreword Common people write memoir or autobiography too. As a common person lived in China, when I write it, some people around me say,�You are not celebrity. Who will read your autobiography?� If someone says to them,�You are just inferior,� they must feel so incensed, but in their heart, don�t they just regard themselves as inferior? I believe in that all people are equal to each other. And my autobiography writing about the ups and downs of common people, with the grand political and economic events that affect people�s life, which will appeal to common people more than books not focused on therein. Literature, by the norm of whether its scenes actually happened or not, is divided into two big categories: non-fiction and fiction. Non-fiction including autobiography, memoir, and other writings on things happened. Fiction is novel. Prose is an unclear category and should be cancelled. So literature is not just novel. Someone says,�This year I read 40 novels.� Are all the 40 books imagined scenarios?� Outside the Window by the Taiwan writer Yao Qiong is her autobiography, nonfiction, not fiction, not novel. If the reader cannot tell whether a work is happened or imagined, he may just say,�This year I read 40 literary works.� Anyway, the series books of My Life in China is my, Wei Liu�s memoir, autobiography, and of course belong to nonfiction. It is not quite possible to require anything to be 100%. There is hardly 100% consent or 100% against. Let�s use 50% as the demarcation. Over 50% or mostly consent is consent; over 50% or mostly against is against. The same, if over 50% of the words in a work actually happened, then it is nonfiction; if over 50% of the words in a work is imagined, then it is fiction, which is usually called novel. In this book series, except myself, other people around me are only mentioned by their last name, not their first name. They know who they are. My words depict the life of me, as a common person in China and render the solution for the 1.3 billion Chinese people to free ourselves from the hardships and oppressions and to finally have a happy life. Everybody is welcome to spread or publish my writings. Once you do not charge the reader, you don�t need to pay me, the author, anything. According to the international convention, the works educating or serving the public, like the book series of My Life in China may cite other works and are not confined by the copyright. Wish all who consent the ideas of the human rights and democracy, spread these ideas to one or more people every month, to save yourself, to save China, to let the world have more peace and happiness. The end of the foreword. The rest see the reply.&&&4
Russian warships set sail to Mediterranean amid possible Syria evacuation&&&Is all modern war a staged managed event, I believe so, missile technology will make everyone equal, so warfare must become what it is now, a grab for credibility with regard to public opinion in the wealthy countries.

I always asserted the vibrant future was communism because it was Allah's ambition, and had planning and population control (utilitarian philosophy), no one listened to me. In fact my being was usurped and alien opinion attached to it as an expectation of what it would become after a life time of misery. The future we had, the one our forbear left simply vanished, and so did Allah's ambition.&&&3601

CBS: FBI questioned Tamerlan Tsarnaev two years ago&&&The truth will never be known. the entire situation is bizarre.Everything was in their favor. how did the younger brother get citizenship so quickly?

The FBI interviewed one of them two years earlier and found nothing derogatory. Russia contacted the FBI and requested the invetigation.The family knows lots and russia knows lots.I believe the boys knew very little.Where did tamerlan get fund to purchase a mercedes suv. He owned one.The father lives in russia. where does the mother live?The investigators must handle this kid very delicately and probe thoroughly. It will be difficult to get info from him. information will come from him in bits and pieces.They will have to put together a tough jigsaw by listening carefully to each word he says.Why did russia not detain and question tamerlan in 2013 when he was there for 6 months.&&&2

Opposition in Cuba bangs pots and pans in solidarity with Venezuela's opposition&&&How many people demonstrated by this measure, 10, 20, 50, 100? Surely there are no more than that ,on the whole island who are so foolish as to (in effect), bite the hand that feeds them,(free oil for their electrical power generation). These protesters care not a fig for other people! Just so they can clean the rust off some of their old pots and pans and not care a rats ass, about the people who aren't out there, and are quietly working hard, to help their country move forward. If you want to protest something, calmly speak to the person(s) who CAN make change possible. Don't gather like a pack of dogs barking and whining. Remember, an empty wagon makes the most noise! You protesters are just taunting the Government officials and making them mad, instead of having calm, meaningful, logical discussions with the people who CAN make the changes you would like. These things take time, my friends. Raul knows this, and I'm sure that he has many, many, changes, that can only be released slowly and steadily, for the good of ALL CUBANS!&&&15

These Tunisian women are upcessed with the dirty politics. I wish they find something else to occupying themselves rather than destroying the culture and the respect of our family life. The problem in Tunisia now is these two foreign business women one is American are 1.Linda Thomes and her British lasbien partner ,,Kathy Gest , they are funding the Tunisian women organisation with substantial amount of money and have so many meetings within the polics in 5 part's of Tunisian Cities, therefore to prepare them selfs for the future comming election. I believe the Tunisian government should take action now before too late, these women should be sorted out immediately to stop any further agrivation may spread in tha whol of Tunisia.

Propping up those who would attack us, giving no bid contracts to his friends, taking lavish vacations, and lying to the American people. He's spent his days bashing America while ignoring Russia's warning that the bombers had radical ties. Obama has blood on his hands. He needs to do the right thing and resign. If he won't do it, Congress should impeach. Otherwise, they're abetting in criminal behavior and are therefore just as guilty for the Boston Bombings as Obama.&&&2

Congress should stop meddling and let Postal Service run itself&&&First of all the problems with the USPS were not started by the U.S. Government, but by local government and the main and number one culprit is the 911 addressing authorities there. If you are told that you can not deliver a letter or article to an address because the local officials claim that it does not exist because it is not a part of their addressing system and even though you know the address and everything else about the addressee. The local authorities are refusing to allow the delivery of the item to it's address because it is not a 911 address that they issued. That is what we call interferring with the delivery of the mail. And if they are not interferring with the delivery of the mail then they are making an attempt at regulating speech, both of which are crimes. But then there are the other aspects of this problem such as violating a federally protected contract, fraud, attempted fraud, tampering with Private communications, and the list goes on and on. The problems that the U.S.P.S. are having are strictly due to the local government and not with the federal government except the federal government does not seem to be enforcing the laws. If you want to destroy a country then the best way to do that is to disrupt their communications networks. And the local county governments accross this country have done just that with the way that they implemented 911 addressing. The economy went to hell and so did the safety of this country at the same time. The housing industry, and banking industry and everyone else that received a government bailout from the tax payer's were with us all the time, but the one thing that did change was addressing and that is what got this so-called recession going and the funny part is that the people who can stop the problem think that the only solution for them now is to let it go, and the problem with that is that it will not stop until the addressing problem is corrected, because of the many breaches in the public trust that occured and are still occuring. Rural America does take things very personal and they do not forget. And trying to enforce these improper actions by force only makes the situation worse. World War I and II were won because the people were with the government. If the people are not a partner, but are being made slaves of a system. Then the system is doomed. The federal government should just delivery a persons mail and not waste money and time trying to determine if a persons address is acceptable.&&&10

Back-Alley Abortion Never Ended&&&Gosnell was coddled by other abortionists and protected by a pro-abort governor. There's ample proof that the back alley is mainstream among the abortion-supporting death cultists. "... The advent of "safe, legal abortion" didn't interfere with Gosnell's back-alley career. The grand jury's account suggests that other abortionists treated him less as an outlaw than as a niche player in the abortion market. He earned a bad reputation in Philadelphia but received referrals from across the Eastern Seaboard. Many of the women dispatched to him were "well beyond" 24 weeks pregnant, the legal limit in Pennsylvania. "Gosnell was known as a doctor who would perform abortions at any stage, without regard for legal limits," the grand jury reported. "His patients came from several states, including Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, as well as from Pennsylvania cities outside the Philadelphia area, such as Allentown. He also had many late-term Philadelphia patients because most other local clinics would not perform procedures past 20 weeks." The woman Gosnell is accused of murdering with a drug overdose, 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, came from Virginia and was referred by a clinic either there or in the District of Columbia. [...] "Why were these horrors allowed to persist for decades? Even if the infanticides had been concealed, there were ample other irregularities in the clinic's operations, including filth, unsanitized instruments, unqualified staff and dangerously inappropriate use of drugs. When the clinic was finally raided in 2010, it was the result of a federal narcotics investigation. "Part of the reason for the regulatory failure was simple bureaucratic indifference or incompetence. Inspectors from the Pennsylvania Department of Health visited several times between 1979 and 1993, noted problems, and didn't bother following up. But after 1993, the inspectors never reappeared until the 2010 raid. The reason was political. In 1994 Tom Ridge, a pro-abortion Republican, was elected governor, succeeding the antiabortion Democrat Bob Casey. According to the grand jury, Ridge administration officials "concluded that inspections would be 'putting a barrier up to women' seeking abortions. Better to leave clinics to do as they pleased." The new policy did away with all regular inspections of abortion clinics. Mr. Ridge's lassitudinous approach was bipartisan, continued by his successor, Democrat Ed Rendell, who resumed the inspections only after the 2010 raid."&&&1

McCain backs gun compromise&&&Where is the compromise? It sounds like the Democrats are getting exactly what they want and only a few liberal Republicans like John McCain are willing to support it. A compromise would be allowing people to privately sell guns between states and repealing provisions of the the Gun Control Act of 1968 as long as they had proof of passing a background check. Cards could be issued to people who can pass a background check so there isn't a need to basically track all firearm purchases through gun dealers. That is going to create a de facto gun registration scheme and is absurd.&&&26

Explosions, algae blooms, global warming. Why do we need so much ammonium nitrate again?&&&The problem is NOT ammonium nitrate. Some changes in the regulations are probably necessary but nitrogen fertilizer is necessary to feed the planet (a high protein, aka meat diet). 1: Exclusion (buffer) zone around any major plant. Residential housing should NEVER be allowed to be built around ANY dangerous plant. i.e. toxic or explosive products. 2: Let it burn. Evacuate and let the thing blow. It was a bad idea to fight the fire when it was so far out of control. The fire chief should have called for an evacuation to save lives, rather than fight the fire to save money. But I guess a volunteer fire department doesn't understand the risks so well. Better training should be in place for volunteer fire fighting around such plants. 3: biochar and low till can reduce fertilizer runoff. It might even be possible to compound the nitrogen fertilizer into something less soluable that will not dissolve or wash out in sudden rainfall. Some common sense solutions to what is a non-problem.&&&2

Immigration sophistry&&&" Republican Sen.

Sure it does Senator, it gives or sells our American citizenship to 11 million illegal aliens that broke our Immigration Laws to get here! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX It's sad when some politicians and segments of our population want to degrade our American Citizenship to the point where it has no value or meaning. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX "This amnesty will give citizenship to only 1.1 to 1.3 million illegal aliens. We will secure the borders henceforth.

McCain: Immigration law wouldn't negate Ariz. law&&&So Garcia believes 70% of illegals in Arizona will be legalized??? That guy is not facing reality. The new immigration reform bill will sweep thousands out and they're already heading to Utah. Mike Lee mentioned today in the hearings, this 844 page bill cannot be crammed down our throat's. We need time to look and understand the entire bill. The Nationals that came here from Russia, are an example of why, they can't just allow illegals from everywhere to come here.No more asylam for individuals that have serious political problems in there own Country's as did these two crackpot's.

Why Rand Paul Ignored the Southern Strategy at Howard University&&&Becausr the Republicans never had a Southern Strategy. That is nothing more than a myth created by the Corporate Fascist Media. However, the dems used the Southen Stategy all the time.

Ludicrous,onsidering that George Wallace ran as third party and carried the deep south. 1972 Nixon carries 49 out of 50 states 1976 Dems use Southern Stategy, push Carter; Corporate Fascis Mdia covers-up Carter's attendance of White Supremist Church. 1980 Reagan, Universal Support 1984 Reagan, Universal Support 1988 Bush Sr., Bailed Out by Reagan 1992 Dems use Southern Strategy-Clinton/Gore; 2 Southerners 1996 Dems use Southern Strategy Again Clinton/Gore 2000 Dems again use Southern Strategy; Gore ----------&&&3
Fertilizer Plant Explosion&&&I believe we are being deceived by our government once more. There has been no mention of the disaster in Texas on any news channels including CNN, and FNC since the day after the explosion. I believe the media has been told to keep quiet on this subject. Why? Because many government agencies,(local & Federal) screwed up. The EPA stated that the plant posed no threat of fire or explosion to the nearby neighborhood or school. Tell that to the families that no longer have a home to live in and/or are grieving the loss of a loved one. The O'Bama Administration does not want yet another failure attributed to them, so they are telling the media to "play up" the coverage on the Marathon Bombing. Yes, what happened and is happening in Boston is a tragedy, but does it really warrant interrupting local programming to show us the police going door to door in Watertown, or to speculate on the reasoning behind the attacks? The American people have a right to know exactly how the local and Federal agencies allowed a school and neighborhood to be built so close to a plant that stores highly explosive chemicals!&&&1

Who are these Terrorists in Boston&&&What the media will try to soften: They are Islamic extremists from Chechnya, they are not Russian. Less than 1% of Chechens are of Russian decent. These same people support the ideology of killing unarmed women and children. They believe in a world where men should kill those who cannot fight back, and run like heck when the real trained soldiers arrive. They are basically child abusers and women beaters who thrive on such actions, believing that their religious beliefs give them impunity, thus fueling their passions. The question americans should be asking is "what do their families think about their actions?" The father, who was interviewed this morning from Grozny stated that his son is an angel and vows violence against any parent, child, cop, soldier, etc, who might take his son's life.

Kerri proved that he is delusional pacifist that will not deal with the major danger to the American people from the Iranian-Syrian-Russian-North Korean axis of evil and their nukes and nuke warheads mounted on Ballistic missiles and WMDs in the hands of al Qaida and Hezbollah. Kerri is trying to push 'Jewish Land in return for peace' with Hamas and PLO terrorists including freezing the building of Jewish houses in Jerusalem while allowing building of only Mozlem Brother Houses for the terrorists will not happen. Israel under threat of nukes from Iran, and Chemical WMDs from Syria and Lebanon will not trust Obama to protect Jews from Iranian nukes and Syrian WMDs when America is slashing its US Military. Obama will fail to force Israel back to suicidal defenseless 6 miles width borders of 1967 and PM Netanyahu will not sacrifice the lives of 6 million Jews for failed Kerri peace games with Mozlem Brother Terrorists when Obama fails to deal with Iranian-North Korean-Syrian axis against America and Israel.&&&1

ATF says it never sought Missouri concealed guns list&&&Governor Jay Nixon, D-Missouri, that lying sack of sh%t, saying that the state's dept. of Revenue, never sent records to a federal agency and then MO state highway patrol head confirmed that they did, how much corruption do we have to put up with. We have had going on 5 years of corruption enough is enough. Then the Director of Revenue, Brian Long resigns, for no reason, just because he likes to be unemployed, to collect those federal unemployment benefits. I say Missourians, we need to stop the corruption, 5 state agencies, are being directed by people that jay nixon have insisted they look away when corruption is being done, they are dept. of revenue, dept. of social services, family support division, child support enforcement & dept. of corrections. They stated when former republican president George Bush, son was in office, Democrats said, he was never accountable for his actions/role in the Iraq war, but it seems to me republicans want corruption out of politics, while the democrats embrace it as the norms, Nixon's administration sees it as the process of doing the state's business. Let's stop this. If they stop the corruption at the government level, be honest and open, then you will see situations like this will decrease and you will see the culture change.&&&1

Royal Malaysian Navy Gowind class Corvettes for LCS program to be fitted with stealth 57mm Guns&&&hmmmmm..... quote menarik dari artikel, ---------- 1."The 57mm Mk 3 naval gun with stealth cupola is already fitted on the Royal Swedish Navy Visby class stealth corvettes. Like on the Visby class, the stealth cupola will greatly contribute to lower the stealth signature of the Malaysian Gowind corvettes. An engineer from BHIC Bofors Asia SDN. BHD. told us during LIMA 2013 that the shape of the stealth cupola for the Gowind Corvettes will slightly differ from the one found on the Visby class to maximize the stealth characteristics of the corvette designed by DCNS." 2."It was confirmed during LIMA that the combat management system will be the SETIS by DCNS, the Fire Control Systems will be provided by Rheinmetall, and the engines will be provided by MTU. The design seems to have increased in size with the length of the LCS now at 111 meters (compared to 107 as previously reported) with a displacement of about 3,000 tons (compared to full load displacement of 2,730 tonnes as previously announced). Integrated with SETIS, a combat system derived from FREMM class Frigates, Gowind Combat can tackle air, surface and submarine threats. The shock-resistant platform (built according to military standards), the small radar cross-section together with an excellent acoustic signature makes it a high-performance surface combatant. Gowind Combat can be operated by a limited crew and has been designed to offer great at-sea availability and reduced life cycle costs. " ---------- :-)&&&34
White House: Obama 'Deeply Committed' To Diverse Cabinet&&&Obama is deeply committed to diversity because he is campaigning for the 2014 election and every Black, Hispanic and Asian vote counts. Obama is in full election campaign mode and in reckless mode of 'spend today on votes and forget about tomorrow' since his election in 2009 as Obama needs more money to buy votes of 30 million more Americans with free food stamps, Obama phone and free healthcare to defeat GOP in the 2014 elections. On the other hand GOP Congress is worrying about the destruction of America from bankruptcy, they offer cuts in the budget while they do not think it will hurt then in 2014 elections. Evidently, more than half of the Americans getting free Obama check every month for the rest of their lives cannot care less about the fall of America to bankruptcy as long as Obama keep sending them money that he cuts from the US Military and making it the most dysfunctional military in US history. Harry Reid is a despicable and disgraceful mentally sick liberal who will spend every trillion dollar that he can still get from China and Saudi Arabia and use it to buy votes of the more than 30 million parasites of the Blacks, Hispanic and Asians that do not want to work and will vote for Obama in 2014 in return for food stamps for lifetime.&&&2

PAMAM used for inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs)&&&Poly(amido amine) (PAMAM, generation 2, CY Dendrimer Technology Co., Ltd), a solution-processable dendrimer, is used as the electron-collection interlayer on indium tin oxide (ITO) for inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester as the active materials. The inverted PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 3.53% under AM1.5G illumination, which is significantly higher than that of the control inverted PSCs with blank ITO and comparable to that of the control PSCs with normal architecture. The high-performance of the inverted PSCs is attributed to the reduction of the work function of ITO by 0.75 eV by PAMAM. (Highly efficient inverted polymer solar cells with a solution-processable dendrimer as the electron-collection interlayer, Vajjiravel Murugesan, American,Appl. Phys. Lett. 102, 083302 ,2013)&&&1
Congress Takes on Postal Service Reform-Again&&&They need to stop playing games with addresses. Their computers can hold more than one address for the same location. Quit playing games with the people at 911 addressing and ask the patrons for their address and street name. Put the government in their place and get their noses out of the delivery of the mail. This goes for the government too. Stop playing games with the 911 officials and let them know that they are not only breaking the law but destroying our economy. IGNORING AN OLD ADDRESS IN FAVOR OF A NEW ONE IS STILL INTERFERING WITH THE DELIVERY OF THE MAIL. aND SENDING MAIL BACK TO THE SENDER DOUBLES THE COST OF HANDLING THE MAIL. And leads people to believe that the government can not do anything if they can not do something as simple as delivering the mail. The more modern it seems that we become the less stuff we seem to be able to get done. Congress needs to make them deliver the mail to any address known to a location including addresses other than 911 addresses.&&&1

The top money handlers of this state have taken full advantage of all the prisoner's disadvantages in today's society. In this day and age, you have corruption in every place you can think of. It won't be long now before the Feds soon find out just how high up that corruption ladder stands. From the typical corrections officer all the way up to the governor of the state. The men and women who run this state and who have taken advantage of the prison system for their own financial gain, are pathetic. Makes you wonder why it's failing.&&&1

Interracial relationships, good or bad ?&&&I personally don't mind but I wouldn't want someone in my family to marry someone who was black.

Senator Mocked On Floor For Gun Conspiracy&&&Big NY Liberal Socialist Schumer who follows Obama's agenda blindly proved to act like a miserable clown of the Senate that rejected Schumer demand for 'Gun registry' under Obama control and pushing the control by Obama of 300 million guns owned by the American people for more than 236 years. Obama was defeated for his efforts to 're-invent the wheel' about existing laws that prevent selling guns to criminals . Clearly, the new water-down Federal background checks aimed at increasing Obama's control on our private life and create hurdles to good, honest, law abiding Americans that deserve self-defense at their homes where Obama and local police cannot provide adequate security. The American people were not convinced that new intervention of Obama in Americans private life will prevent madmen and evil people from using guns of the 300 million guns that American people already purchased according to the laws. The socialistic dictator Obama and his arrogant supporter Mike Bloomberg failed to further cut the right f every American according to the US Constitution that they seek to trash.&&&2

Interview: Will the Bo Xilai Case Change China?&&&Cynical thieving bandit warlords populate the Chinese Communist Party from top to bottom. Check this out: "Bo Xilai made a name for himself for advancing so-called "leftist" politics; that is, a return to a more state-centric model for China's development. What did this have to do with his downfall? First of all, I want to correct the common perception among Westerners that the Bo Xilai case was a battle between the good and the evil, or a conflict between Maoist radicals and moderate reformists. My co-author and I don't believe that Bo actually cared about the Maoist tradition; he simply saw it as an avenue to gain popular support by appealing directly to the people. It was, simply, another brand of politics. Bo was able to capitalize on a general trend toward state involvement in the economy, launched by Hu Jintao, as well as general public anger about income inequality and rampant corruption. I don't believe for a minute Bo believed in what he was doing, and neither did Premier Wen Jiabao with his so-called "liberal" ideas, really. I mean, Bo sent his son to Harvard to study political science while encouraging Chongqing's population to study Maoism. Wen Jiabao espoused liberal democratic reforms, but no political reforms was implemented under his rule. He advocated a clean government while his family was making millions of dollars through their political connections. Ultimately, there aren't really any liberals in the Chinese political system. Everything boils down to personal interests, and no matter what they say, none of the Chinese leaders want political reform so long as they're in power. They look at what happened with the Arab Spring, with Hosni Mubarak, all the score settling, and they fear that they're going to end up in jail."&&&2

What's Behind the Russian Adoption Ban?&&&Personally I don't think that Americans should feel like they have a "right" or that they are "entitled" to everything and anything in the world. I agree 100% of the ban even though I'm an American. I think that way too many Americans would make bad parents and are dangerous people. Heck if I had children of my own I would actually leave the country. I also don't agree with the US News Propaganda that the Russians are doing this simply because they are mad at the US for Political reasons. Statistics show that Americans are very violent, aggressive, under educated, and are poor workers. A lot of Americans are dead beat and/or abusive parents. Also with past adoptions by US parents from Russia has shown time and time again that there is abuse (in some cases death) of the children, abandonment, and other issues. Most Americans want to almost "buy" or "purchase" a child so they can look cool to their neighbors or friends. Sort of like when Liberal Parents adopt an African Baby. But they are doing it for the wrong reasons and they get pissed off when they realize that this is a child and not a toy or a car. Americans make inferior parents.&&&8

The Super Bowl (Copyright 2010 by Patricia McGurk Martin)&&&I am including a poem I wrote the last version of in August 2010 about torture or violence against an American writer (a woman) in the Superbowl Half-Time period as "crowd entertainment" while she is in a hypnosis trance and held hostage before the huge crowd. I do this to prevent further crimes against me as an intellectual and writer, also a beautiful woman who refuses to be degraded again in this horrifying format - as crime prevention I publish my poem again: The Super Bowl Poetry By: Patricia McGurk Martin Poetry Tags: Torture, Murder, Hypnosis, Trance, Degradation, Woman, Child, Beauty, Nazis THE SUPER BOWL by � 2010 Patricia McGurk Martin I stand up to clear my name of any lies while defining the murder assaults I have faced in the United States, a country I once loved. These assaults have been public all along, and I suffered in the darkness hypnotized in trances - unable to protect myself since childhood. They murder you through the vagina, the bottom and your soul. They kill you as the dietician taking your child�s canteen and wild strawberries as you wait for the semen to drop on your face as a woman who once was a child, also waiting � for dry air out of the raining waterfall while huge crowds applaud you as you read poems you have not written yet while tied up, half-dressed and suffering in public bondage a beautiful woman stuttering in fear or just the flat terrifying death tones of a trance the breath is caught in your chest painfully squeezed tight in a cold frozen trance you are in the very back unable to speak as your throat won�t move, let alone your tongue the Ritual Murder takes place in present seconds � not yesterday, as they told the countless stiff blank people, the large audience, that you had Already Died and were reading from the grave � your final poems Reading as You they said your final poems were being read as You, they the torturers said I whisper I tell my Mother everything I tell myself I will speak at the End as me to Me My words have meaning I say quietly my words become Myself Me � Are � Me � They ARE ME MY WORDS I realize I am Me I am the Only Person in the World I Am Alone Not Lonely as I Speak as Me. The Essential I with self actualization As the Crowds Behind Me Roared in the Super Bowl I no longer want to prove my Big Light � my Crime Spotlight � is my copyright or my wild strawberries of childhood are Mine The atrocities are over against Me in My Life.

Immigration measure's opponents hope delays will kill bipartisan bill&&&OVER 261,000 PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED IT! PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION AGAINST AN AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS AND IT WILL BE FAXED IMMEDIATELY TO ALL OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES FOR FREE! WHY SIGNING THIS PETITION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS! The reason is that signing this petition puts a person into an email system at NumbersUSA that will alert them every time one of their elected officials needs to hear something specific about immigration. Nobody else but NumbersUSA runs a customized grassroots mobilization system likethis that constantly gathers information on Capitol Hill about your Members of Congress and then lets you know what they are doing, saying and thinking about immigration policy. The New York Times and other mass media have repeatedly stated that NumbersUSA's mobilization network led the efforts that defeated the close-call amnesty efforts of 2007 and 2010. But the forces for open borders are far more powerful today. Please help by passing along this Petition to everybody you know.&&&5

Poll: What Do You Think of Obamacare Decision?&&&in my opinion Obamacare is a very good improvement for the US. I can't stand why are people against it. Let them break their legs or even worst then most of them have to sell alot of their properties to even pay the hospital bill. And for the who people are able to pay that bill. you got money so what's the matter...&&&28
Planned Parenthood Leader Condemned Horrific Abortion Allegations Against Gosnell - But&&&Planned Parenthood profits by ending the lives of the unborn. No morals, stained souls for sure. Hypocrites. Ladies in need of medical care, there are numerous facilities that do not perform abortions that will care for you. Don't be fooled by their "we care about women" b.s.&&&1
Most Florida Voters Support 'Stand Your Ground' Law: Poll&&&Good! I support Stand Your Ground too. In Zimmerman's case he may have gone too far, but if he pursued Trayvon, then Stand Your Ground no longer applies. So many vicious hate crimes are done by black thugs against innocent whites. In Hawaii Polynesian roughnecks sometimes threaten or harass "haoles" as whites are called. They even have a tradition called "Kill Haole Friday" or something. Where is the outrage about all of that, hmm? The wheel has come full circle, and today hypocrisy and injustice are being inflicted against whites instead of by them. Past wrongs are being used to rationalize persecuting an innocent generation for being related to the enemy. In principle, this is exactly what was done to Japanese-Americans in the internment episode.&&&3

Obama's generational politics&&&People assume Nazis were right wing conservatives. The media bashes Libertarians every day with this kind of stuff. Not true, the Nazi party -National Socialist German Workers' Party- were radical leftist socialists engaging in eugenics like the corrupt criminals we have running the foreign banker owned federal government today. They believed anyone that was not genetic perfection should be terminated. If you were old, had medical problems, or were a little slow at childhood you were not fit to live or get any medical help when needed. And yes,they had end of life death pannels for elderly and many others. That sounds like Obamacare to me. Ask Canadians or Brits how they like their radical socialist health care. That's why they often came to the US for medical treatments. States need to opt out. Looking now how broad it is, Obamacare was a covert dismantling and re-write of our constitution. It opens the door to pure tyranny.&&&32

Gun control bill in peril&&&I said after the Newtown massacre that "no new laws will come to pass". Everyone told me this time was different......everyone except people who have knowledge of our Constitution, that is! You see we already have back ground checks. We already have laws against murder. And we have a big old law that says it's a federal crime to attempt to infringe upon a law abiding citizen's right to bear arms. End of story. Guns are here to stay.&&&1

"May explain why your job moved to (hash)China!" Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Dan Logsdon said the comments were "deplorable" and "have absolutely no place" in Kentucky politics. Deplorable?

Rand Paul's Insulting Bait and Switch to African-American Voters&&&"If the answers not obvious to you, there's another bit of history that can help clear it up. Starting in the 1940s and accelerating in the 1960s national Democratic attitudes about segregation moved to the left, while the attitudes of the southern conservatives who had long affiliated with the Democratic Party pushed further to the right. This created an untenable intraparty tension that couldn't last forever. And it didn't, because southern conservatives found a new, more comfortable party to call home, one that expressed values in sync with their own. It was the Republican Party. They switched to it in droves." interesting piece of history. i have heard folk on here complaining about how blk americans support the democratic party (is it any of there business) when the dems have a "past" history of being in cohust with racist ideologies. i wonder what they have to say about this historical information.&&&8

Anthony Weiner releases plan for New York City&&&What a putz ! MOST politicians are attorneys. And because of that, once their political career is over (willingly or unwillingly), there are a number of things they can do, including, but not limited to: opening their own law firm; joing an existing law firm; become a registered lobbyist; become a teacher (those who can, DO; those who can't, TEACH). This D*CK doesn't have a law degree, he only has a B.A. which about 250 million Americans also have (such as myself). And he hasn't held a job since he quit congress. This idiot is a LOSER. And it's worth noting that his mentor, Chuck Schumer, also a Jew, has not endorsed him for mayor, nor anything else. MY SUGGESTION: 1. Go back to school and earn a masters degree or a doctrate degree. 2. Change your name. 3. Seek an honest job where you really have to work, and make sure it's TOTALLY UNRELATED to politics. Otherwise, it looks likely that your wife will be supporting you financially for the rest of your life. AND COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A WIFE, because 99% of the wives out there would DUMP their husbands for doing what you did. She must be ONE SPECIAL LADY to put up with the likes of you. You're a MOOK !&&&5

I hope you murdering gun lovers can sleep at night knowing all the pain you cause with these evil instruments of death. You all need a hobby of some sort. And don't quote me Supreme Court mumbojumbo! Or Thomas Jefferson or R. Lee Ermery from Full Metal Jacket. Or Ted Nugent lyrics!! I'm going insain with all the bullets flying around. I haven't even been outside this year yet! Heaven help us!&&&9
Medicare increase could ding some in middle class&&&The middle class will be stuck with the entire bill for this and all other increases in taxes since they are where the bulk of the money is. Taxing the rich won't amount to a hill of beans overall but liberals seem to think so. What this is all becoming is a HUGE redistribution of wealth, not from the rich but from anyone who has anything so they can support those who cannot or will not. That is where all roads lead. Medicare and Obamacare are just the tip of the iceberg.&&&1
Boston tragedy delays immigration bill&&&Did the terrorists that hit Boston came to America by crossing the border or by overstaying their visas? Obama vowed to welcome the 11 million terrorists and non-terrorists in America with �Amnesty to all� and with free food stamps and free Obama phone that shows his greatness. Obama vowed to and bring the al Qaida terrorists that killed four Americans in Benghazi but he obviously still investigating why the Jihadist terrorists of al Qaida hate America after the killing of Bin laden. Did the American people ever had any enemies around the world that ever vowed to kill Americans in America or elsewhere or are they loved by the al Qaida, Taliban and other Mozlem brother terrorists? Did the al Qaida terrorists vowed to kill Americans and revenge the killing of Osama Bin Laden? Did the IED roadside style bombs that exploded in Boston and killed innocent child and women while being filled with balls bearings and pins as to kill as many people as possible were ever used by the Jihadist terrorists of al Qaida and the Taliban in the Middle East as typical Mozlem Brother attack on innocent Americans? Clearly, Obama will take months to investigate and investigate why would anyone ever try to kill Americans in a world that loves America as he still did not finalize the investigation of al Qaida attack on US Embassy in Benghazi after more than 6 months that helped his re-election. Mozlem Brother Morsi rushed to say "It's not me" since his support the al Qaida terrorists in Northern Africa and Hamas terrorists of Gaza that were behind the Benghazi attack.&&&1
In White House, Newtown mom pleads for gun control&&&... TARGET -LAW ABIDING CITIZENS Mexican children murdered by guns from Obama's "Fast and Furious" program Since the Left decided to politicize the Sandy Hook school shooting; perhaps they would like to address Obama's "fast and furious" program? Since we are talking about gun violence and gun control; perhaps the Left should recognize how guns from Obama's "fast and furious" program has resulted in the murders of Mexican school children? ---------- On January 30, 2010, according to the Univision report, hired hit men working for the Mexican cartel La Linea invaded a house and opened fire on nearly 60 teenagers who had gathered there for a birthday party. More shootings occurred outside against neighbors and fleeing students. Univision reported that three of the high-caliber weapons used by the hit men were linked to Operation Fast and Furious. This massacre does not appear to be an isolated incident. There is a disturbing pattern in which the ATF lost track of weapons provided to Mexican drug cartels via straw purchasers, some of which later ended up at crime scenes in Mexico. In other words, it allowed suspects to walk away with illegally purchased guns in order to try and catch bigger fish. But the big fish got away as well after using the guns to kill their prey. ALSO MOMS PLEAD FOR THESE MEXICAN CHILDREN ALSO!!!!&&&3

JUSTICE If we every want to prove to the world that we've see the error of our ways, all we have to do is: Let Iraq and Afghan forces invade our Republican Midwest and South, let them murder over 100,000 men, women and children (including the UNBORN!), destroy homes and businesses, devastate the economies of those states, and never stop doing house to house searches for guns. THEN, after a decade of that, there will be justice, as the warmongers get a taste of the evil they do to the rest of the world.

CBS: corrupt LAPD and Ca.&&&CBS link, next post. This story is NOT unusual because victims keep quiet. That cowardice guarantees that the corruption will increase. This can happen to ANY OF US and we're dumping it on our CHILDREN! Parents who aren't fighting back are child abusers. This man was falsely convicted of murdering his mother by a corrupt LAPD detective, and when another detective tried to find the truth decades later, his supervisor told him to bury the truth to protect the corruption. In the end, the good guy was punished, and the detective who should have been prosecuted got to retire. The man who was falsely convicted was set free, but not until many YEARS after the truth was exposed, and later CA state tried to have the innocent guy put back in prison because of a technicality. THERE ARE MORE OF US THAT THERE ARE OF THEM! WE ARE THE MONEY BEHIND THE CORRUPTION, SO WE ARE THE POWER BEHIND IT! The corruption exists only because so many people want to be pathetic losers, and the others are too afraid. So, WE HAVE NO EXCUSE. Also, OREGON SHOWS CALIFORNIA HOW IT'S DONE. California's legal system is so corrupt that lawyers like Bangerter get away with hundreds of felonies, while Oregon goes after those legal parasites. Oregon just put McGavic (who was hired by Bangerter who worked to profit from his crimes) out of business, fined him, and took his license to practice law.&&&4

Nuclear Bombshell: North Korea has Nukes Capable of Striking Neighboring Nations, Says Pentagon&&&when all this snafu began I told my wife "of course they have nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them." Two missle tests to see where they would reach with the thought of mounting a nuke warhead atop a missle and sending it on its way. The Pentagon says they have the means but not the accuracy. Who gives a shit about accuracy when they can just lob a bomb over a populated area. Read about ground bursts and air bursts. Which one would take out the most lives. Also read that when the bomb goes off, it generates temperatures in the several million degree range, enough to vaporize plants, and human life! And that is just the heat wave, then you get the blast effects and the vacuum phase where everything is sucked back into the rising mushroom cloud. Over the next several days you will have radioactive dust falling on everything. Just a matter of time when people contract leukemia and start dying off.

Honolulu Lite: Obama newest "I Hate Mayo Club" Member&&&I thought of a simple way to prove to anyone how disgusting mayonnaise really is. Ask anybody what the best meal they ever had was, and it's a guarantee that meal had nothing to do with mayonnaise in any shape or form. Mayonnaise is always associated with trashy food. Would anybody in their right mind put mayonnaise on a $50 steak? No way! Why not? It would ruin the flavor. Then why do people eat mayonnaise at all? Because it's just there, and people have been force-fed it their entire lives. Companies even try to hide it in things like honey mustard, which shouldn't be anything but honey and mustard. Why do they hide it? It's the food industry's equivalent to brain-washing.&&&31
Rick Perry to Gun Manufacturer Leaving Connecticut Over New Gun Law: 'Come on Down!'&&&Is pandering simpering and anti-civil rights anti jobs crusader Ct Gov Malloy acting just like a two faced deceitful hypocrite?(After all guns are the original civil right). Well, according to the Courant Newspaper he pulled political favors and handed out political bribes to keep his felon criminal son from doing any prison time, and the son is walking around free on probation. The son perpetrated an armed home invasion (his son took a plea reduced down to 1st degree felony attempted robbery of his drug dealer using a pellet pistol he threatened his victim with as being a firearm, plus a plea to a drug felony ). Look it up. So we do know that Malloy thinks that a violent felon should not face any consequences and should walk around free if part of the Malloy family. But if a regular citizen with a state permit to carry pistols and spotless record happens to own a handgun purchased totally legally last year, but which Molloy thinks now just holds too many evil cartridges, and if they fail to jump through all of Malloy�s hoops to reregister that magazine, or they load it up, then Malloy thinks they should do felony jail time.(Off duty and retired cops: this means you too, so you better not load your 15 round Glock with more than 10 rounds and you better register every magazine !). Two faced? Hypocritical? Maybe that evil pellet gun just forced Malloy�s son into turning into a violent felon all by itself, and maybe Malloy will outlaw all pellet guns and air guns and such. Small minds really have nothing better to do than to steal freedoms away from others. And if you think that anti-civil rights crusaders like Ct Senator Blumenthal are not committed racists, look at all their proposals to tax bullets and guns beyond reach so that only people with his $70 million fortune of privileges like he has could have them or protect themselves, not ordinary people, and especially not law abiding working black people with low incomes that have a clean record and qualify for a carry permit but who may be stuck living in crime infested neighborhoods. These smug self styled emperors are wearing no clothes, and they need to be seen for who they really are&&&2

Obama to hike upper-income seniors' Medicare&&&I saw something on TV recently where people put blue dots on the wall indicating the oldest person they know. I was amazed by the number of dots that were in the nineties. If people retire at 65 and live to 90, that is 25 years on Medicare. Revenue has to be found to fund the expensive end of life care. Obamacare has steps in it to clean up the heath care industry but Single Payer will be added eventually and a billions will be saved by that alone.&&&44

America which is falling rapidly to self destruction and bankruptcy by Obama cannot be socialistic superpower anymore and it cannot afford spending money on wars with North Korea.

The "LITTLE TUPACERS" have No Morals, No Family Values, No Value for Human Life and the City is Chocked-Full of Crooked and Self-Serving Corrupt Politicians. fatuous1 is a New Orleans Native who has watch the City Decline since the Late-1970's and Early 1980's!

Has Canada Undergone a Big Shift to the Right?&&&Feminism isn�t about equal gender rights. Not anymore, anyway. It�s become about punishing and hurting White males in anyway possible. At home, at work, etc. I was in a �discussion� with a White female the other day, and she was a self-admitted race-mixer, talked about how White men were worthless, scum, claimed Blacks were superior, said our time was �over� etc. It was a disgusting and brief conversation. But in that brief correspondence, I saw the true ugliness in the hearts of most White Feminists and it made me realize that when I dropped White females from my dating pool and life � it was the right choice. I�m probably the only person on this site willing to bring this up, but I will � White females today are, to be blunt, repugnant. To be honest � a lot of them remind me of Black women, and the ones that don�t are generally trying to crush/hurt White males at any opportunity. I know there are good ones out there.. but I wouldn�t swim in an ocean of sharks to find a pearl at the very bottom.&&&3

In White House, Newtown mom pleads for gun control&&&I would like to plead to the (D)Idiot Newtown mom to plese STFU. A registered (D)emocRAT killed your son and killed his own mother.

The Conn. state police failed to stop him. 1,000 Conn. and federal laws failed to stop him. All of these school-college shooters are registered (D)emocRATS, Va Tech, Colorado, Texas, so maybe we need to just ban (D)emocRATS from owning guns. Again, I would like to ask the (D)Newtown mom to understand that she is an (D)Idiot and please STFU.&&&12

2 injured, 1 in custody after shooting at Va mall&&&Before anyone jumps to conclusions, we need to assume the shooter was abused and he is not responsible for his actions.

Lawyer Pleads Guilty to Participating Falun Gong's MIFS&&&Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York; George Venizelos, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (�FBI�); Raymond W. Kelly, the Commissioner of the Police Department for the City of New York (�NYPD�); and Patricia A. Menges, the Director of the New York Asylum Office of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (�USCIS�), announced that attorney JOHN LIN pled guilty today in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiring to commit immigration fraud. LIN is the eighth lawyer charged for his participation in a massive immigration fraud scheme involving thousands of fraudulent asylum applications that were allegedly submitted by at least 10 law firms in the New York City area. He pled guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said:�For those seeking asylum from persecution in their native countries, United States immigration laws provide a vital escape hatch. Not only did John Lin abuse those laws and violate his duties as an officer of the court, but he also made it harder for legitimate asylum seekers. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify and prosecute those who violate this country�s immigration laws.� FBI Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos remarked:�Lin, a lawyer and officer of the court, violated the ethical obligations of his profession while breaking the law. Assisting others with their fraudulent asylum claims enabled them to enter the country under false pretenses. The scheme exploited a program designed to provide safe haven for real victims of persecution.� NYPD Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said:�It�s bad enough when new arrivals to this country are victimized by common criminals, but despicable when a member of the bar dishonors his sworn duties to exploit a system designed to protect some of the most vulnerable among us.� USCIS New York Asylum Office Director Patricia A. Menges stated:�Asylum is a humanitarian protection that represents the best of American values. USCIS is committed to ensuring that criminals like Mr. Lin aren�t allowed to abuse this protection for personal gain. We appreciate the efforts of U.S. Attorney Bharara�s office, the NYPD, the FBI, and USCIS�s Fraud Detection and National Security Program in helping us protect the integrity of this important program.� According to the information and other documents filed in this case:&&&2

And according to the poll, over 82% of the people have already had the conversation, and they still think it should be illegal alien!!! The nerve of MSM!

Biden: Gun Owners - Like The Way It Feels...Like Driving a Ferrari'&&&I will trade you "one" of my ARs for a Ferrari.

This is the root source of all the recent mass shootings. All the offenders were under the age of 30, making them part of the video game culture, or they are mentally unstable. This is were the idiots that commit mass shooting offenses become desensitized to the impact of their actions.&&&7

Therefore, there are illegal aliens who are obviously older than 18 in juvie! Also, the crimes in juvie have become more sophisticated! In the old days, students would steal pencils, paper clips, etc., to make out of weapons.

Community Comment: No gun law can prevent future shootings&&&This is the most rational, well written response to the typical liberal knee jerk reaction to anything that displeases, offends, or impedes the liberal agenda to enforce their control on the general populace. Gun control is an abysmal failure. Newtown confirms that, as does Chicago, Washington and a number of other places. As long as our politicians condone gang mentality with the slap on the wrist punishments, or no punishments at all, as long as black on black crime reaps no repercussions, until the punishment meets the crime, nothing will change. Remember.... It was Obama that voted against holding gang members that killed to aid their gangs accountable. It was Obama that voted against giving gang bangers the death penalty for killing first responders to an emergency. Look up the Illinois 92nd General Assembly voting records.&&&1

'War on Women' draws return fire targeting men's reproductive options: A Closer Look&&&I agree 100% on the Viagra issue. Many side effects from these types of drugs and men are often not fully aware of these side effects. Sex therapy should be mandatory as well as a stress test. Men do need to know there are alternatives to taking a pill that has serious complications. Men are risking serious health problems taking these types of drugs. I know for a fact doctors do NOT ask any questions - just write out a prescription. Men are often written a prescription because they are "going to Vegas" for the week-end. Women who want birth control are often required to have a pelvic exam and a pap smear even though these tests are not necessary.&&&44

The old boys need to be cleaned out and a new code of military justice created which would bring them into the 21st century.

Okla. lawmakers: Let abortion drug law stand&&&Oklahoma is one of the leading states in the fight to put women back on the sidelines as regards our competency to make our own legal medical choices. This is the state that attempted to pass legislation allowing obstetricians to lie to their pregnant patients about the condition of a fetus if the physician felt (not 'could prove' or 'knew') that the woman might abort the pregnancy; without being liable to malpractice suits. The state which first tried to legislate mandatory trans-vaginal probes as prelude to an abortion. The state which tried mightily to implement legislation requiring the names of women who elect to terminate a pregnancy, to be listed on a public website - information on said public website to include age, weight, place of residence, marital status, religious preference, and the woman's stated reason for her abortion. All of which, were either overturned or stayed, by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. That Oklahoma is attempting yet another end-run around Roe v Wade does not surprise me. What surprises me, is that they haven't just declared women incompetent to direct our own lives when pregnant, and begun to criminally investigate miscarriage...yet.&&&1

what to put on with your first dating&&&Meeting your online dating mate is not easy.Your palms are sweaty, your heart is palpitating, and -- most importantly -- you don't have a single thing to wear. No, you're not getting ready to see your ex, you're going on a first date! Make a stunning first impression with your wardrobe. Chic millinery and jewelry designer Anita Hopkins has her eye on the hottest separates for baby boomers this season. Hopkins, a former Los Angeles fashion model recommends men wear a nice casual jacket or sportcoat to pull their look together. And for women, she suggests wearing clothes with a bit of texture, like silk or cashmere, and adding accessories to personalize an outfit. As nerve wracking as a first date can be, a flattering outfit can give you some added confidence, put you at ease and allow you to enjoy some valuable "me time." But what is considered "flattering" nowadays? Hopkins recommends the "little black dress -- the most genius design, thanks to Coco Chanel!" But if you think tiny dresses are made for women with personal trainers, than wear "a choker necklace with a V-neck cashmere pullover" and pants that fit and make you feel your best. Speaking from experience, Hopkins says, "Women love men with self-confidence and style!" The most flattering outfit for mature men is "a beautifully tailored suit in your best color with a nice pair of loafers." When your get-up is complete, look in the mirror, take a deep breath and make sure you feel comfortable in your clothing of choice. If you still feel like your outfit isn't quite right, consider what your ex or your mother might want you to wear, then put on the total opposite. Do you agree? Can you share your advice on online dating?&&&4

Chase customers finance terrorism, corruption, treason�&&&Chase Bank Found Guilty of Secretly Financing Terrorist Organizations Chase Bank is now responsible for a lot worse than poor customer service and unethical business practices that cost their customers millions of dollars each year. Now they�ve really crossed the line. Now we can add the financing of terrorist organizations to that list. People, businesses, organizations and nations who make it their business to murder United States citizens have had a lot of help from Chase Bank, despite sanctions imposed by the US Government making it illegal. The United States Treasury Department agreed to settle with Chase Bank for $88 million for their willful violations of US sanctions against countries that are state sponsors of terrorism. Unfortunately,$88 million is nothing to Chase Bank � the fine wouldn�t even qualify as a slap on the wrist for JPMorgan Chase. The Treasury Department�s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has been investigating a number of willful violations committed by Chase Bank going back to 2005. The list of laws violated by Chase Bank include: Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations Iranian Transactions Regulations Cuban Assets Control Regulations Sudanese Sanctions Regulations Former Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor Sanctions Regulations Reread that list and let that sink in. Chase Bank admitted to helping facilitate transactions that violated US laws regarding terrorism and weapons of mass destruction proliferation. Worse � the US Treasury found that Chase Bank was willfully violating these rules for years and even after they were notified by 3rd parties of their violations they continued to help these terrorist organizations. The question that needs to be asked, but our US media is conveniently avoiding is � How many Americans lost their lives due to the greed of Chase Bank? How many citizens of other countries died to make Jamie Dimon and the shareholders of Chase Bank wealthier? Click here to read the entire settlement agreement between the US Treasury Department and JPMorgan Chase Bank. Chase knowingly made a series of transactions with Cuba, Iran and Sudan which equaled roughly $181.4 million in violations: In 2005 and 2006, JPMorgan Chase willfully violated embargo laws by processing $178.5 million in wire transfers for Cuban nationals. A 3rd party financial institution notified Chase Bank of the violations but Chase didn�t stop and failed to notify Treasury Department officials of their crimes. In 2009 Chase Bank processed a $2.9 million loan with,�a bank that had ties to Iran�s government-owned shipping line,� a violation of trade sanctions against The Islamic Republic of Iran. JPMorgan Chase was aware of this crime, but again failed to inform regulators as required by law. In fact � they waited until the loan was almost completely repaid before notifying Treasury officials. These ships have been known to carry weapons of mass destruction and other weapons for terrorists in the past. These weapons have led to the deaths of many Americans and others which is the reason these sanctions were put in place. In 2011, the United States Treasury Department asked for documents regarding a wire transfer that referred to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. High ranking officials at JPMorgan Chase pretended to be unaware of what the Treasury Department was investigating, until The Treasury presented JPMorgan with a list of documents they believed were in the bank�s possession. After denying it the first time, the bank coughed up the documents shortly after. Sudan was the home base for Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda for years and continues to export terrorism around the world with the financial help of JPMorgan Chase and others. (next post)&&&153

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg launches political advocacy group&&&Nice try on the Republican "New World Order". Remembering back to the.days when Bush Sr launched the Mental Health "Educational Act" after the funding of the Social service Act (1980's) that incorporated the funding of the Mental Health Industry that immediately stated that our children were falling behind in the Educational systems of other countries while at the same time they began the Drug American plan on the school children. The Industry accomplished their Republican ALEC coup detat. Foreign students poured over the border as planned and every doctor was educated in foreign countries or south American Islands at US cost. Looknaround you at the foreign doctors while the American remained mind drugged and unablemto compete for the Republican "ALEC " New World Order. Nazis (& alike) did not lose WW2 according to Charlotte Iserbyt -'Skull & Bones'? see Movie 'Skull' ---------- The (APA) DSM-V is the future version of the Mein Kampf.

Grieving mother wants gun controls&&&OK!Lady, your son was killed and now to make you happy you expect the rest of the sane American gun owners to have to forgo some of their pastimes and enjoyment. Is that about what your saying? Of course there is sadness at your loss but I didn't shoot your child, in fact I wasn't even in the country. I am not under Doctors care, I and most Americans don't harbor hatred for school children or for that matter my mother and the school I went to. So you and some of the rest of the families that have had a loss feel that it is your right to keep me and a lot of Americans from doing what they enjoy. 26 families dictate how I am supposd to live my life.

City Council discusses LaRouche PAC visit&&&the larouche cult is more than a bunch of kooky ideas. they're led by a rabid antisemite who has dreams of ruling the world. unlikely, but he's willing to make lots of people suffer while he fails. larouche, like most far right wackos, will try to coopt anything popular or progressive. the larouchies tried to infiltrate the greenparty with some success in vermont and newyork. they also rolled out the 911 truth scam during the bush years to get as many democrat dupes as possible: "You do of course realize that this so-called 9/11 truth business is nothing more than a LaRouche-Tarpley invented red herring to draw otherwise well intended antiwar activists away from the pressing issue of the day -- ending the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq." the are cold blooded conartists will to let people die rather than risk embarrassment: the thing to keep in mind: no one joins a cult--they're lied to and defrauded. no one leaves a cult--they escape. the cult can't let people go; they have to spread lies and harass them. so when a cult is recruiting you KNOW they are planning to harass and stalk they very people they're inviting if they rebel. there has to be an ordinance against fraudulent representation that can be enforced against predatory organizations that pretend to be legitimate activist groups. the council should look into that angle. and kudos to them for not swallowing the larouche kool aid.&&&11

Former Congressment Foley discusses prostate cancer surgery and its side effects&&&There are certainly varying ideas of just how aggressive to be when treating postate cancer. Perhaps a man should get a second opinion from another urologist or radiation oncologist. Whatever decision is made and whatever course of action is taken, there is usually the possibility of the man developing incontinence or ED. In our practice we take penile rehabiliation very seriously. Ideally, a man should be evaluated for a penile rehabilitation program before he even has his prostate surgery or procedure. Penile rehabilitation, by enabling a man to have good erections during the critically important 1-2 year period after prostate surgery or procedure, will dramatically increase the odds of the man being to have erections like he did before the surgery or procedure. For more information on penile rehabilitation, please visit our website at: Lawrence A. Smiley, M.D.&&&6
Pentagon: NKorea Can Likely Launch Nuclear Missile&&&Obama's avid reliance on the UN to protect the American people from nuke attacks comes after he offered nuke-free world in 2009. Nevertheless, the UN does not provide any security to the American people when North Korea is ready to attack US and its allies. While Obama is busy in campaigning and fund raising for the 2014 elections and in efforts to disarm the law abiding American gun owners, The DIA told US Congress today that North Korea is capable of using nukes warheads that are installed on Ballistic Missile for medium and possible long range. Obama who was busy with Hillary to cut US nukes and US missile defense system and appease the Russian demands to remove any missile defense system that Bush planned for Poland, is calling the rogue North Korean regime that is partner with the Iranian nuke and ballistic missiles to respect the peace in the world and the UN regulations. Clearly, during the recent four years Obama did everything possible to reduce US preparedness for missile attacks from North Korea or Iran which result in American people national security depends on the plans of North Korea and Iran to oust America from Asia as dysfunctional Military power. Even General Dempsey did not response to the questions from US Congress about the DIA report refused to concur with the report that claimed that North Korea is preparing nuke attack on South Korea, Japan and the American bases in Guam and Okinawa early next week. Obviously, Obama talking about peace does not provide security to any American.&&&2

Alan Keyes: The Republic is near death and it will die if we don't wake up&&&Mr. Keyes has a right to be upset about the situation of today. However, he is premature and panicky when he predicts our nation is verging on collapse. If Mr. Keys was talking about the Republican Party and its host of wimps, careerists, corrupt politicians, and tendency to ignore the wishes of We the People, he is dead on! Even as I write this comment, many old guard Repubs in the US Senate are climbing in bed with the Marxist Obama and the socialist Democrats to restrict our constitutional rights to keep and bear arms. Remember, the Second Amendment was included in the Bill of Rights to keep government in check. Without it, the politicians in power would seek means to increase their power over We the People and perpetuate themselves in office for life. These self-serving Republicans office holders and their Democrat colleagues are facing removal from office over the next several years as they face re-election. We the People have had enough of their chicanery and corruption and will give them the boot as they seek to be returned to office. The conservative and patriotic electorate will rise in anger, beginning in the 2014 elections, and most of these would-be tyrants will be removed. Otherwise, Alan Keyes is correct: our republic will fall.&&&2

Rubio and Casey on Syria&&&Undoubtedly, the great conservative leader Marco Rubio together with Casey are right to criticize the Obama failure to address the Syrian crisis and to prevent the brutal air strike attacks that killed 70 thousand innocent Syrian children, women and men. Obama did not want to confront the Iranian-Syrian-Russian-North Korean axis of evil that provide Chemical WMDs and nukes to the Assad regime in his efforts to kill his opponent and stay in power. Obama could provide safe heaven to the Syrian people from the airstrikes of Russian jets and Iranian missiles and rockets. Rubio proved to lead a true American policy in the Middle East where Hillary Clinton destroy the relations with all former US allies and left her job while leaving trail of burned ashes behind her all over the Middle east and Northern Africa.&&&2

Obama Opens Window for Russians to Contest Magnitsky Sanctions&&&In what the White House called a �routine delegation� of responsibilities, Obama on Friday formally tasked the US Treasury and State Departments with implementing key aspects of the Magnitsky Act, which introduces visa and financial sanctions on Russian officials suspected of human rights abuses. But according to a Congressional memo obtained by RIA Novosti, the move also opens a window for Russian officials to challenge the sanctions as �arbitrary and capricious� under the US Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which applies to agencies like State and Treasury but not to the US president. �If such a delegation was to occur and a court found that the acting agency�s determinations were reviewable, a reviewing court would evaluate the agency�s actions under the arbitrary and capricious test,� according to the Feb. 25 Congressional memo, which analyzes legal aspects of the Magnitsky Act. Of course, getting a US court to review whether Washington was justified in placing Russian officials on the so-called �Magnitsky List��which by law must be made public this week�is only half the battle in such cases, said Kevin Stack, an expert on presidential power at Vanderbilt Law School in Tennessee. �My sense is that it would be possible to get review but very hard to actually obtain a reversal,� Stack told RIA Novosti on Monday. Critics of the Magnitsky Act have also said it is at odds with the fundamentals of American jurisprudence, including the presumption of innocence and due process, because the allegations against the Russian officials are not being tested in a court of law. The most fertile ground for a Russian official to challenge the sanctions would probably concern the asset freeze aspect of the Magnitsky Act, which arguably could violate the US Constitution�s directive that no one should be �deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,� legal experts told RIA Novosti. �An imaginative lawyer might come up with more than I can, but I think the argument would have to be constitutional, especially as to any asset freeze,� said Paul Stephan, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. Such lawsuits could be filed in any US court, said Stephan and Stack.&&&2

Tentative deal on immigration farm workers&&&Immigrants are less concerned what economic impact their migration might have on the economy. They just want to get into a society where they�d feel safe and have a chance to raise their families in a peaceful and normal environment. In many cases though, they end up in situations far worse than the one they�re fleeing from. Job is also not the only reason people migrate. There are those who forced their way into America because it is today�s version of the biblical �land that flows with milk and honey�. Many view USA as a place to escape oppressive regimes in their homelands. Others come to America because the social amenities, democracy and way of living are second-to-none. To try and close the door against the rest of the world may not yield long-lasting positive results. I have lived in several countries across the globe, largely as an immigrant. I know what it is like fleeing ones native country into another. No one leaves his natural habitat when prevailing conditions are favorable. Immigrants that bring crimes and lawlessness should be deported without hesitation. Immigration is a two-faced social issue; it has both good and evil. Evils emanating from immigration seem to have overshadowed every good that comes with it. Based on my immigration experiences from all over the places, I would suggest that people of similar ethnic grouping should live together and not emigrate. I did not mince words in my book titled �Evicted From My Space�. This book reveals all the evils I experienced during my 22 years of skipping borders. I have lived with several peoples of the world; I have been the guinea pig used in studying people�s reactions in several immigration situations.&&&1

Device to scare birds causes Guard base lockdown&&&What was scariest to me was the idiot cop from Madison who caused a car wreck. I'm pretty familiar with the layout of that part of Jackson & Madison is about a good half hr away from the airport area. What the f**k could he have done by rushing to the scene? Weren't there 10 to 20 other in-county(that's Rankin County, I am pretty sure) sheriff's deputies or city-police(Brandon & Pearl are right there) who could have responded? Don't they have M16 automatic weapons on the base or @ least Glocks or semi-auto pistols to respond to such an event "in-house?" I also know(I've flown from that airport before) that they have in-house airport cops there who could have responded. Why is it when there's an event that 50 to 100 cops from the surrounding 50 square miles all have to converge thinking one or 2 extra dudes is gonna make a difference? Regular cops have AR15 semi-autos if not full auto rifles in their trunks & tactical police shotguns(Mossbergs, I think, good products)-- do they really need a jackass with an oversized ego causing the taxpayer thousands in damage to a vehicle & who could potentially have killed somebody over a stupid starter pistol designed to scare away buzzards? The local cops up there need better personnel protocols on responses. Cops from Madison don't need to travel halfway across the next county over to respond to something when the city & county police were more than manpower enough....talk about blown out of proportion & a gross risky waste of taxpayer funds in this deep recession.&&&1

Liars! Illegal Immigration Surging While Obama Administration Claims it is Declining&&&I have a family member that lives in a home near a house that literally is a drop house in Utah. These people come late at night in vans. Stay for a few days and come out of this house showered and cleaned up. This happens everyday and every week as this family member notes. I have told her to turn in the family, but she fears repercusians. I on the other hand have decided to tell what I KNOW. Lindsay Graham appeared on Meet the Press today and mentioned our lost Sovereignty. I was happy that he is holding firm to the Notion that we must secure the border first. They will continue to spill in like locust if we don't. Our border is not secure. We don't have contained Sovereignty. And Obama and his dog's are liars. They want to allow reform without border security. Even Rubio won't agree to it.&&&26

Freeport NY (11520) Police Department Corruption Investigation&&&The Nassau County Attorney General's Office/ U.S. Department of Justice (FBI) should start carrying out corruption investigation allegations made by several Freeport residents that have not been investigated concerning collusion + pay offs between the Freeport Police Members and the Drug Dealers in Freeport, Long Island, New York. Several residents in the past 2 years have called the police complaining of drug dealing activity in their neighborhoods (Broadway, Main Street, Pine Street Apartment Complexes) and the Police called the drug dealers to disperse before they arrived. The FBI/Department of Justice/Nassau County District Attorney's Office needs to carry out investigations as to possible collusion and drug activity coverups and arrests for corruption needs to be made. Those police need to be fired, indicted, and arrested. Perhaps all of the Freeport Police needs to be replaced by the Nassau County Police Department.&&&2

Rape Culture&&&I've been reading a lot about a so called 'rape culture' that exists and then I came across this blog by jugybitch who talks about getting drunk and having sex and she says,"I�m willing to bet that every single varsity athlete or high status (medicine, engineering, computer science) male on any given college campus has had the experience. Why? Because they get hunted. All the time. By women. You see these guys staggering bleary-eyed into the dorm rooms the next morning, bro-punching their friends and saying �Dude, how could you let me do that?� The walk of shame: it�s almost a rite of passage. One that men seem to relish, enjoy and get over pretty damn quickly. Yeah, you f*cked an ugly chick. Or a annoying chick. Whatever. You drank too much, lost all your reason and tumbled into bed with someone you wouldn�t normally touch with a ten yard pole. Ho hum. Where we going tonight, bros? Many women, on the other hand, are completely f*cked in the head in this exact same situation. They get dressed up in their best whore clothes, head out to a frat party, drink their faces off, end up in bed with some guy they wouldn�t normally touch with a ten yard pole, wake up the next morning feeling like a total slutbag and then, it happens: Someone must be to blame for this! I can�t possibly have gotten shitfaced and exercised some really poor judgement.�Moi? Ce n�est pas possible! I am an innocent blushing virgin with impeccable moral standards. Why, only whores get smashed and f*ck random guys in a frat house, and I am not a whore so JESUS MOTHER OF GOD I WAS RAPED!� Bitch, please. You weren�t raped. You were trashed. Why is it that men are held responsible for their actions no matter what their state of inebriation, but women get a pass? It doesn�t matter if you were drunk, stripped naked, straddled the guy in your best cowgirl position and f*cked like a banshee. You were drunk. You can�t consent. So you were raped. Right? Dude might have been just as pissed up as you, but he can�t cry rape because: rationality. So only men are rational creatures? Really? Bull. Shit."&&&1

But the PSV boss is unhappy at how recent comments have been interpreted by media, telling De Telegraaf:�I always try to tell you what I think and feel, but at some point it comes back at me the wrong way. �Nowadays you can apparently no longer show emotions. So next time I�ll just smile to you, because I can act very well. as reported by Indo Eleven. �If you say you�ve come to PSV to be champion, it�s not good. In hindsight I should have said we (would come) fourth. Then we would have done fantastically. �The negativity is rampant.� Source :&&&1

Pentagon struggles with high cost of health care&&&There is no science to the mental health industry. No medical model. NO evidence based medicine. No test for chemical imbalance of the brain to which the APA admitted to the falsehood in 2004. The industry is based on hearsay and is political. Inside the Battle to Define Mental Illness Every so often Al Frances says something that seems to surprise even him. Just now, for instance, in the predawn darkness of his comfortable, rambling home in Carmel, California, he has broken off his exercise routine to declare that �there is no definition of a mental disorder. It�s bullshit. I mean, you just can�t define it.� Then an odd, reflective look crosses his face, as if he�s taking in the strangeness of this scene: Allen Frances, lead editor of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (universally known as the DSM-IV), the guy who wrote the book on mental illness, confessing that �these concepts are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the boundaries.� For the first time in two days, the conversation comes to an awkward halt. There are no genetic tests, no brain scans, blood tests, chemical imbalance tests or X-rays that can scientifically/medically prove that any psychiatric disorder is a medical condition.&&&10

Wei Liu: My School Days in China: 1.1 20 Square Meter Home&&&Book Series: My School Days in China The memoir part written by Wei Liu in Chinese, google machine translated into English, proofread by Wei Liu April 7, 2013 Foreword Common people also write their memoirs. As an ordinary people in China, when I write memoirs, a lot of people say, "You're not a celebrity. You write the memoirs, but who will read it?" I think if someone said to them, "You are the cheap, inferior "These people will certainly be furious, However, to be fair, these people do not consider themselves inferior? I firmly believe that everyone is equal. My memoir writes about the ups and downs of ordinary people, including the closely related social events will serve the reader better than those who do not focus on common people�s daily life. Literature of their content is actually happened or fictional standards are divided into non-fiction literature and fiction literature two categories. The non-fiction literary autobiography, memoirs. Fictional literary fiction is usually what people say novel. Under this classification prose is unclear, confusing literature category, should be removed. So do not talk about literature is fiction. Some people say, "I read 40 novels this year." 40 book, all fictional scenes? Like Qiong Yao's "Outside the Window" is her autobiography, is a non-fiction literature, not fictional literature, not fiction. If the reader can not distinguish fiction or non-fiction, and they may just say,�I read 40 literary works this year.� My book series Walking Through the Six Years of the Entrance Examination to College in China� or �My School Days in China� is my memoirs, autobiography , of course, belongs to the non-fictional literature. Anything to claim 100% are unlikely. 100% consent is unlikely to happen and 100% against is unlikely to happen. We use 50% for the demarcation of boundaries. 50% or more consent is consent and 50% or more against is against. Similarly, if a work of more than 50% of the text is actually happening, this work is non-fiction literature. If more than 50% of the text of a work is fictional, this work is fictional literature, novels. In this book series, except myself, other people around me only write the last name, do not write their first name, they know who they are. Writing about common people�s life, I give solution for the 1.3 billion Chinese people to depart misery and have happiness. We welcome anyone to spread this published book. As long as you do not charge readers money , you don�t give me any money. In accordance with the International Rules for the purpose of education, since my book series bears such educational mission to let Chinese people be aware of their human rights, it can refer to other works not subject to copyright restrictions. I wish those largely consent to my idea of the 4 fundamental human rights spread the truth out by talking to 1 or more people every month, to save ourselves, our friends and our nation. The end of the foreword "My School Days in China" to be continued More articles of mine both Chinese and English are in my blog If one likes to listen the words, google translate can read the words aloud for you.

Survey: 71 Percent Of Americans Say Illegal Immigrants Should Be Given Chance To Stay In US&&&Will the illegals pay taxes during five years before they amnesty or will they enjoy food stamps and freebees paid by the 47 % working Americans? Clearly, the 8-gangster senators committee is pushing America to anarchy and chaos and allowing the flood of forty million terrorists from the Middle East and drug dealers from South America to cross the border at any time after their 'deal' and get the food stamps from Obama in return for their vote to defeat the GOP and remove Boehner from the House Speaker position. Every American know that the flood of illegal invaders from the Middle East, South America and Asia aimed at getting free checks from Obama and has nothing to do with US citizenship that nobody care for because it involves paying taxes that the invaders despise. Will the RINOs John McCain and Lindsey Graham sell America to forty million illegal invaders that will cross the border in the near future to get free Obama phone, Obama check and Obama care in return for voting for the liberal Democrats?&&&22

Cuban-American GOP Reps Challenge Jay-Z and Beyonce's Trip To Cuba&&&I quote a letter sent by 2 GOP Reps'(both Miami-Cubans, who try to set US Policy regarding Cuba). They were both defeated in the last election, so they definitely DON'T represent,'the will of the people', on this subject! Quote: Dear Director Szubin: We write to express concern and to request information regarding the highly publicized trip by U.S. musicians Beyonc� Knowles-Carter (Beyonc�) and Shawn Carter (Jay-Z) to Cuba. We would like to respectfully request, within all applicable rules and guidelines, information regarding the type of license that Beyonc� and Jay-Z received, for what purpose, and who approved such travel. As you know, U.S. law expressly prohibits the licensing of financial transactions for �tourist activities� in Cuba (Section 910(b)(1) of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act). If these individuals were given people-to-people licenses, we would like to bring to your attention the Cuba Travel Advisory issued by OFAC on July 25, 2011 which states,�OFAC only licenses People-to-People Groups that certify that all participants will have a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in Cuba.� These restrictions are in place because the Cuban dictatorship is one of four U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism with one of the world�s most egregious human rights records. Cuba�s tourism industry is wholly state-controlled; therefore, U.S. dollars spent on Cuban tourism directly fund the machinery of oppression that brutally represses the Cuban people. Despite the clear prohibition against tourism in Cuba, numerous press reports described the couple�s trip as tourism, and the Castro regime touted it as such in its propaganda. We represent a community of many who have been deeply and personally harmed by the Castro regime�s atrocities, including former political prisoners and the families of murdered innocents. The restrictions on tourism travel are common-sense measures meant to prevent U.S. dollars from supporting a murderous regime that opposes U.S. security interests at every turn and which ruthlessly suppresses the most basic liberties of speech, assembly, and belief. We support the Cuban people by refusing to sustain their jailers. Thank you very much for your assistance in this important matter and look forward to your response. Sincerely, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen Mario Diaz-Balart Member of Congress Member of Congress. End of Quote These rep's, plus Marco Rubio, have continually tried to keep the foolish, US Embargo on Cuba in effect, and they create the very tainted information regarding Cuba, fed to the US Government, as well as to the Canadian Government. Their version of Cuba, is starkly removed from reality - and that's what we receive, to spread out to the newsrooms, in both our nations. Rubio, one of the three, is possibly going to make a run for the US Presidential Election, next term. Is that the kind of president you want for the United States? Somebody who fabricates stories NOW, Will be EVEN BETTER AT IT, by the time the next election rolls around. He has shown he is a liar now, and he also will be a liar, later, if elected! Mark my word on this!&&&8
chelsea clinton opens door to run&&&Not-normal-looking, publicity-hungry, and talentless. She's the political version of a kardashian. __________ Chelsea Clinton opens door to run By KEVIN ROBILLARD | 4/8/13 8:18 AM EDT Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton said Monday she would consider running for office if she could make a �meaningful� impact on the country. �Right now, I�m grateful to live in a city and a state and a country where I strongly support my mayor, my governor, my president and my senators and my representative,� Clinton, who lives in New York City, said on NBC�s �Today.��If at some point that weren�t true and I thought I could make a meaningful and measurably greater impact, you know, I�d have to ask and answer that question.� Clinton, who works for NBC as a �special correspondent,� also said she expects her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to �make the right choice for herself� regarding a 2016 presidential run. �I deeply respect and appreciate all of the admiration and respect and gratitude for my mother�s service,� Chelsea Clinton said.�As a daughter, I very much want her to make the right choice for herself. I know that will be the right choice for our country, and I�ll support her in whatever she chooses to do.� The interview was part of an ongoing roll-out of Chelsea Clinton�s public persona. Last week, the formerly camera-shy first daughter hosted several panels at the Clinton Global Initiative. She was also on the cover of Parade Magazine on Sunday.&&&2

Church: Pastor Rick Warren's son commits suicide&&&Another victim of the Mental Health Industry that died by mind drugs and false diagnoses . There is no science to the mental health industry. No medical model. NO evidence based medicine. No test for chemical imbalance of the brain to which the APA admitted to the falsehood in 2004. The industry is based on hearsay and is political. Inside the Battle to Define Mental Illness Every so often Al Frances says something that seems to surprise even him. Just now, for instance, in the predawn darkness of his comfortable, rambling home in Carmel, California, he has broken off his exercise routine to declare that �there is no definition of a mental disorder. It�s bullshit. I mean, you just can�t define it.� Then an odd, reflective look crosses his face, as if he�s taking in the strangeness of this scene: Allen Frances, lead editor of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (universally known as the DSM-IV), the guy who wrote the book on mental illness, confessing that �these concepts are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the boundaries.� For the first time in two days, the conversation comes to an awkward halt. There are no genetic tests, no brain scans, blood tests, chemical imbalance tests or X-rays that can scientifically/medically prove that any psychiatric disorder is a medical condition.&&&11

The all died with or without and the peoples must suffer a lot- by chemie and nuclear treatments. Stopping this mess of nuclear production would be a good thing to do. All nuclear power = unneeded and destructive power/energy. Making weapons-of mass destruction is the most dumm-evil way of inventing ever. Now is possible what tomorrow maybe destroys us all. Give Iran a bonus to have non in 2013.&&&2

N.Y. Democrat: I got death threats over gun control support&&&As President Obama prepares to head to Colorado on Wednesday to push gun control legislation, some are calling into question the validity of a key statistic he�s using to tout his message on near-universal background checks. During several speeches, Obama has said 40 percent of all gun purchases were made without a background check. But that number is nearly two decades old and comes from a poll with a relatively tiny sample size. Gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association, as well as The Washington Post�s �Fact Checker,� are calling out the president�s stat, saying his numbers on background checks need a background check of their own. During a speech last week, Obama asked,�Why wouldn�t we want to make it more difficult for a dangerous person to get his or her hand on a gun? Why wouldn�t we want to close the loophole that allows as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases to take place without a background check? Why wouldn�t we do that?� The oft-cited figure, it turns out, was pulled from a 1997 study done by the National Institute of Justice. In the study, researchers estimated about 40 percent of all firearm sales took place through people other than licensed gun dealers. The conclusion was based on data from a 1994 survey of 2,568 households. Of those, only 251 people answered the question about where they got their guns. PolitiFact tracked down the co-author of the study, Duke University professor Philip Cook, and asked him if he thought the 40 percent estimate is accurate. �The answer is I have no idea,� Cook reportedly told PolitiFact.�This survey was done almost 20 years ago.� Read more:&&&98

Raoul Felder Self Proclaimed "King of Divorce", is King Pin" In NYC Divorce Co&&&IMMEDIATE RELEASE: For LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FBI Raoul Felder is Calling Out His Big Dangerous Guns to Submerge His Involvement With Criminal Activity in New York Courts With New York State Supreme Court Judge Laura Drager It is reported that his contacts are dangerous. Only in New York Could This Kind of Corruption Be Allowed to Happen to Decent Women and Children. Raoul Felder, the Corrupt Divorce Attorney that CBS "dubbed" as Captain of Divorce throws each and every one of his clients to the wolves....He is Lieutenant of New York's Notorious "Divorce Company", Overseen by Supreme Court Judge Laura Drager. If CBS or any news organization just did just a bit of research, they would uncover extensive information and documentation related to his corrupt activities. Raoul Felder is notorious "for tanking" the property of innocent decent people to collect outrageous and undeserved fees incurred by his illegal practices and behavior. He will steal the home out from under a client, and throw them out onto the street, to keep the corrupt divorce machine "oiled and running" Hundreds are calling for the Removal of Judge Laura Drager at because of her corruption. Raoul Lionel Felder is right there beside Judge Drager he is the quintessential "pimp" to the Drager, the "Madame and CEO" and CEO of New York's Corrupt Divorce Company, where rich power brokers get richer, by making richer lawyers even richer. It has known for years that Raoul Felder is the King of the "Double Dippers". We all also know that he is a crook. He has made it impossible for a decent attorney to represent our clients on the merits of the case, but he has the matrimonial judges in his pocket because of payoffs and criminal influence. Every one in the matrimonial industry knows that this matrimonial attorney makes sure his client doesn't win in divorce, but he and Judge Laura Drager come out the financial victors. Raoul Felder was thrown off the Judicial Conduct Committee for misconduct. When does CBS actually do a story that protects the innocent and not glorify a rich attorney, who uses Howard Rubinestein's PR Firm to perpetuate an agenda for a damaging sub par attorney. Raoul Felder, has been known to all as the "Matrimonial Double-Dipper". He first takes a fee from the wife, and then takes a fee from the husband, to sink the wife's case, and then works with Judge Laura Drager to arrange the unlawful seizure of the woman's property and home. "Old Raoul" has been arranging the "sinking of women" for years along with Judge Drager. It is suggested that CBS and other News Organizations do some research,because "Old Raoul Felder" engages in unlawful activity for his own personal gain.

GOP state lawmaker backs gay marriage, says more may join&&&GAY MARRIAGE IN ILLINOIS AND LIFE: Some argue same-sex/gay marriage is a slippery slope leading to the abolition of all marriage. There is truth in this argument. The real issue, however, hidden behind the smoke screen of same-sex/gay marriage is an attack on the Roman Catholic Church in Illinois. Furthermore, this attack on the Roman Catholic Church has at it source anti-Semitism. This is the case because the Roman Catholic Church is one of the few institutions in the world that takes Judaism seriously, something some Jews don't even do. To be in favor of same-sex/gay marriage is to ultimately be in favor of death over life. The logic of this may not be self-evident, but surely the symbolism of the defining act is. Life is the principle value in Judaism, and in turn it is at the root of Roman Catholicism, too. How is life in this world sustained? The common sense answer to this is the symbols inherent in heterosexual love and marriage. In opposition to this symbolism, same-sex/gay marriage offers us the symbolism of anal intercourse. Instead of the bright new face of a child, we are offered the dark, bottomless hole of sex divorced from procreation. This is the same dark hole into which the Nazis wanted to condemn the Jews. To be against same-sex/gay marriage is not to be against GLBT people. To be against same-sex/gay marriage is not to be blind to the problems and discrimination GLBT people suffer in the world. Be that as it may, same-sex/gay marriage is not a moral solution to these problems or that discrimination. Consider the analogy of poverty. Yes, there are poor people with problems. Nevertheless, stealing is not a moral solution to the problem of poverty. The best moral solution to poverty is not communism, but charity and a republic with a constitution and a free economy. Likewise, the best GLBT people can hope for is not an immoral redefinition of marriage, but life in a constitutional republic. An all powerful, progressive state cannot tolerate religion, especially Roman Catholicism and Judaism. Nothing, especially God, must come between the individual and the government. Such a government will use same-sex/gay marriage to attack and discredit religion. A government that adopts same-sex/gay marriage is by definition anti-Semitic. Illinois should not join the anti-Semites of the world by adopting same-sex/gay marriage. You say all love is equal, but if same-sex/gay marriage passes into law you will see only what the Nazi upheaval saw--all death is equal. ###&&&1

Oil, gas wells in northwestern NM show potential&&&FARMINGTON, N.M.(AP)� The oil and gas industry is getting excited about a potential boom in northwestern New Mexico. Preliminary results from some of the 22 exploratory wells drilled in the Mancos shale formation in the San Juan Basin show commercial potential for production, according to industry executives who visited Farmington this week. Ken McQueen of Oklahoma-based WPX Energy Inc. told the Albuquerque Journal ( ) that two wells the company drilled in 2010 in a dry natural gas section of the Mancos have produced 2 billion cubic feet of gas so far. He described the area as an "attractive target" to pursue. "These two wells are in the top 10 best wells drilled by WPX to date," he said. "They're quite extraordinary for us." Energy development companies were hopeful about the prospects for liquid natural gas and oil in other sections of the Mancos formation. Sign Up for the Daily E-dition newsletter! Mancos shale is sandwiched between soft sandstone layers in the San Juan Basin that producers have been exploiting for decades. Modern drilling techniques allow resources trapped inside the rock-hard shale to be tapped. Three dimensional imaging helps pinpoint oil and gas deposits, while hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling can access the deposits. "I'm bullish on the Mancos," said T. Greg Merrion, president of Merrion Oil and Gas Corp. in Farmington. His company is partnering with Denver-based Bill Barrett Corp. to drill exploratory oil wells in the area. "We've already seen a number of wells drilled that are economic," Merrion said. Eight companies have received permits to drill 45 wells. Almost half of the wells are producing or ready to produce. Among those are a dozen wells being developed by Canada's Encana Corp. The company has invested $100 million in the Mancos play.

Afghan president welcomes US remarks on Taliban&&&As usual the Obama Administration implements a smart and reasoned approach.

What's the Best Label for 'Illegal Immigrants'&&&Obama and his regime would like to call them Americans. They'll maybe force their will on the American people, force the Government and Politicians to legitimize them somehow. But they'll never be known for anything except breaking into another Country, taking what does not belong to them and always being shunned by the truth seekers that know who they are. Nothing they can do will ever, make us change the name. ILLEGAL ILLEGAL leeches.&&&23

US Sen. Mark Warner to seek re-election in '14&&&Won't consider giving him my vote until he answers some questions. How is it that a fully automatic M4 in the hands of the DHS is a �Personal Defense Weapon�, but a semi-automatic AR-15 in the hands of a legally armed citizen (me) is an assault weapon? Why did you vote to support a UN treaty that would be in violation of the US Constitution's 2nd Amendment?

#4 - AP Whitewashes Illegal Immigrants&&&Definitions Alien, Immigrant, Illegal Alien, Undocumented Immigrant These related terms are often used in deliberately confusing and conflicting ways. Here is a set of definitions that will help you sort out the difference. IMMIGRANT: In popular usage, an "immigrant" is generally understood to be a person who migrates to another country, usually for permanent residence. Under this definition, therefore, an "immigrant" is an alien admitted to the U.S. as a lawful permanent resident. The emphasis in this definition is upon the presumptions that (1) the immigrant followed U.S. laws and procedures in establishing residence in our country; (2) he or she wishes to reside here permanently; and (3) he or she swears allegiance to our country or at least solemnly affirms that he/she will observe and respect our laws and our Constitution. ALIEN: By contrast, an "alien" is generally understood to be a foreigner -- a person who comes from a foreign country -- who does not owe allegiance to our country. ILLEGAL ALIEN: An "illegal alien" is a foreigner who (1) does not owe allegiance to our country; and (2) who has violated our laws and customs in establishing residence in our country. He or she is therefore a criminal under applicable U.S. laws. The term "illegal alien" is used by U.S. citizens who believe that non-citizens entering our country must comply with our immigration laws. The term "illegal alien" is predicated upon U.S. immigration law which requires foreigners entering the U.S. to comply with our country's rules and laws regarding entry into, and residence within, our country. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT: The term "undocumented immigrant" is an oxymoron (the parts conflict). An immigrant is synonymous with "permanent legal resident." The old term for the document authorizing a permanent legal resident is "green card." The term "undocumented" is derived from the accurate term "undocumented aliens" who are often called "border crossers." Proper terms are "illegal alien" or "undocumented alien" but not "undocumented immigrant." Although not commonly used, the term "documented alien" accurately refers to foreign nationals who have an unexpired non-immigrant visa such as H-1B. Most U.S. citizens do not use the term "undocumented immigrant" and prefer, instead, the more descriptive and accurate term "illegal alien". The term "undocumented immigrant" is used by those who believe in "open borders", i.e., non-regulation of foreigners entering into and assuming residence in the U.S., including even those foreigners who owe allegiance to a foreign government and/or who may intend harm to the U.S.&&&4

Long early voting line in Columbus OH today&&&I was up there this afternoon intending to early vote. It was completely insane. Traffic backed up on Morse Road all the way back to the freeway.

Tuesday was going to be tight due to some other commitments, and we have made voting into a family tradition--hard to pull off around everyone's schedul. Just have to take some time off and get er done. But for those who have been down on the need for early voting--maybe it's time to study the numbers of voters and the real capacity of the current system.&&&362

I remember that some warnings were out there about "acutane"{sp.} some years ago and some congresssmans son commited suicide after taking a drug for pimples. It was also suspect in other teen deaths and was said to cause paranoia? Who needs this crap? May be the sudden increase in teen weird behaviours can be attributed to side effects of an acme medication? I wish sherlock holmes detectives want to bes would really check into this. It may be that the acme medication is turning people teens and young college people into psychotics? If birth defects and teen behaviour is all attributed to acme medications the simple solution is: IF IN DOUBT THROW IT OUT and save lives and money&&&7

Good. Hale also indicated that the Pentagon plans to ask for base realignments and closures, according to Federal News Radio, which first reported on the web conference. Lawmakers last year rejected such proposals. Why are lawmakers rejecting pentagon proposals to save money? Isn't THAT what "lawmakers" are supposed to do?&&&70

While this was all happening the notorious Judge Drager was meeting with the wife's former attorney who she fired a year prior "for cause", to ensure that Mr. Felder was getting paid $250,000. Raoul Felder, has been known to all as the "Matrimonial Double-Dipper". He first takes a fee from the wife, and then takes a fee from the husband, to sink the wife's case, and then works with Judge Laura Drager to arrange the unlawful seizure of the woman's property and home. Arrest this Judge, Arrest Raoul Felder. "Old Raoul" has been arranging the "sinking of women" for years along with Judge Drager. Hundreds Have Demanded The Removal of Judge Laura Drager at&&&1

Fluvanna County Republicans Get out the Vote in Palmyra - NBC29 WVIR Charlottesville, VA News, Sports and Weather&&&Do they even KNOW who they are supporting? Romney and Ryan has such deep and guarded secrets. Paul Ryan praised Ayn Rand, a notorious ANTI-CHRIST, in a full prepared speech at a tribute to her. She is sometimes called a 'Goddess' to economic conservatives. And she was fascinated, to the point almost of adoring, of a sexually sadistic child rapist/murderer, who cut off the dear child's limbs, and gutted her. AS A CONGRESSMAN, not in high school long ago, BUT AS A CONGRESSMAN in 2005!, Paul Ryan praised her. Not in a off hand comment, but in a FULL PREPARED SPEECH! Why is he keeping the text of his prepared speech hidden? Willard Romny keep deep guarded secrets. He keeps secret his FOREIGN ALLEGIANCES. Hundred MILLION dollars OR MORE in SECRET FOREIGN account, banks, and corporations, UNDER FOREIGN LAW and SUBJECT TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. And he has the nerve to say anything about other's foreign affairs. Romney has SECRET FOREIGN AFFAIRS, UNDER FOREIGN LAWS, AND SUBJECT to FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS (and since we don't know, he might - like George BUSH - have secret ties to FOREGN POTENTATES and MUSLIM PRINCES!? We just don't know because he keeps them deep guarded secrets. Further, Mr Romney keeps secret his reasons for avoiding military service to the America that made his SUPER RICH. He avoided military service to go live in France. What did he do in France that is equivalent to the sacrifice made by so many American youth in military service? Mr Romney must pass on his family secret reasons for avoiding military service: his FIVE sons have also avoided military service. Why? Should Americans know the guarded secrets of his family : why they avoid military service? Shouldn't anyone who wants to be Commander in Chief - who yet AVOIDED MILITARY SERVICE - tell us why? Virginians ought not vote for an ANTI-CHRIST admirer who was also a child rapist admirer? Virginians ought not vote for someone who AVOIDS MILITARY SERVICE for secret reasons, refusing to serve a country that made him super rich?&&&38

The Fed plans to destroy the economy&&&Americans have seen the warnings, year after year, from both conservative and liberal experts, yet they just stand like idiots on a the tracks, watching an approaching train. They cling to a fantasy that Superman will fly in an save them, instead of choosing to become responsible adults who fight for those dependent on them. Facts: The Fed banks created a massive banking fraud, resulting in a worldwide recession, and were not truly held accountable. They eliminated a lot of competition, were given bailouts, and will have taken ownership of tens of millions of homes soon. Some believe that one of the Fed�s goal is to control the population by controlling housing, food, and jobs. Their actions give credibility to those theories. It�s very clear that a few have gotten away with treason, and have a hidden agenda which is meant to harm the USA and its people for their personal gain. Many feel that the Fed is the greatest threat to the survival of the U.S. Clearly, the recession isn�t going away in the next few years, and during that time, many more millions of jobs and homes will be lost. That will not happen because of what the Fed is doing, but because the American people didn�t have the integrity or intelligence to recognize an enemy and fight for their families and the victims of a massive crime wave. If you�re not trying to end the Fed, you�re promote the treason. For ways to fight back: (next post)&&&100

Natural cold and flu remedies for children&&&It was always been a debate whether or not chemical medications are good for the heath or have no side effects on the body especially on children. Over the years, there have been many recalls on several drugs due to inadequate or worse non-existent testing procedures. This is a major burden to parents when their children become ill. Little did they know that there are other medications cheaper and safer. Here are some tips: These following guidelines are your medicine cabinet�s must haves: This is something good for children and adults� alike, homeopathic medicines can be found at most health food store in quick dissolving tablet form. Belladonna- 6C: Best and helpful for fevers that come on unexpectedly, and it is also good for clear runny nose. Belladonna is helpful as well in easing headaches and inflamed red sore throats. Pulsatilla-6C: When nasal discharge is thicker and children are acting clingy and weepy try using this because this is good for it. What�s more is it is helpful for earaches that are less intense. Chamomilla- 6C: For irritability and digestive issues, this homeopathic remedy is very good for those sicknesses. And also this is a great help to ease severe pain associated with teething, earaches and gas pains. Homemade medicines are a lot cheaper, safer and easy access. Unlike commercial products that contain petroleum based, vapor rub is something you can do yourself. Here is how: mix eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils with your favorite oil and rub the mixture on feet and chest, easy! Without alcohol and other additives, onion and honey cough medicine is a wonderful homemade alternative. Be certain to use good honey; local, organic, raw honey is the finest as it will help to prevent allergies too. The benefit of both honey and onion is that it reduces bronchial constriction because both have anti-bacterial properties and onions contain a compound that. Any onion color will do, chop it and place in a jar, and cover the onion bits with honey. The next day, discard the onion pieces and save the liquid. This next tip has been used to promote health for centuries now. Honey and cinnamon, this mixture can aid at the first sign of cold and has proven to boost the immune system whether separately or together. To get rid of the cold, just mix one teaspoon of honey with a teaspoon of cinnamon, your colds will be gone in couple of days. This may sound a little unrealistic for some but definitely true, the healing power of touch. This healing power can be in the form of hugs, kisses, cuddles or even light placement of the hands on areas where there is pain and discomfort. Many studies can back-up that healing touch can reduce pain, boost the immune system, lower stress levels and promote relaxation and healing. Aside from being cost effective and easy to prepare, natural cold and flu remedies have higher success rate. Homeopathic medicines act to cure the imbalances that preceding to sickness and can be used to stop the illness altogether. They are better than the commercial. Over the counter medicines simply mask the symptoms, or antibiotics that are shown to lower the immune system and decrease resistance. It is also a good fraud prevention, no will never get scammed. Go for alternative medicines.&&&1

House Homeland Security member: North Korea not bluffing&&&The threat of North Korea to attack South Korea and US bases could be real when America�s military became dysfunctional under Obama and when North Korea, Russia and China know that Obama will never fight back such attacks. House Homeland Security Committee GOP Peter King is right to claim that North Korean threats are real and not bluff. North Korea new regime realized that the world's power balance changed with the incompetent Obama as commander in chief which proved to be most hesitant and weakest in US history. North Korea were surprised that Obama and his pacifist 'Defense' secretary sent two B-52 aircrafts from America to fly over South Korea and come back to America without landing s proof that America will not fight back if South Korea is attacked by North Korea. North Korea could take few bases in the Korean Peninsula with Obama and Chuck Hagel doing nothing to prevent it. The American military under Obama lost its deterrent power and it is time for the American people to realize that their deceitful Emperor Obama is naked and has no clothes.&&&21

My Republocrat views&&&Democrats sometimes make dumb decisions, and so do Republicans. I vote independent but I think they only got office like once or twice. My Democratic views: Abortion: Yes, babies are a huge inconvenience, I even took the liberty of getting a vasectomy. Can you imagine being a university student and one day the condom decided to open for fresh air? That will suck, so does parenthood. Man/Woman equal wage: I really don't see why not, makin women earn less is like... a dick move, literly. Gay/Lesbian marriage: Doesn't effect me, the chances of homosexuals overpopulating isn't likely. I'll just be doing my thing, they do... theirs. And we get on with our lives Republican Views: Less taxes/Less welfare: -Taxes are good, they go to the city and help build buildings and railroads. Welfare? I'm okay with that, but people who worked hard, finished a few years of a university or college, they deserve to keep their money. They shouldn't give their hard-earned wealth to those who dropped out of school and screwed around. Some are unfortunate but distinguishing them is hard, so I think welfare is ok. No Gun Control: -I could make gun control laws so criminals can stop killing, oh wait, criminals don't follow laws. Even without gun controls a mugger can break into a house with a knife and something to make a fire, the best the house resident could do Is grab a gun and shoot the b*stard. But only people with an id/clean record can get a gun. Strict Immigration laws: -I understand people come here to get a job, but they will have to wait. I'm not racist, you can be from Canada or the UK, I still believe immigration should be strict. America is already overpopulated as it is. Foreign Policy: -Don't invade every little nation, that's bad. Now I do believe in invading for oil, since war has been around for centuries. As long as that country is below third world (i.e. Somalia) I think it is ok, if the country is semi-developed (Iraq) that's a bad move. It will strengthen our economy, if soldiers wish not to go off their it's their choice. Death Penalty: Less people in jail = Less money to pay, only if their complete scum with nothing to prove them innocent, and everything to prove them guilty. What do you guys think?&&&2

Why the AP's Choice to Drop the I-Word Is a Crucial Victory&&&Definitions: Alien, Immigrant, Illegal Alien, Undocumented Immigrant These related terms are often used in deliberately confusing and conflicting ways. Here is a set of definitions that will help you sort out the difference. IMMIGRANT: In popular usage, an "immigrant" is generally understood to be a person who migrates to another country, usually for permanent residence. Under this definition, therefore, an "immigrant" is an alien admitted to the U.S. as a lawful permanent resident. The emphasis in this definition is upon the presumptions that (1) the immigrant followed U.S. laws and procedures in establishing residence in our country; (2) he or she wishes to reside here permanently; and (3) he or she swears allegiance to our country or at least solemnly affirms that he/she will observe and respect our laws and our Constitution. ALIEN: By contrast, an "alien" is generally understood to be a foreigner -- a person who comes from a foreign country -- who does not owe allegiance to our country. ILLEGAL ALIEN: An "illegal alien" is a foreigner who (1) does not owe allegiance to our country; and (2) who has violated our laws and customs in establishing residence in our country. He or she is therefore a criminal under applicable U.S. laws. The term "illegal alien" is used by U.S. citizens who believe that non-citizens entering our country must comply with our immigration laws. The term "illegal alien" is predicated upon U.S. immigration law which requires foreigners entering the U.S. to comply with our country's rules and laws regarding entry into, and residence within, our country. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT: The term "undocumented immigrant" is an oxymoron (the parts conflict). An immigrant is synonymous with "permanent legal resident." The old term for the document authorizing a permanent legal resident is "green card." The term "undocumented" is derived from the accurate term "undocumented aliens" who are often called "border crossers." Proper terms are "illegal alien" or "undocumented alien" but not "undocumented immigrant." Although not commonly used, the term "documented alien" accurately refers to foreign nationals who have an unexpired non-immigrant visa such as H-1B. Most U.S. citizens do not use the term "undocumented immigrant" and prefer, instead, the more descriptive and accurate term "illegal alien". The term "undocumented immigrant" is used by those who believe in "open borders", i.e., non-regulation of foreigners entering into and assuming residence in the U.S., including even those foreigners who owe allegiance to a foreign government and/or who may intend harm to the U.S.&&&4

But those in power currently are, I will defend against encroaching tyranny with all my might, until my last breath. I will defend my home and family, as will millions of other proud American Patriots. This current illegitimate president, regime and their legions of brainwashed followers are everything the founding fathers warned against. This message is not to spread fear. The enemies are already doing a fine job of that. I am saying here that I will not go down quietly, I will not be muzzled, and I will die a free man. I hope that there are more brave souls who wake up and do the same when the time comes. Arm up, America. Even if you can't afford a firearm, or do not care for them, get what weaponry you can, while you can. Bats, Slingshots, Spears, Bows, cocktails ... all can be bought and improvised now, and used in the fight to defend your family and home from mobs, as well as government tools of oppression. Stand and fight. Always be ready. And remember to nourish the tree of liberty should it become called for in these dark years ahead.&&&2

Seattle has fallen into a freeway system, which over the decades, has became the worst in the nation.

Sen. Paul: Voters want to round up immigrants&&&that would be costly but when you consider all the money going into paying for all the new born anchors (2 billion?) yearly?

Then HEFTY-REAL very HEFTY FINES FOR ALL THOSE HIRING ILLEGALS WHO DON'T HAVE LEGITIMATE WORKING PAPERS. This would help us to get OUR COUNTRY back and concentrate on jobs for our own citizens. I think daily RANDOM raids without warning WOULD BE IDEAL, and WITHOUT EXCLUSION OF ANY CITY. I believe this would definitely DISCOURAGE ANYMORE illegal entries. Besides isn't aren't there stories (one news piece here in El Paso) that things are looking up in Juarez and people are going back??? I certainly don't see it but it was in the news. HOPEFULLY SO.

Striking Subsidies Could Save Billions of Dollars&&&Dairy price supports cost taxpayers $1.1 billion a year. They include a quaint, but expensive, provision dating back to the 1930's called "milk marketing orders," which originally restricted how far milk could be transported from farm to market to prevent spoilage. Today, refrigerated trucking invalidates that concern. "There are fewer milk marketing orders, but they still exist," Schatz said. Another subsidy, on peanuts, costs taxpayers $55 million every year. Peanuts can be grown in a wide range of climates, but the government restricts their planting to a few, mostly southern, states. This is an example of what congress could be working on to cut spending. Representatives from any farming region that benefits from one subsidy often vote with members from another region that profits from a different subsidy. Alone, the regional interests carry little power. Together, they wield the kind of influence that has distorted market prices for more than 80 years. This is the reason they don't. Defenders of the subsidies make a strong case for their preservation. "Other governments are subsidizing their farmers at a much greater percentage than our government is, so we feel like, in order for our farmers to be able to compete worldwide, we need to have some government support," said Mary Kay Thatcher, of the American Farm Bureau Federation. In order for our farmers to be able to compete worldwide should be because our farmers are the best, in quality, in taste, in variety, most productive in the world. Instead, we have insecticide laced, antibiotic stuffed, food coloring added, processed corporate farming factories. Looking for a HANDOUT from the evil "gubmint" regulators because their "experiment" with the above failed miserably.&&&17

The Complexity of Global Warming&&&"In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a global initiative backed in part by the United Nations affirmed what many have come to believe: The earth is warming and humans play a role in this warming." The foundation of the IPCC report was tens of thousands of science papers by climatologists. The fact that it was assembled into a report by a branch of the UN is a red herring. And yes. The report clearly states that human industry is responsible for 'most' of the warming. "Moreover, Dr. Jerry R. Shubel, president and CEO of the Aquarium of the Pacific and climate change expert, says,�The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human-caused global warming is happening...� A clear statement from a scientist pointing to the 97%+ agreement within the science community. "Currently, consensus opinion seems to weight in favor of the reality of global warming." Followed by a bogus 'weak ass' confirmation that is basically meaningless. This piece is carefully crafted spin and spam that serves no purpose beyond adding a bit more mud.&&&14

how to do a fentanyl phantom 100&&&hi friends. im here today to give you all a little information about the new "euphoric tablet" as it is known when you Youtube it: fentanyl phantom 100 this new dope item is actually very good. i know the source. not the middleman, or someone who knows someone. no. im in philadelphia, and so is the underground factory that produces these. they are indeed 100% american, and not chinese of canadian like some have speculated. next. for as all the other questions regarding strength and route of administration (roa); a fentanyl phantom 100 is about the same strength as a 50-75mcg patch. because the fentanyl phantom 100 is a pill, it has a few benefits over the patch version. mainly, it can be crushed easily, which means it can be sniffed, injected and smoked. whereas the patch is not so flexible. also the patch is not that easy to find, and if you were to rely solely on finding your next patch for your opioid fix, the patch may let you down, unfortunately. the fentanyl phantom 100 seems to be much easier and cheaper to find. 3 pluses for that!+++ being that the fentanyl phantom 100 has binders in the pill that are not 100% water soluble, it means that it is best to use a cotton swab to draw up the "juice" in a needle. i have been doing this with this pill for 3 months now.&&&3

Senate's Effort to Trim Back Could Be Cut Short&&&In a nutshell�We all know obamacare was made out to sound legit at the very last second by John Roberts calling it a tax. Now there is a suit filed in D. C. that argues a tax must have originated in the House of Representatives which obamacare clearly did not. According to The US Constitution Article 1 Section 7 a bill can begin in the House and be tossed to the Senate for completion but a tax must begin as a tax in the House and cannot be turned into a tax by the Senate or by the USSC. We were told by all of 'em from the get-go obamacare was not a tax and they stuck with that until they sensed defeat coming from the USSC. This suit has a very good chance of ending obamacare because it points out clearly obamacare is unconstitutional across the board and John Roberts plucked up by trying to be a smarty pants. However with all the lawyers fighting obamacare at the USSC you�d figure one of them would have pointed out Constitutional procedure concerning taxes at the very moment the word tax came to light. Nonetheless the suit is dead serious and has teeth.&&&12

U.S. cardinal defends Catholic stance on gay marriage&&&The cardinals, and anyone who agrees with them, are WRONG ! We live in a SECULAR REPUBLIC. We have a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT and A GUARANTEE of Freedom of Religion. The Roman Catholic Church has NO MORAL RIGHT, nor LEGAL RIGHT, to impose, thru civil law, their own narrow religious beliefs ON AMERICANS WHO FREELY CHOOSE NOT TO BE CATHOLICS ! What they're doing is UN-American and IMMORAL ! But then, the Roman Catholic Churhc has never believed in Freedom Of Religion nor the separation of church and state. THIS is why the Roman Catholic Church IS EVIL ! And I would ask the Roman Catholics to explain: HOW a NON-Catholic gay or lesbian American getting married affects them in any way whatsoever ??? And while allowing gay and lesbian Americans to marry drives teh Catholic leaders crazy, they allow mafia dons Carlo Gambino and Paul Castellano to marry their own cousins in a Catholic church snd they think that is perfectly fine. I'm a church-going Christian, and each night I fall down on my knees and THANK GOD that I was born gay AND a Protestant ! I have a sister who converted from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism. I haven't spoken to her since then, and never will again.&&&35

Trayvon Martin Shooting Shows Perils of Lax U.S. Gun Laws&&&Perceived lax gun laws will not save the crime-watch guy in he end. When the facts are revealed, he may be charged. I am all-for castle doctrine and stand your ground. However in this case, it appears the self-styled crimewatch guy was following his suspect (and asking him questions), which does not make a case for 'stand your ground'. In most places, in order to be a self defence shooting, the shooter should NOT be a participant in causing the difficulty. Following somebody could easily be construed by most as participating in the problem. Town watch/community watch is supposed to be heavy on the WATCH part. I think this guy has got his ass in a sling...and probably deserves it.&&&8736

They KNOW that if we get Suspect Classification, the game would be over in all 50 States in under a year.

We've allowed ourselves to be blinded by the empty bling-bling of apparent acceptance and inclusion. Suspect Classification was the WHOLE game ....... and we fumbled the ball.&&&2

The SEALs spoke out to MailOnline after the Obama campaign released an ad entitled �One Chance�. But we are talking about some dead guys kitty cats.&&&4

House Homeland Security chair: North Korea not bluffing&&&House Homeland Security Committee GOP Peter King is right to claim that North Korean threats are real and not bluff. North Korea new regime realized that the world's power balance changed with the incompetent Obama as commander in chief which proved to be most hesitant and weakest in US history. North Korea were surprised that Obama and his pacifist 'Defense' secretary sent two B-52 aircrafts from America to fly over South Korea and come back to America without landing is proof that America will not fight back if South Korea is attacked by North Korea. North Korea could take few bases in the Korean Peninsula with Obama and Chuck Hagel doing nothing to prevent it. The American military under Obama lost its deterrent power and it is time for the American people to realize that their deceitful Emperor Obama is naked and has no clothes.&&&9

State would stand alone with abortion-coverage bill&&&Washington State should stay OUT of the baby business re funding whether it is a pregnancy, birth or abortion. I do not want one penny of my taxes supporting the right of another to have their abortion. I had two babies and paid for both. I do not support abortion and do not want my taxes to go in the direction of taking a life. We're not talking about schools, roads, bridges, gas or any other "object". I willing pay my share for such usages that support all people in this state. But abortion? We're talking about the littlest babies on earth, not roads! But maybe we are at the crossroads and it's time for Washington State to tell its people that they can have their abortions but WA taxes will not be used to support the death of life. Donna Munn&&&1

Maybe they should have asked,Since over 10,000 people are year are killed on the road in accidents attributed to speeding Do you think it is necessary for anyone to have a car like the Corvette Z1 that does 205 MPH in a nation where the speed limit is 70MPH. Or a Ford Mustang that does 155MPH? Or a Dodge Charger that does 145MPH? Should Sylvester Stallone(opposes anyone having an "AR") have a Mercedes that does 187MPH? Should anyone need a Chevy Camaro that does 185MPH? Or are you only concerned about the deaths from 30 round magazines?&&&4

TROOPER Forces woman to perform HeadJOB / Teen $1.1mil (shot in back)&&&California Parking Enforcement Officer Snatches Camera From Man Recording Him Issuing Tickets A California parking enforcement officer issuing tickets walked up to a man video recording him Wednesday and snatched his camera, telling him to �get that camera out of my face.� Nevada City parking enforcement officer Jack Ward then walked away with the phone as Tony Loro tried to take his phone back. Loro said the camera turned off during the seizure, so the rest of the interaction was not captured on video, but he said he ended up with a three-inch laceration on his hand as he tried to grab his phone back. �Go ahead, take a swing at me,� Ward told Loro, according to Loro�s detailed description of the incident, which he sent to police Wednesday and I�ve posted below. The altercation drew the attention of a district attorney deputy and eventually Nevada City Police Chief Jim Wickham, who has been on the job about a month. Man who hit cop in self-defense is acquitted, with help of friend's video footage There is an interesting story out of Northern California which hasn't received too much publicity nationally, but deserves some scrutiny. A young man who admittedly hit a California Highway Patrol officer in self-defense during a traffic stop melee has been acquitted by a jury in Northern California. The incident began when a vehicle was pulled over for allegedly running a red light. They pulled into a Circle K convenience store, and things quickly went south. The defendant was acquitted of battery against a police officer, resisting or obstructing police and public intoxication. The jury reached the not guilty verdict after only two hours of delibertaions. Victory: Unanimous Supreme Court Rules that Citizens Can Hold FEDS Liable Victory: Unanimous Supreme Court Rules that Citizens Can Hold Federal Government Liable for Abuse by Law Enforcement Officers (Police, Prison Guards) WASHINGTON, D.C.� In its ruling in Millbrook v. United States, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court has concluded that the U.S. government may be held liable for abuses intentionally carried out by law enforcement officers in the course of their employment. The Court�s ruling dovetails with arguments put forward by The Rutherford Institute in its amicus brief, which urged the Court to enforce the plain meaning of federal statutes allowing citizens to sue the government for injuries intentionally inflicted by law enforcement officers.

Proposed Indiana reservoir would face several reviews&&&I, personally, am seeing the Mounds Lake Proposal as more of a positive in the end, seeing as how both Delaware and Madison County are two of the poorest counties in Indiana, which is one of the poorest states in the U.S. I think a change of pace would encourage growth in an otherwise stagnant economy for those of us in Madison and Delaware counties. I would rather live amongst "reservoirs" than to see eventually-abandoned houses bulldozed so that new highways can pave their way THROUGH us to lead to OTHER cities of wealth and prosperity... I hope people don't shoot down this idea without thinking about the jobs and revenue this could create for all of us, without everyone having to drive to Indianapolis or other metropolises to find work. I also like the idea of a more peaceful lakeside community. The main reason I moved from my hometown of Anderson to Yorktown when I had children was because of the safety-factor of living in a small town with a predominantly "country" school. I believe that the people most angry with the proposal are obviously the ones whose homes would be effected. If productive means are obtained to accommodate these families and alleviate their worries, maybe the project would get further faster?&&&3

After dickhead is gone it might have a chance of getting straightened out and then we can dump it and go back to when we had the best healthcare instead of broke-ass socialist healthcare. I know of no-one that was denied care "ever" when I was growing up. Let's see how horrible dickheadcare is.&&&3

Democratic and Republican Senators Debate Immigration Reform&&&Does the Union AFL-CIO which are 100% Obama voters and who agree to delusional unreal salaries to the illegal invaders makes the deal for the Maverick and NY Times darling John McCain and Obama's favorite opportunist follower senator Lindsey Graham? Will the illegal invader prove paying taxes in America during at least five years or would they be Obama's 'Food Stampers' who enjoy free healthcare and free education in return for their vote for Obama? Will the illegal invaders continue to send money to their relatives in South America and will they be eligible to bring more than 40 million relatives from the Middle East and South America to live on Obama free checks in return for voting for the liberals Democrats? Will the GOP ever realize that 80-90% of the illegal invaders will continue to get food stamps and free healthcare in return for voting for Obama and the Democrats? Why is it right and fair to bring tens of millions illegal invaders from all over the world that do not want to be Americans but desire to get free food stamps, free healthcare and education an make them voters for Obama while destroying the GOP for decades and centuries? Why should the American people pay trillions of dollars to make the illegal invaders the new deciding voting bloc that decide the winner in presidential, House and Senate elections?&&&1

The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. "For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan."&&&2212

Sen. Flake Sees GOP Contender Backing Gay Marriage&&&Bringing the anti-nature and anti Religion and anti-God animalistic idea of the same sex marriage aim at destroying America as family based society and as country that is based on the Ten Commandments of the Judeo-Christian culture and no elected GOP Senator of Rep. should ever even think about supporting it. The Supreme Court and especially Judge Roberts should not go blind after the demands of dictator Obama to ruin America as a moral nation and convert it to the doggie anal cultured country. Undoubtedly, in the Sodom and Gomorrah called America there is no limit to the immorality and hatred to nature creation and adopting the animalistic culture of doggies that aimed at disintegrating society and bring the jungle rules to become the norm in America. The fact that Obama is pushing the effort to bring the immoral anti-nature and anti-God culture of anal love between sub humans to become the law of the land and to break the family structure as the pillar of the American society to bunch of singles with animalistic way of life from the jungle aimed at destruction of America as a moral nation.&&&1

Walmart�s Death Grip on Groceries Is Making Life Worse for Millions of People (Hard Times USA) When Michelle Obama visited a Walmart in Springfield, Missouri, a few weeks ago to praise the company�s efforts to sell healthier food, she did not say why she chose a store in Springfield of all cities. But, in ways that Obama surely did not intend, it was a fitting choice. This Midwestern city provides a chilling look at where Walmart wants to take our food syste ========== How 1% asset-holes� offshore tax havens hide $21 �$32 trillion McKinsey Chief Economist James Henry leads explanation in this brilliant 53-minute video tour of how the 1% hide $21 to $32 trillion in tax havens. The US top seven banks hide over $10 trillion, many top US corporations claim income losses, while the bottom 90%�s tax burden increases � in part to pay top corporations� tax refunds. Only the middle class and poor pay taxes. Since 1966, inflation-adjusted annual income for the bottom 90% of Americans increased just $59, while the 1% increased income average by $625,000, and the 1% of the 1% increased average incomes by $18,700,000 per year.&&&1

Will Congress act to stop US support for Honduras' death squad regime? | Mark Weisbrot&&&A death squad government may not be the Obama administration's first choice, but it prefers it to a leftist government that Hondurans might elect if they were to have a free election. The current government belongs to Washington, just like the US military base that the Pentagon would like to keep in Honduras indefinitely. There is your answer. If all that sounds disgusting, and reminiscent of President Reagan's death squad governments in Central America, it's because it is both. The question right now, as in the 1980s, is what will members of Congress in Washington do about it? Nothing.&&&15

How else are they going to protect themselves? With a restraining order? That worked well in exampe #2 above.. assuming that getting killed by your ex-cop husband is a good outcome... You can't get a restraining order against every low life black kid that is willing to kill you or your child for 5 bucks... So - Shoot Back! (Hard to do without a gun) Remember, when seconds count, the police will be there in minutes to call the coroner for you.

son seducing dad...&&&Hey I'm a curious 15 year old son, and I want to play around with my dads penis. I am 100% straight, but I heard that it's normal for most guys my age to experience something with a friend or brother, or even their dad or uncle. I want to try some stuff, but idk how to do it. My dad's dad died when he was 3, so he didnt really have the support, and know what to do? I live with my mom, and visit him every now and then, and it's not like I haven't talked with him about dick size, jerking off or pubes. So I feel that, we would probably let me do stuff. Anyway, I don't know how.. If you're a dad, and your son around my age or so has touched you, or seduced you, please post your legitimate story, or if you're a son my age, and have feeling toward your dad like me, and or have had sex with him, or sucked him, post your legitimate story. Help!&&&16

black magic kala jadoo issues - solutions and remedy by sri selvam siddhar&&&DR. COMMANDER SELVAMS: BLACK MAGIC SOLUTIONS Lot of People are facing a problem called black magic. Atharva Veda tells a lot about black magic and the ways to prevent black magic. First let us know what are black magic and the symptoms of black magic. Black magic is the negative use of energies and power by jealous and malicious human beings of this Kaliyuga, whose main objective is to harm or deprive others from something, or influence them to do something wrong or negative. It is the evil side of the celestial cycle or negative energies. Black Magic can be used to harm or hurt another person by performing certain acts even at a far away place - the effect of this technique can be experienced thousands of miles away. With increase of jealousy, frustration, greed, selfishness, negativity and inability to accept other's happiness & growth, the use of Black magic has become the most common way to take out one's vindictiveness and get an evil kind of satisfaction from the turmoil of others.&&&31

Neb. panel kills prenatal care repeal bill&&&(CBS) It was 5 a.m. and CBS News national correspondent Byron Pitts is with a woman who is nine months pregnant. She's rushed to a south Texas hospital to undergo a C-section - a $4,700 medical procedure that won't cost her a dime. She qualifies for emergency Medicaid. She gave birth to a healthy, 8 1/2 pound baby boy - born in America. His Mexican mother gave him an American name: Eliot. Eliot is one of an estimated 300,000 children of illegal immigrants born in the United States every year, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. They're given instant citizenship because they are born on U.S. soil, which makes it easier for their parents to become U.S. citizens. That's because those babies can eventually sponsor their parents - when they turn 21 years old. As for Eliot's mother, no longer as fearful of deportation, she told CBS News her name, Fabiola, and her story. "So your son is an American citizen. What does that mean to you?" Pitts asked. "I am very glad that he was born. That's why I came here - so my children, my husband and I could have a better life," she said through a translator. Back in December, when she was six months pregnant, Fabiola, her husband and their two daughters - ages 4 and 11 - crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico into the U.S.&&&3

Obama forms commission on long lines to vote&&&Early commission report leaked... Long lines will be eliminated by pre-printing all ballots with the appropriate choices already selected; therefore voters will be given a ballot which they put into the ballot box (a vote) or into a trash can (a non-vote). This will ensure that voting lines will be eliminated, only qualified Democratic approved candidates are elected, and voters who generally don't have a clue in the first place won't be inconvenienced with having to think, while still providing the population with the illusion that they are "participants" in the governing process. In the second year, the plan is to eliminate voting as a cost savings measure, since 100% of the votes were for King Obama. I wish the above were further from the truth.&&&8

Chicago, New York and our nation's capital are prefect examples of that. To address the issue of gun violence you MUST start with those committing the violence. Make armed violence a capital offense and enforce the punishment. Executing a murderer is no more of a cruel and unusual punishment than what was done to the victim. Put an end to the endless strings of appeals. Two convictions should be enough in any court of law these days, given the advanced technology of forensics. And get rid of that "innocent by reason of insanity" crap too. If a person commits a crime, no amount of "insanity" should absolve them and they should be put down just like a rabid dog.&&&2

Why we should have prayer in public school....but not the kind you think&&&I would like to advocate for an Islamic prayer before the beginning of each school day in public schools. So many advocates for prayer in public school assume Christian prayer but I am curious as to why that is.

New sentence for young man in sandwich shop abduction, murder&&&When this abduction first happened there was a wittness that called police to report it. They were told they were too busy. Just last week 3 police cars showed up to shoot an abandoned dog twice. The dog ran off and later retured to the yard. The police came back and shot it. Too bad they weren't too busy. A little patience and food would have worked. Instead they shot in a residential area where people could have got shot. Discusting.&&&1

GOP Senator 'Evolving' on Gay Marriage&&&This is a serious question that I would like to have answered. If same sex marriage is considered constitutional, then why can't I, a straight, have the same arrangement with a best friend in order to avoid the tax burden? I really don't understand. Pro or anti gay doesn't seem to be the real issue here. It seems that once this is opened up, where would it stop? As I said, I am not trying to bait or debate, I want to understand!&&&4

Obama celebrates start of Passover with Seder at the White House using plate from Israel&&&Obama celebrates Passover. He needs to know that the exodus never took place. Not one word in Egyptian history mentions that thousands and thousands of slaves left Egypt. A massive work force like that would leave the country devastated if they suddenly left Egypt, But also not a mention. But the Egyptians did leave an history of the Hyksos exodus 240,000 were chased out of Avaris in Egypt. In the list of those Hyksos kings that ruled in lower Egypt were two very important names. (1) Maabra, which was changed to an anagram in Hebrew bible to become Abraam. MA AB RA = AB RA AM. (2) The other king was named Yaqubel, who in Genesis chapter 50, was embalmed as a mummy, and was given a Egyptian state funeral. Does that sound like a funeral of a Hebrew slave. Obama you need to check out the facts before you start celebrating a lie. Israeli archaeologist stated that 'the Exodus never took place, he said the Hebrew scribes had a vivid imagination. see youtubethebibleunearthed&&&22

Court could avoid ruling on gay-marriage ban&&&Just reading Jeffrey Toobin's report on CNN regarding teh SCOTUS justices' questions regarding the Prop. 8 case and they seem to be VERY concerned about the standing issue. So I think it is very possible, and even most probable, that they will decide teh case on the standing issue alone, and rule that the pro-Prop. 8 supporters simply don't have standing in the case. And that may well be the correct decision.&&&63

DOMA Repeal Is Good Business for LGBT Families&&&Homosexual 'marriage' is a complete fraud. It has been overwhelmingly rejected by homosexuals as an actual practice in every country that allows it, and studies have shown that most such 'marriages' aren't even exclusive arrangements. No homosexual relationship shares the reasons for government involvement in real marriage. No child is ever born as a direct result and no such relationship can provide a child with a father and mother. Homosexual 'marriage,' where legal, isn't even a basic building block of homosexual society, much less of society as a whole. There is no standardized format for homosexual 'marriages,' and no economically unequal genders are involved. Why not forget about disenfranchising others in order for force your concocted, failed philosophy into law? Why not try a little live and let live?&&&3

If you want to restrict pollurion and noise from the area, close Sepulveda Blvd and all the other major streets from traffic and ban all the house fraus driving their oversized SUVs around GrandView School and the rest of town.

Gabby Giffords owes an apology to Jared Loughner and his family for the smear job she's done on him. In this country, people are innocent until proven guilty, regardless of the games sociopathic killers like Gabby Giffords wish to play with our citizens. It's a pity to think that if Jared Loughner did indeed do what Gabby Giffords alleges and if he would succeeded, many innocent lives would have been spared the maniacal whims of that insidious Gaby Giffords.

Unaudited drug money confiscations fuel some of the most evil covert operations imaginable from our own government,.. they are DEPENDENT on that money and secrecy it brings them. They will let the business's get enough of a bankroll safed up and then raid them and take the money and leave the plants like they always do. It is all about the money.

I wonder why that is????Our forefather's knew who they were, what they could handle and what they could not. Thus the nickname Wet.

U.S.A. in the marrying business?&&&Why is American government in the marrying business? The government should not marry people but only grant civil unions with the same legal benefits as marriage. If the government wants to continue in the business of marrying people, people of faith should qualify their marriage by calling them 'sacramental' or 'covenant' marriages. After obtaining a �sacramental� or �covenant� marriage a civil union, marriage, can be later obtained.&&&2

Disability Insurance: America's $124 Billion Secret Welfare Program&&&Is this a news story to provide me with more information that I can use to make my life better, or a story to provide hype for debates like, if we had public health care we would have fewer disabled people? Taxpayers provide millions to educate children, while allowing those with a health problem, that a working class person can not afford to see a doctor about, becomes a disabling condition. In truth, in todays society, many have a health problem that could be called disabling. That group of individuals will be the last group to find a job in our challenged economy. I believe that many of these individuals, despite having a disabling health problem would attempt employment, work with pain and limitations, if they could find a job that would allow them to survive. One of the issues for those on disability, if one has health care needs, costs, then it becomes impossible to pay for any health care, while working at a low wage, versus being on disability, which, is intended to put some food on the table, and at least pays enough to get into seeing a doctor. Once again, an argument for public health care. Truth is that business has always treated workers like disposable paper bags. Use them and when they do not suit the company purpose, throw them away. Now some want a moral outrage against those same workers, have a need to eat and have a roof over their head. If the media wants hype, where are the news stories about those individuals who caused this economic collapse being prosecuted and going to jail. Before our economic system can heal, we need to demonstrate that financial systems can be trusted. Not because we have added crippling controls to finance,(which companies will dance around) but because there is real fear that if one steals, they will suffer the consequences. Many of those who stole are now on a private golf course, plotting a comeback.&&&6

Maryland Senate passes driver's licensing bill for illegal immigrants&&&Illegal Immigration Costs Maryland Nearly $1.9 Billion a Year By PRNewswire on May 17, 2012 in immigration WASHINGTON, May 17, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/� A new study released by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) finds that providing education, health care, law enforcement, and social and government services to illegal aliens and their dependents costs Maryland taxpayers $1.86 billion. These costs amount to a $910 a year burden per Marylandhousehold headed by a U.S. citizen. The report, The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Marylanders, estimates that about 295,000 illegal aliens resided in the state as of 2010 � more than five times as many as lived there in 2000. In addition, there are some 68,000 U.S.-born children of illegal aliens living in Maryland who are eligible for all means-tested programs and benefits. Though these children are U.S. citizens, they would not be in the state if not for the fact that their parents violated U.S. immigration laws.&&&2

Lankford Is the House GOP's Unassuming Moral Compass&&&Obama has no moral compass........ As spring break begins for schoolchildren across the country, thousands of students will travel to Washington, DC. The trips, funded by bake sales and other events throughout the year, will allow the students to take in Washington's historic landmarks. One premier destination is off-limits this year, however. A few weeks ago, the Obama Administration announced it was suspending public, self-guided tours of the White House as a result of the automatic sequester cuts that the administration proposed in 2011. While America's students stand outside the White House fence, the First Daughters, Sasha and Malia, are enjoying spring break with friends at the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. Breitbart News' Matt Boyle broke the news Monday morning that numerous sources have reported seeing the First Daughters in the Bahamas this weekend. Presumably, the Obamas are paying the costs of the resort out of their own pockets. The robust Secret Service detail that must accompany the First Daughters, however, is funded by taxpayers. The principal reason the White House canceled public tours was to save money on Secret Service staff. The White House reported that suspending the tours would save $74,000 a week. Other reports have put the savings at just $18,000 a week. Whichever the true amount, the Secret Service detail necessary to protect the First Daughters on their spring break could likely have been used to keep the White House open to the rest of America's school children. Judicial Watch reported that Malia Obama's Spring Break in Mexico last year cost taxpayers over $115,000. That amount would cover 2-6 weeks of White House tours.&&&15

They begin sensing that something is amiss, and start looking for answers.

Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over ignorance. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Supreme Court takes up Mich. law banning affirmative action&&&They really need to get rid of this affirmative action stuff, it has been about 35 years since someone explained to me that the job I was not getting was going to a black person person who had a lower score than I because they were making up for past discrimination with affirmative action. The sole reason he got the job and I did not was because he was black, if I had been black I would have got the job because I scored higher on the test. Somehow it was racism when a black person (not even the one they hired) was denied the job because he was black but it was not racism when I was denied the job solely because I was white. As I say, I still remember how I felt even though it was 35 years ago. Perhaps they should not solve discrimination with discrimination unless they want it to stay around.&&&21

Philippines has tendency to unfairly exploit the law for their own gains!&&&Selfish and greedy Pinoys complain again. Filipino maids and workers want to get permanent residence status in Hong Kong. So they twist the law again and sue Hong Kong govt in court. They also have cost a lot of money of the tax payers. Just the legal assistance HK govt gave them cost more than HK$10 million.(It is just like Canada, whoever from foreign countries claims to be a political refugee and applies for political assylum, it will go through rounds of litigation and takes a lot of legal fees before the govt can deport them. That is a waste of tax money.) If Pinoys think the Philippines is so good and booming, why do they want to stay in Hong Kong by hook or by crook. Why don't they help develop their own country into a better one? If they want to be a HK person, they should go home and submit an immigation application through the proper channel. PH has a lot of land and naturally resources. HK has no land and no resources but relatively a huge population (7 million) to feed. The 300,000 Filipino overseas workers want to stay as permanent residents in Hong Kong. Many of them explicitly said if they get the PR status, they will bring in their relatives and enjoy the welfare and medical benefits of HK. They are rejected by the Court of Final Appeal. The judge said, Filipino maids have been told upfront that their work contracts and work visas are not qualified for landed immigrant status. That is very explicit,and their visas are not immigration visas. Pinoys think it is not fair. But if you look at the facts, you know they are badmouthing again. They want to win and get all the benefits. If anyone want to migrate to PH, would a work visa guarantee permanent residence there? Not in the Philippines, and not in Canada, USA, EU countries, and Australia. Work visa and labour certificates are different with different restrictions than immigration process. These advanced countries will screen their immigration applicants to make sure they fulfil the requirements (e.g. skills, wealth, education...). If an overseas worker wants to apply for immigration status, the outcome is not guaranteed. It will be on a case-by-case basis. The applicant often have to leave the country and upon successful application, he/she re-enter the country. Conversion from work visa status to immigration status is never automatic in the PH, and other advanced countries. Which country or region with 7 million people can suddenly accept 300,000 Filipinos as permanent residents? And there are more to come from PH and other countries. It is very important to let the world know that Chinese workers from mainland China working in Hong Kong won't be entitled to permanent residence either. This is very clear. Why should Hong Kong govt relax the rules to satisfy the wants of Filipino maids at the expense of the rights of Hong Kong residents and their compatriots in the mainland and Taiwan? Pinoys, keep complaining and twist the facts. You may get everything you want after doing it for a long time. You are born more equal than other people!&&&1

Cultural Diplomacy & Human Rights&&&The 2013 International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy & Human Rights "Towards a Global Human Rights Culture: The Need for a Collective Alliance in the Protection & Promotion of Human Rights" (Berlin, May 26th - June 2nd, 2013) Since its earliest inception, Human Rights have increasingly been considered to form part of what is now seen as universal law. The creation of the United Nations in 1945 subsequently provided an international regulatory framework for dialogue on Human Rights in the global sphere. Despite a global governing set of laws set forth by the formation of the UN, the international community still lacks a cohesive implementation and engagement strategy in the enforcement of Human Rights. The conference will therefore provide the platform for activists, experts, academics and world leaders involved in the field of Human Rights to come together, create alliances, and better coordinate their activities, thus promoting better implementation and enforcement of Human Rights in a more effective nature. The conference will furthermore engage Cultural Diplomacy as a means of uniting the varying sectors of society in order to create a joint collaboration for the protection and support of Human Rights activities, as well as recognize the capabilities of Cultural Diplomacy in enabling governments to fulfill Human Rights obligations towards their citizens. Symposium Participants � Participation in the conference is open to governmental & diplomatic officials, academics, artists, journalists, civil society practitioners, private sector representatives, young professionals and students as well as other interested individuals from across the world. Symposium Agenda � The conference will bring civil society and academics practitioners together with world leaders with the intention of creating global alliances and platforms for dialogue. This major assembly of Human Rights activists and experts will create a cohesive coalition of supporters with the aim of strengthening current policies while initiating new proposals in the Human Rights arena. The simultaneous sessions of the Congress will provide a unique opportunity for those involved in the field to come together and discuss contemporary obstacles and needed revisions, work collectively as a single entity, and ultimately propose alternative solutions to current impediments. Participant Papers � The Institute for Cultural Diplomacy encourages academic research and analysis of issues related to the goals of the Conference. The ICD would therefore like to welcome the participants of the conference to submit a paper they would like to be considered for presentation at the Conference as well as being included in the proposal document that will be issued following the Conference and will be sent to all governments and leaders of the international community worldwide.

Cultural Diplomacy in the Levant&&&The 2013 International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy in the Levant "Levant, Cradle of Cultural Diplomacy: Rediscovering the Mediterranean" The Conference is Co-organized and Co-hosted by the Government of Romania, the Romanian Senate, the Romanian Cultural Institute, the University of Bucharest, the Romanian Foundation for Democracy (Bucharest, May 23rd - 25th, 2013) The Levant is the crossroads of Western Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean and Northeast Africa; As such, its countries occupy a region of geographic and cultural significance. Individual countries in the Levant are interdependent and interconnected to the extent that they share both overlapping cultures and natural resources. However, the area is still prone to conflicts, which threaten the immense potential of the region as a whole. These disputes traditionally arise out of a plethora of cultural, political, religious, and economic differences across the region. The successful and long-term growth of each country depends on the stability of the region as a whole, for which de-escalation of disputes and reliable cooperation between states is paramount.

Cultural Diplomacy in the Asia Pacific&&&The 2013 International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy in the Asia Pacific "South Pacific Relations: The Application of Cultural Diplomacy in Fostering Australasian Relations" (Berlin; May 17th - 20th, 2013) Symposium Overview With the ever increasing significance of successful global and regional governance, the 2013 International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy in the Asia Pacific will focus on the challenges and opportunities that the South Pacific region faces as a potential regional power in the international community. In recognition of Australia�s role as a key power in the region, the conference will focus on how Australia, working in partnership with others in the region, can facilitate stable, cooperative initiatives in tackling the key challenges present in the area. Many of the Pacific islands are currently encountering several obstacles, such as underdevelopment, mismanagement of natural resources, lack of economic integration, and state instability, with the main challenges hindering successful Australasian relations requiring a deeper understanding and prompt action. Improving regional integration and cooperation would bring about vital benefits to the locality, such as increasing national and regional competitiveness, improving the quality of governance in the South Pacific region, and helping to achieve a convergence of key regulatory measures to ensure the promotion of interests and prosperity in the region. Symposium Agenda The overall aim of The International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy in Australia will be to build on the close historic, economic, political, and geographic links that bind the countries in the South Pacific and encourage inter-disciplinary, cross-cultural discussions on salient issues in this region, thus promoting a greater understanding across national borders, while creating a unique international platform for developing the opportunities for cooperation in this region. The Conference will focus in particular on the following areas: Trade and Investment Economic Development Regional Security and Stability Cultural and Indigenous Rights Health and Social Challenges Sustainable Development, Environmental Responsibility, and Climate Change Ocean & Fisheries Management Participant Papers The Institute for Cultural Diplomacy encourages academic research and analysis of issues related to the goals of the International Symposia on Cultural Diplomacy 2013, and would therefore like to welcome conference participants to submit a paper they would like to be considered for presentation at the symposium.

Congratulations to y'all.&&&60
Newtown's Hidden Crime-Scene Photos&&&I am against the ban of assault weapons. I have no reason to believe banning assault weapons will prevent another massacre. I haven't seen a single photo of Adam Lanza holding an assault rifle. In other shootings, still photos were released to the media and public immediately by law enforcement. I realize the sensitivity of this situation, but one still photo of the shooter would have been helpful in dispelling the rumors and conspiracy theorists' attacks. I do not need to see dead children's photos. I need to see Adam Lanza standing or moving through the school with an assault rifle in his hands. Then I will believe there is ample evidence and credibility to urgently push through and pass a portion of Feinstein's legislation. Mrs. Pozer is right. She is brave and extremely intelligent. If you want to make a change in the collective consciousness of our democracy nation of citizenry, you must be willing to set forth a convincing argument to the public. We elect our officials to protect our constitution. Denying information is not the way to put forth or push an agenda to an early conclusion. What is being hidden and why?????&&&8

Tips On Pumping Gas&&&TIPS ON PUMPING GAS I don't know what you guys are paying for gasoline.... but here in California we are paying up to $3.75 to $4.10 per gallon. My line of work is in petroleum for about 31 years now, so here are some tricks to get more of your money's worth for every gallon: Here at the Kinder Morgan Pipeline where I work in San Jose , CA we deliver about 4 million gallons in a 24-hour period thru the pipeline.. One day is diesel the next day is jet fuel, and gasoline, regular and premium grades. We have 34-storage tanks here with a total capacity of 16,800,000 gallons. Only buy or fill up your car or truck in the early morning when the ground temperature is still cold. Remember that all service stations have their storage tanks buried below ground. The colder the ground the more dense the gasoline, when it gets warmer gasoline expands, so buying in the afternoon or in the evening....your gallon is not exactly a gallon. In the petroleum business, the specific gravity and the temperature of the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, ethanol and other petroleum products plays an important role. A 1-degree rise in temperature is a big deal for this business. But the service stations do not have temperature compensation at the pumps. When you're filling up do not squeeze the trigger of the nozzle to a fast mode If you look you will see that the trigger has three (3) stages: low, middle, and high. You should be pumping on low mode, thereby minimizing the vapors that are created while you are pumping. All hoses at the pump have a vapor return. If you are pumping on the fast rate, some of the liquid that goes to your tank becomes vapor. Those vapors are being sucked up and back into the underground storage tank so you're getting less worth for your money. One of the most important tips is to fill up when your gas tank is HALF FULL. The reason for this is the more gas you have in your tank the less air occupying its empty space. Gasoline evaporates faster than you can imagine. Gasoline storage tanks have an internal floating roof. This roof serves as zero clearance between the gas and the atmosphere, so it minimizes the evaporation. Unlike service stations, here where I work, every truck that we load is temperature compensated so that every gallon is actually the exact amount. Another reminder, if there is a gasoline truck pumping into the storage tanks when you stop to buy gas, DO NOT fill up; most likely the gasoline is being stirred up as the gas is being delivered, and you might pick up some of the dirt that normally settles on the bottom. To have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of gas buyers. It's really simple to do. I'm sending this note to about thirty people. If each of you send it to at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300)...and those 300 send it to at least ten more (300 x 10 = 3,000) and so on, by the time the message reaches the sixth generation of people, we will have reached over THREE MILLION consumers !!!!!!! If those three million get excited and pass this on to ten friends each, then 30 million people will have been contacted! If It goes one level further, you guessed it..... THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE!!! Again, all you have to do is send this to 10 people. How long would it take?&&&1

Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening. Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over ignorance. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

But not to detract from Canada's accomplishment -- the Netherlands were the 1st in the world (in 2000), as they so often have been in such matters. I salute the Dutch for being the world leader in moral issues, and the Canadians for having the courage to bear Europe's torch through the North American continent, not to forget the South Africans as the first country in Africa, and Argentina as the first in South America. As usual, some of the most prominent 'christian' countries such as the US and Brittain have been conspicuous in their absence from the leadership podium. Instead they chose to hinder others wishing to step up to the plate. But history will record each nation's contribution, just as it has kept a record of who readily abolished slavery 200 years ago and who kicked against it in financial self-interest.&&&3

This guy openly carried a handgun and invited people to legally carry in his store. Guess what, he was one of only two stores that were not robbed.

Supreme Court hands President Obama a major victory on health care&&&Romney's Platform: "12 Sound Reasons to REPEAL Obamacare" No Matter what the Leftist Court stacked with 2 Political Appointees says, Obamacare Has To Go and I will REPEAL IT. So, let us count the ways that it violates basic principles of sound policy. 1. It discriminates against young people, forcing them to purchase health insurance at inflated prices in order to subsidize older beneficiaries. 2. Simultaneously, the law imposes severe penalties on young people who use Health Savings Accounts to secure health benefits for themselves in later years. 3. Already the administration has granted a long list of exemptions to various companies and unions. 4. Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services dictated that employers, including religious organizations, must cover contraception and abortion-causing drugs in their health plans. Apart from any moral objections to such provisions, why should the federal government tell employers and employees what their health insurance has to cover? 5. Good public policy would encourage health care consumers to shop around and purchase insurance policies that are best suited to their own needs and spending priorities. The health care reform bill does the opposite. Decision-making power is turned over to bureaucrats, who pay no price for decisions that are costly or wrong-headed. * Good public policy does not raise false expectations. Backers of the health reform bill violated this principle three times over. Here are those Obama LIES: 6. They promised a) anyone can "keep their plan if they like it'; FALSE. According to a McKinsey & Co. study, a third to a half of employers plan to stop offering health insurance beginning in 2014. Faced with expensive mandates and less expensive fines, many employers will choose the fines and cause their employees to move to government-sponsored plans. 7. the plan would mandate many new benefits and still reduce the average family premium by $2,500; which is clearly FALSE. Another study concludes that a typical family health insurance plan costing $12,300 today will cost more than twice that by 2019. There are no "free" mandates or other benefits -- to paraphrase Milton Friedman. 8. That it wouldn't add "a single dime" to the federal deficit. FALSE. It adds over $1.76 TRILLION to the Debt. Last October, the administration dropped the long-term care program known as the Class Program from implementation of the new law as financially unworkable. It also added $111 billion premium subsidies to its proposed fiscal 2013 budget. 9. Good public policy avoids ticking time bombs. The legislation will increase Medicaid enrollment by an estimated 24 million new users by 2015. This will put states further into Debt. 10. The law includes a massive new health entitlement/income redistribution program for families earning more than three times the poverty level. In 2014, it will channel up to $3,000 in taxpayers funds to families making up to $95,000. 11. The law is fiscally irresponsible. It includes a raft of new taxes. But these appear to be wholly inadequate to the task of paying the bill for over-promising and extending new entitlements to tens of millions of people. That leaves rationing as a last resort, and the government's own reports contemplate major cutbacks in Medicare spending down the road. 12. The Affordable Care Act is truly unaffordable� and unsustainable. Our government should not erode our freedoms, degrade our quality of life, or bankrupt our future. The health care reform bill does all those things. If it is not struck down, it should be repealed.&&&3675

In Utah we just voted in a Latino, as attorney General, and he's already dismissing cases against illegals, against the West Valley Police Dept. wishes. It's turned into a huge stink here. And Utah is just getting sick of all the drama. Racial profiling ETC. If you're illegals, commit crimes, don't cry racism. Those dismissals were drug enforcement cases and the Cops are super pissed off at the Attorney General.We never had this crap in Utah even 15-16 year's ago. But now it's in the news everyday....&&&12

Forty percent of Hispanic teens are in gangs. Who needs this? Why are we kissing their asses? They don't even vote! 71% of what?!! They act as if they alone elected Obama. Truth is the liar in the white house is going to make his demands for immigration reform so obnoxious to even democrats, the whole immigration reform discussion will die and the Hispanics, legal ones and scumbag illegal aliens, will see their dreams explode.

Funny how left wing dirtbags like timmy lament about our "irrational" desire to own firearms but never question raise the question why in a nation where the speed limit is 70MPH who would need a Corvette Z1 that can do 205 MPH. Acccording to NHTSA there were over 30,000 deaths on the road in 2011. Out of those more than 10,000 were attributed to speeding.It's safe to say a good percentage of those 10,000 were school aged kids. Where is the "who would need crowd"....you know...who would need a magazine that holds 30 rounds. Why is it we never hear why anyone would need a Ford Mustang=155 MPH Dodge Charger=145 Chevy Camaro=185 Then of course there is Porsche and Nissan and Masseratti. Merceds has a model that does 187. A car that does 70-80 mph is designed for transportation,one that does 140 plus is designed for speeding. Not everyone with one of these cars speeds just like not everyone with a semi automatic and a 30 round magazine shoots up a school.&&&3

It shows clearly that man has lost his senses and man is no longer a thinking being as he used to be.

COP Ordered to Harass With Blacks / Chased Down-Abused for Filming&&&Police Chase Down Man For Filming Police Abuse, Enter His Home Police officers in Omaha, Nebraska were caught on tape violently arresting a man over a parking dispute by grabbing him by his neck in a choke hold and flipping him over slamming him on the ground. The man, 28-yr-old Octavius Johnson, did not appear to be resisting, and the officer grabbed him from behind and choked and slammed him seemingly without warning. As the abuse is taking place, the victim's brother, Juaquez, who is understandably in a state of shock pulls out his cell phone to record the police's actions, after a minor tussle with one of the officers, he is finally let go to film the incident from the sidewalk across the street from the action. Throughout the incident Juaquez is vocally voicing his displeasure with the way the police are abusing his brother, which apparently gets one of the cops quite angry. Eventually, after facing a lot of hostility from one of the officers, and faced with an army of police showing up for "backup," Juaquez decides to run away from the scene into his own home. Amazing, the same angry cop decides to chase Juaquez into his own home! The army of police who just showed up as backup decide to swarm into the Johnson's home as well! The cops allegedly knocked over the Johnson's wheelchair bound aunt in the process, yet they claimed in their report it was Juaquez who knocked her over, which his aunt vigorously denies. While the cops are in the Johnson's house, the cop who is holding down Octavius is seen taking a few pot shots on the grounded man. The cops eventually pull Juaquez out of his own house, then arrested him for "obstructing," as well as having an unrelated outstanding warrant. Fortunately, this whole incident was caught on tape by ...(more) Resistance is Dangerous; Submission is Frequently Fatal 13-Year-Old Witness Told to "Pick the Guy With the Biggest Nose,� By Police, Sending Innocent Man to Prison for 2 Decades Mother sues Lauderhill over son's fatal shooting by police Stop-and-frisk trial: Cop's secret tape reveals boss ordered him to target blacks males ages 14 to 21 Pittsburgh, PA officer's alleged on-duty exc force �strikingly similar� to incident involving same officer 3 yrs ago Baltimore, MD officer accused of taping a judge without her consent; prosecutors say violation of MD's wiretap laws New Hanover Co, NC deputy terminated, internal investigation revealed violated 3 sheriff's office policies&procedures Towson, MD officer charged with DUI, removed from his position and placed on administrative duty Nashville, TN deputy charged in federal complaint with conspiring to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine Update: Irving, TX troopers involved in roadisde cavity search indicted, chrgd: sexual assault, official oppression Cleveland, OH US Justice Department announced investigation into possible excessive force/misconduct by police&&&1

House votes to end guaranteed pension benefits&&&I predict that the state, counties and school boards will have a very difficult time recruiting employees starting next year, because with the very low salaries they pay, the pension and insurance made up for the crappy pay. With Obamacare starting next year, the state will no longer have a superior insurance plan over competitors for talent anymore, so it will be no better than a job at Walmart. Then the GOP will privatize more functions, saying that they have no choice since nobody wants to work for the state anymore.&&&3

Roll call: How Erie-area members of Congress voted&&&. . . Here's how area members of Congress voted in the week ending Friday. . . .

The Bernanke Fed has also modified its guidance, noting its ultra-accommodative stance will remain in place until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5% and inflation projections remain no more than half a percentage point above 2% two years out. .......... obummer, a four year failure budget plan ha,ha,ha,ha, ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha, ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha, ha,ha,ha&&&1

What are Romney's policies?&&&AKA The Human Windsock: I've decided to take one firm policy stand since It concerns the only real thing I know how to do. Please disregard the dozen or so promises I've made to do "on day one". We always knew they were lies anyway but figured you dummies would buy it all and they would be good for a few weeks of polling! I know huh, it worked, even I didn't believe I could be this close in the polls! Anyway, the new policy I will stand by and do my first year? I'm going to lay off the whole of the US Government and outsource everything to Costa Rica. Here's how it works: C/R call center message: Please listen to all options as the menu changes constantly, on the half hour. Please make a special note, if what you're calling about isn't connected to a computer, we cannot help you. Also, the call center doesn't handle complaints, for those please call Swiss Mitt's hotline or Carly Fiorini personally. Option 1: If you are having pain with your trash barrels. Please note, the bottomless barrels are a feature and not a bug, since your garbage no longer actually goes anywhere, Mitt figured you could let it pile up on your property. Additionally, since we ourselves live in mountainous heaps of garbage slums as our US outsourcing only pay 35 cents an hour, we don't GAS about your garbage so please don't ask for sympathy. Option 2: If you would still like to purchase a China manufactured fancy "Made In USA" bumper sticker for your barrel. Option 3: If you're stuck in a massive sinkhole (not a swiss Mitt cash-hole, they are different) on the highway. Please note, tuff sh*t. Option 4: If you would like to delete all avenues for Women's healthcare in the US. Option 5: If option 4 is chosen first. This is to purchase China made Bayer Aspirin for your Girlfren to put between her legs for Contraception. Option 6: This is to purchase China made Clothes Hangers for when your Girlfren's first Contraception choice fails and she is at risk of dying because she cannot physically deliver your baby for you. Option 7: Use this option to purchase your new Costa Rican Wife after options 4, 5 and 6 have been exhausted and your Girlfren is dead. Option 8: Please use this option to dump any unwanted cash into any one of my off-shore bank accounts, you're too uneducated to do anything with it so you might as well give it all to me, hahahahahahahahahaha, just kidding, no I'm serious! As mentioned please check back on the half hour as the menu options are a moving target and will never be the same twice. Have a great day idiot Swiss Mitt suckers!!!!&&&11

Key US decision on Cuba terror-designation coming&&&There will probably be some momentum when the Americans allow the Cuban 5 to have a FAIR retrial, as The UN has requested for many years, as well as many, many, European, South and Central American, and other Country Leaders, have asked for. The Alan Gross affair, amongst many other American infractions, also comes into play here. What reasons otherwise, would it be to Cuba's advantage, to worry about ANYTHING that the US has to offer. Cuba has established trade relations with countries all over the world that can (and do) supply their needs. Now that South American countries are on the cusp of expanding world trade, with their burgeoning economies', and their ability to supply Cuba's needs (in a friendly manner instead of calling them a terrorist nation, and placing a 50 + year embargo on them). South America alone, has a population of 387.5 million people, and has chosen to join Africa instead of North America or Europe, as its free-trade partner. United States has indeed, shot itself in the foot, with its extremely aggressive, world-domination policies. Just remember, US Government, you catch more flies with sugar, than you do with salt.&&&7

The Bats eat insects like mosquito's who feed off of spirochetal infected animals and get infected with the gene sharing stealth that is the real cause of AIDS immune suppression and the real PRION all lied about for over 35yr.s since they infected us all with it in contaminated vaccines. The bee's get theirs from fertilizers made from fecal waste. Because they KNEW in 1985 when they infected us all- prion spirochetal proteins were Immortal. They cannot be killed. They use what ever DNA they need to survive. It is also the cause of Morgellons in the masses of people suffering their syndromes and most don't even know it yet. And it is the cause of All syndromes/psych/cancers today. But they intend to prosecute like they did Big Tobacco back in the day for causeing cancers that Tobacco never caused.

Average for US jobless claims at fresh 5-year low&&&Washington (CNN)-- While Republican Party leaders are knee-deep in mea culpas and issuing public floggings over election-year losses, they are heaping hosannas on the governors and statehouses out in the red states of middle America and the South. That praise is well-deserved. In places such as Alabama, Idaho, Louisiana and Wisconsin, Republicans control the governor's mansion and the legislature. In all, 30 of the nation's 50 governors and 28 of the country's legislatures are Republican. GOP has power where it counts: The states "Republican governors are America's reformers in chief," the report continued. "They continue to deliver on conservative promises of reducing the size of government while making people's lives better. They routinely win a much larger share of the minority vote than GOP presidential candidates, demonstrating an appeal that goes beyond the base of the party."&&&12
Arkansas adopts US's most restrictive abortion law&&&The law will never go into effect as it clearly crosses the constitutional line drawn by the court years ago.

This is how the democrats maintained control of the senate last election, they simply pointed their fingers at the republicans who made stupid statements over abortion and that was all it took.&&&31

Colorado's congressional GOP fractured on immigration&&&A second law that must be demanded by THE PEOPLE is the mandatory E-Verify (H.R. 140) provision as part as the Save Act. E-Verify are increasing in its success rate, by connecting with State Department Vehicles and able to check a workers eligibility to work in the United States. This must be an imperative law to finally stop employers from hiring illegal aliens and being held accountable for cheating American workers, unless mitigating circumstances are involved. There should be no excuse for not revising the hundred billion dollar annual cost of Birthright Citizenship for babies smuggled unknowingly passing agents of the government to gain citizenship. Its become a very lucrative business for people in foreign countries, sending pregnant women to America, to intentional gain citizenship for their children. The 14th amendment was included for slaves and there decedents, not for illegal aliens and it should be visited by the Supreme Court to clear up this chaos. The cost is too steep as it leads to such legislative bills as the DREAM ACT, FAMILY UNIFICATION and in time SANCTUARY CITIES. Using this route “Anchor Babies” as citizens in most cases inherits for the Mother a green card, which can then sponsor other family members. The more babies the mother has, which can be considerable, in the way of public benefits and entitlements for each child. In conclusion its time for a new form of national ID, instead of everything based on the Social Security number that has been greatly abused. ID theft is rampant and hundreds of thousands of people find themselves without a credit card, personal data, employment as some criminal has accessed their private information. A mandated Identification card is the best answer to theft and a whole list of different positive reasons. With this plastic card containing your picture, thumb print and even a retinal scan, it will be difficult for anybody to forge it. The penalty for counterfeiting should be a term in prison and not just a fine. The same ID cards could also be used as a countrywide verification for people voting. Because of the lax regulations of the “right to vote Act” relying on a persons integrity and the threat of being prosecuted for perjury stating they are an American citizen, committing voter fraud doesn't seem to deter non-citizens from voting as its been illustrated after the presidential elections. It is my contention that Voter fraud” was prevalent in specifically Liberal States, counties and city precincts. Right now congressional Representatives, the President are on the verge of giving a path to citizenship to people who broke our immigration laws. Our best hope to at least give no ground of any kind is to fight back by calling your politician at the Central Washington phone number at (202) 224-312.. LEARN THE VERACITY OF OUR BORDERS AND RESEARCH THE HIDDEN NEWS AND REPORTS AT AMERICANPATROL. ALSO SIGN THE PETITION AT NUMBERSUSA. Splash your Senator or Congressional House with post cards, demanding they stop the current path of overpopulation and Balkanization. Bombard Facebook and Twitter with information, as the other side do. Contact your local press and TV station, because the end is near for commonsense and also another hit on the hurting taxpayer. However the best avenue to get results is to directly phone your person in Congress via the aide and leave your argument against illegal immigration, a demand for the real wall, e-verify, repealing illegal aliens children gaining citizenship and of major importance a nation ID card for every citizen and legal resident.&&&42

Rand Paul: Getting it right on immigration reform&&&"We are not going to deport 11 million people". How many times has this phrase been used? My question is: Who ARE we going to deport? Besides falsifying deportation statistics, the Obama admin has come up with multiple exemptions for who should not be deported, while saying they will focus on criminals. But identity theft, DUI, tax fraud, sexual assaults, are no longer crimes IF you are here illegally. And the criminals they actually have detained are now being released back into our communities. Morton and Napolitanno should be removed from office. They are a disgrace to their Cabinet positions, and the President should Impeached. All three have failed to uphold the Oath of Office, to defend this nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic, and uphold its laws.&&&3

During the Cuban Missile crisis. Having read over the rest of Kerry's credits, I think, in the best interest of the country, he should have faced a firing squad somewhere around late 1969. Is there a Bronze Star or Purple Heart for spilling ketchup on the grid iron? Leave it to Obama to select yet another Bozo the Clown to represent America. I'd almost wager, if I believed in ghosts, that Ol' Benjamin Franklin is spinning in his grave at such a buffoon being appointed to represent this once grand country. I was 16 when I moved to Illinois, 2 years before Oblunder was born. I lived there until 2006 when I retired and got out of that God forsaken Liberal cesspool of a state. Watching Obama rise up out of that French Drain only served to show the ignorance, the stupidity, gullibility that inhabits Chicago and its environments. More than 4 million Obamanites in the greater Chicago area sent Obama off to Washington where he wallowed up to his neck in the sewage of Washington politics. All hail Obama! Even at this late stage of life, I find it hard to comprehend the stupidity of the people that elected Obama, someone, that by his own words, claimed to have been born in Kenya.&&&2

McCain and Schumer heading to Arizona border&&&Visiting the border is not going to change a thing. The die has long been cast; the borders will be sealed off in a few months. And if some Republicans were to have their way, not even migrating birds from Mexico will be able to scale the US border fence. Politicians are swaying back and forth because they want to be on the good sides of voters from both sides of the political divide. America will be better-off not imitating British isolationist stance that is currently pulling the UK away from the rest of Europe. I think we all need to read this book �Evicted from My Space� to learn a little more about our changing environment, immigrants and how they are viewed by their hosts. Maybe this way we might learn to listen to the message carried in the wind of change.&&&2
John Moore/GettyKids Crossing the BorderIllegal immigration may be...&&&when these kids have killed in their homelands and belong to gangs,willing to say and do anything just like their parents,what fool takes their words for why they are here? this is another trick con hustle. we cannot take in the whole world and we know some of these kids could be harden killers. let me guess we will now be robbed to pay for their lawyers as well our gov refusing to to charge their homelands for the bills. best don't waste time talking to them turn them around to where they came. i for one see kids doing this as booby traps and a way for their parents or other relatives to use to slither here.&&&8

People are not stupid enough to believe that the working class caused the financial fiasco in Ohio and the US. Jobs are currently being lost under Kasick for State employees. Our agency just laid off and is doing so again at the end of the year. Every job lost is less revenue going to the State and more being paid out in unemployment, assistance etc. Kasick isn't about creating jobs for the middle class poor; he's about creating jobs for his cronies who make 140+k a year. He's about himself.&&&2351

Leonard Pitts Jr.: Moral courage to look outside&&&Supporting equal marriage rights for gay and lesbian Americans IS, and SHOULD BE, a "conservative value". It is the Democrats and liberals, and their assorted wingnut cohorts and minions that want to micromanage Americans' lives (NO big sodas in New York according to liberal minion Bloomberg !)(the courts have recently sensibly put a stop to that nonsense, at least temporarily, as Emperor Bloomberg is appealing the court's decision). Conservatives often claim that they adhere to the U.S. constitution more than the dems and libs, yet one of the most important guarantees our U.S. constitution provides is Freedom Of Religion. And now many religious denominations, and other religious groups disagree on the issue of marriage equality. So favoring one religious group's view of marriage, is a direct violation of teh First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion. We should desire the most diverse and vibrant society, if we are to celebrate the U.S. Constitution's GUARANTEE of LIBERTY, a word too seldom heard nowadays. Equal marriage rights for ALL Americans, gay and lesbian Americans included, is fundamantally a conservative value.&&&7

The buzzword is ... drones [Bristol Herald Courier, Va.]&&&All this does is prove the corruption going on in Russell County years which is thier known reputation. They should take the money for drones and spend it on jobs in Russell County and Recreation for the teens, families to prevent crime. They do not want families in this county they want a retirement community. The sheriffs dept promotes profiling. They do not want to go out on their own and violate people they want to profile look up records and show up at their door. I am for crime prevention. Someone needs to care about the community make it grow and keep our children, granchildren here. No industry wants to stay here what can their children do for activity if they move here. One day all of the retirees will no longer be around. our children, their children -- Where are the hometown community roots. It is all about corruption and destruction of what use to be a carind meaningful place to live. Drones are an invasion of privacy act which is federally regulated. If they want drones let them join the military. Are we a country of the U.S. or are we turning into a carelesss communist community.&&&8

The military is going to have to draft people soon because they don�t have the numbers they need. Don�t you think we would have gotten out of the countries where we are hated by now, if our corrupt political-military leaders weren�t determined to stay for a long time? If you think your parents are going to work to stop it, to save your life, then ask yourself what they�ve done to fight Republican treason, or fight to prosecute legal criminals like judges, attorneys, etc. Joining the Coast Guard or National Guard won�t keep you from being sent to Afghanistan. There will be violence in America�s streets and you may be ordered to fire into crowds of protesters. If you are on duty in the U.S., are you willing to shoot people who are desperately trying to survive, and save their country too? Are you willing to shoot peaceful protesters who won�t disperse, just because they�re an embarrassment to corrupt politicians? THIS is the time to make those decisions.

US: Israel must recognize changed Mideast dynamics&&&DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.......... The Civilized World of FED UP! �Israel's Future: a Worldwide Boycott, Isolation and Castigation� EXCERPT �When was the last time that you didn't read or hear that Israel was threatening to attack Iran and its nuclear facilities, and that it was trying to involve the U.S. government? By now, the entire world is sick and tired of listening to Israel's ultra aggressive Prime Minister, Bibi Netanyahu, beating the drums of war. The nations of the world have witnessed the behavior and actions of Israel for many decades and the majority of them now find it to be completely unacceptable. And, because a great many of these nations believe that the unjustified and highly aggressive actions of the Israeli government against the people of Palestine and its neighbors in the Middle East are getting out of control, a movement to initiate boycotts, divestments and sanctions against Israel is well underway and is growing in scope and intensity.� CONTINUED ----- AND Israel's Pitiful Handfull of Paid, Full Time Propagandists HAVE FAILED! �No Amount Of Hasbara Could Beautify Israel �s Ugly Face� EXCERPT �Israeli hasbara doctors and their mouthpieces in the West don�t stop dithering about the perceived failure of the Israeli propaganda machine �to get the message through� to western audiences. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year and the best of the best PR firms are recruited to do the job for Israel. However, Israel �s image remains dark and ugly as many Europeans and others are drifting away from Israel as the outgoing British ambassador to Israel affirmed recently. Of course, the failure of Israel�s lying machine to get the message through has little or nothing to do with any presumed inefficacy of the lies themselves. After all, the Israelis have been professional liars since time immemorial and very few people under the sun could possibly outmatch them in this dishonorable field.�CONTINUED&&&19

Did Obama's charm offensive in Israel work?&&&Oh yes, he said, all the words the Zionist would like to hear. And as for controlling nuclear weapons etc., he forget one thing - God El Shaddai is in charge not him. It is El Shaddai that is in control and no one one will thwart is plans. And nuclear weapons is not one of them. He fears not. The zionists shout loud and clear about God giving them the land of Israel - stressing all of it. Yet they have not got one ounce of faith, they think men are stronger than El Shaddai. You can collate all the earth's billions of people and to try and stop El Shaddai will from being achieved, but they will be likened to an ant standing on the tracks trying to stop an express train at full speed. He gave the promise to Abram, and he will hand the deeds over to the meek of the land after Armageddon has destroyed the unrighteous. And I am talking here about the earth being rocked to and fro, the sun going down at noon, and Tsunamis spewed up out of the sea, history is getting ready to repeat itself. The flood of Noah (or originally Ziusudra will come like a thief in the night. It has nothing to do with Nuclear weapons. Obama has no insight he is a lip server. Remember El Shaddai said they honour me with their lips, but their heart is far removed from me.&&&5

If N.Y.C Judge Drager Assists Litigant To Commit Bankruptcy Fraud Is it a Crime?&&&Questions To the FBI And New York Lawmakers About Judge Laura Drager's Assisting and Enabling a Powerful and Rich Male Litigant's to Filing a Fraudulent Bankruptcy Petition? My Question to the FBI and Lawmakers is: 1. If Judge Drager was given a notrarized 'sworn to" federal document stating definitively that the male litigant is "parking" $750,000 in someone elses name, 2. and Judge Drager also knows that the male litigant had/has another $500-700,000 in cash from selling artwork deliberately excluded from the Male Litigant's Net Worth Statement submitted to Judge Drager Court, 3.and the Male Litigant owns a company with 5 offices around the world as per Bloomberg Business Week, 4. and the Male Litigant owns two Mercedes Sports Cars and a Race Care Which Was Purchased right before declaring bankruptcy, 5.and the Male Litigant also buys $100,000 Benz during the Bankruptcy, 6.and the Male Litigant Spent Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars vacationing with a friend in South Beach Florida, and skiing in the Alps and partying all over the world prior and during the Bankruptcy and Judge Drager knew about it 7. and the Male Litigant Spent thousands of dollars starting a new company by diverting funds from the original company of which the wife was 50% Shareholder and a company which she primarily financed, 8. and the Judge Drager knew that the Male Litigant unlawfully pocketed/stole $2 million of his wife's Court Ordered Money from her eviction fire sale of her apartment, in a separate room at the closing with all of the Judge Drager Lawyers in attendance including the Judge's most favorite crooked lawyer Raoul Felder, while Judge Drager threw an innocent Mom and three shell-shocked children out onto the street for a mere $17,000 in maintenance costs on a virtually mortgage-free apartment, which the first Judge said should be remedied by taking out a simple home-equity loan, 9. and Judge Drager knew that the "male litigant" had conservatively $4-5 million in cash on hand while filing a Federal Bankruptcy Petition, where his primary creditors were his 90 year old mother, his sister, his brother-in-law and his pool guy, and the debt was for at most $75,000 10. and Judge Drager had statements in Chinese showing that the male litigant had moved even more money to China and had Chinese Bank Accounts 11. and Judge Drager was given a copy of the "male litigants" hand-written diaries stating a good portion of his deals that closed during the time he filed a fraudulent bankruptcy petition, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars of which the "male litigant" became very rich 12. and Judge Drager Orchestrated an arrangement with Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to tank the "female litigant's" claims in the bankruptcy by not filing documents on time, irrespective of the fact that Gibson Dunn represented the "male litigant's" business partners while representing the wife, so Judge Drager could eliminate 3 years of unpaid child support, 5 years of all Court Ordered expenses, in the next Court Date 13. and Judge Drager worked on behalf of the "male litigant" by calling the Bankruptcy trustee and Bankruptcy Judge to lobby on the "male litigants" behalf, even though the "male litigant was Filing a Fraudulent Federal Bankruptcy Petition and Committing Bankruptcy Fraud... My Question to the FBI is...Has Judge Laura Drager Committed a Crime? If the FBI could let me know an answer to my question, it would be appreciated. Thank you&&&1

Single Dad and 7 Year Old Son Need YOUR Help!&&&I am a 28 year old Single Dad, facing multiple problems at this point in my life. I have always been a nice, helpful guy, and have done what I could to help others before myself. Now, I'm reaching out for help. This is my last resort. I am currently $1000 behind on Rent, and facing eviction. My landlady has been working with me (payment arrangements, etc) since October, and I just can't seem to catch up. I am also facing disconnection of my Electricity, due to a $300 past due bill. What really seems to be setting us back the most, is my lack of a license and vehicle. Back in 2005, I got in to an accident while driving without insurance (because I couldn't afford it), and still owe on damages. I am stuck in a low paying job as a result of this, only because it is local. At this point, it is not a matter of time to get my license back; it is a matter of money. I need $4000 simply to get my license back. Once I get my license back, I should be able to get a used car nearby. This would really help get our life back on track. I miss being able to travel to a better job, with better pay. I mostly miss being able to bring my 7 year old son to the playground, or wherever we wanted to go. Nowadays, we can't do much, and have to sit at home. To make matters worse, my GF (who lives an hour away) just had to have a major surgery, and I could not be there for her, for the surgery or to help her while recovering. I hate feeling powerless and helpless in these situations. $1000 Needed to catch up on Rent $300 Needed for Electric Bill $4000 Needed for license, and would get our life fully on track again. Please help my son and I get back on track. We will be forever grateful. God Bless You all, for ANY help that is given. supernova (at) psend dot com&&&1

Study of Men�s Falling Income Cites Single Parents&&&WASHINGTON � The decline of two-parent households may be a significant reason for the divergent fortunes of male workers, whose earnings generally declined in recent decades, and female workers, whose earnings generally increased, a prominent labor economist argues in a new survey of existing research. David H. Autor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that the difference between men and women, at least in part, may have roots in childhood. Only 63 percent of children lived in a household with two parents in 2010, down from 82 percent in 1970. The single parents raising the rest of those children are predominantly female. And there is growing evidence that sons raised by single mothers �appear to fare particularly poorly,� Professor Autor wrote in an analysis for Third Way, a center-left policy research organization. In this telling, the economic struggles of male workers are both a cause and an effect of the breakdown of traditional households. Men who are less successful are less attractive as partners, so some women are choosing to raise children by themselves, in turn often producing sons who are less successful and attractive as partners. �A vicious cycle may ensue,� wrote Professor Autor and his co-author, Melanie Wasserman, a graduate student,�with the poor economic prospects of less educated males creating differentially large disadvantages for their sons, thus potentially reinforcing the development of the gender gap in the next generation.� The fall of men in the workplace is widely regarded by economists as one of the nation�s most important and puzzling trends. While men, on average, still earn more than women, the gap between them has narrowed considerably, particularly among more recent entrants to the labor force. For all Americans, it has become much harder to make a living without a college degree, for intertwined reasons including foreign competition, advancements in technology and the decline of unions. Over the same period, the earnings of college graduates have increased. Women have responded exactly as economists would have predicted, by going to college in record numbers. Men, mysteriously, have not. Among people who were 35 years old in 2010, for example, women were 17 percent more likely to have attended college, and 23 percent more likely to hold an undergraduate degree. �I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out �You need more education� and have been able to respond to that, and men have not,� said Michael Greenstone, an M.I.T. economics professor who was not involved in Professor Autor�s work.�And it�s very, very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not. It�s a fact in need of an explanation.� Most economists agree that men have suffered disproportionately from economic changes like the decline of manufacturing. But careful analyses have found that such changes explain only a small part of the shrinking wage gap. One set of supplemental explanations holds that women are easier to educate or, as the journalist Hanna Rosin wrote in �The End of Men,� because women are more adaptable. Professor Autor writes that such explanations are plausible and �intriguing,� but as yet unproven. He disagrees entirely with the view of the conservative analyst Charles Murray, in �Coming Apart,� that men have become �less industrious.� �We�re pretty much in agreement on most of the facts,� Professor Autor said of Mr. Murray.�But he looks at the same facts and says this is all due to the failure of government programs, eroding the commitment to working. And we�re saying, what seems much more plausible here is that the working world just has less and less use for these folks.� (cont'd)&&&2

Satanic Watchtower Society HOAX EXPOSED&&&Later this month, the Satanic Watchtower has a "special" event planned, and they've begun a campaign to invite people to join them. This "event" is so "special" to them, that they've agreed to hold it on the WRONG DATE! But what can you expect from an organization that has members who saw Satanic activity, INSIDE their organization, WITH THEIR OWN EYES, coming from their headquarters, but were convinced to keep quiet about it. That's a really sad story. But entirely true. And the names and dates, as presented at the website... ...can all be easily verified. The people involved with assisting Satan to keep his Watchtower OWNERSHIP a carefully guarded secret, are still, as of this date, on guard, still keeping quiet about this matter. They're even willing to keep knowledge of this Satanic disaster away from their own fellow "Brothers" and "Sisters", even though they smile warmly at them. It's time to empty the Watchtower of it's UNSUSPECTING members. So, PLEASE, if you know any Watchtower members, or anyone thinking about associating with them, alert them to the information found at the website. It's time to empty the Watchtower.&&&7

Does Crime Drop When Immigrants Move In?&&&Immigrants or Illegal Aliens, there is a difference! "Immigration refers to the movement of people between countries.

Immigration across national borders in a way that violates the immigration laws of the destination country is termed illegal immigration." "Illegal immigration refers to immigration across national borders in a way that violates the immigration laws of the destination country. Under this definition, an illegal immigrant is a foreigner who either has illegally crossed an international political border, be it by land, water, or air, or a foreigner who has entered a country legally but then overstays his/her visa.

ALLVOICES: Music Industry and Piracy Law � Black Hawk Mines&&&The music industry has given a judicious endorsement to European Union moves intended at limiting Internet piracy. The copyright directive was "a workable proposal", said the industry's umbrella group, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries. IFPI, representing around 1400 major and independent record companies worldwide, said the newly-adopted UK legislation, requiring measures from ISPs to curb piracy on their networks, sets a powerful example to other countries. IFPI chairman John Kennedy said: "The passing of the Digital Economy Act in the UK recognizes that if a country is to have world-class creative industries, then it also needs laws that will effectively protect their rights from the crippling problem of digital piracy. "The new UK legislation is a decisive step towards dealing with P2P and other forms of illegal distribution in a way that can substantially reduce the problem. Most importantly, it recognizes that effectively addressing piracy needs active cooperation from internet service providers, in helping curb infringements on their networks. "The move by the UK creates momentum for the graduated response approach to tackling piracy internationally. Governments increasingly understand that, in the digital economy, creative industries like music, film, books and games can drive growth and jobs for many years to come if they are provided with the right legal environment and with a modern system of enforcement in which ISPs actively cooperate. "The UK has today joined the ranks of those countries who have taken decisive and well-considered steps to address the issue. We hope this will prompt more focus and urgency for similar measures in other countries where debate is underway." "There are enough elements here for the music industry to speed up the offering of music to consumers in a wider range of ways," IFPI Chairman Jay Berman said soon after the result was announced. "The directive recognizes that copyright is an essential part of the Information Society." With members made up of more than 1,400 record producers and distributors in over 70 countries IFPI represents the recording industry worldwide. "We appreciate all the work the European Parliament has put into making it possible for our companies to do business. This will be to the benefit of artists and consumers alike," Berman said. This has become vague problem for the music industry; it will make their profits go down. This draft proposal permits rights' holders in the music and film industries to prevent illegal replication of their works using advanced technology. "Authors, performers, producers and broadcasting organizations will in principle enjoy exclusive rights regarding the reproduction, communication and dissemination of their work," this is what under the text of the directive. However, individual European countries have their own exceptions or limitations to the rules. The limitations include when they regard to it to be in the public interest. An example is to assist certain categories of people, such as the disabled, and reproduction for press purposes. Nevertheless in several instances the exceptions will be on the circumstance that the copyright holder receives fair compensation and in others that the source, including the author's name, is indicated. Private individuals can produce a copy as long as it is solely for private use and non-commercial use. This is an amendment designed to strike a balance between the rights of artists and the public.

Texas authorities identify missing Oklahoma teen killed in attempted robbery&&&Middle School Suicide Of 8th Grade Student Reported At Davidson Middle School In Southgate, Michigan (UPDATE) Posted: 03/21/2013 11:48 am EDT | Updated: 03/21/2013 7:28 pm EDT An eighth-grade student brought a gun to school on Thursday and committed suicide, according to officials. Fire department officials told reporters that the student died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly in a bathroom, at the Southgate school early Thursday morning. Davidson Middle School officials put the school on lockdown and contacted parents around 9:15 a.m. to pick up their children, saying at first that the school had a "police situation." WXYZ officials said that some children looked "visibly upset" when exiting the school. According to WDIV, Southgate Schools Superintendent William Grusecki said the boy did leave a note. Michigan Department of Education Jan Ellis, said Thursday that it is rare for a suicide to occur inside a public school and added she wasn't sure one had ever occurred in MIchigan before Thursday, according to the Detroit News. In Detroit, a seven-year-old boy died as a result of an alleged suicide last May. UPDATE 4:05PM: According to the Detroit News, the 14-year-old boy shot himself in the head with a .40 caliber Glock before classes started at 8 a.m. The News said he was found by another student in the school. The victim was transported to a local hospital, where he later died.&&&1
Sea Shepherd Seeks Criminal Charges Against Japanese Whaling Ship&&&The sea shepherd group are the ones that should be prosecuted.

They get away with it. There are legal ways to protest and then theirs the way this fanatical green backed terrorist group acts! terrorism: "The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons." terrorist : "One that engages in acts or an act of terrorism."

A funny thing happened on Yoani Sanchez's way to the U.S.&&&KUDOS!!! I would imagine that just a couple of weeks ago, the panorama looked a lot different for former Castro intelligence officer turned American academic Arturo Lopez-Levy and his pro-Castro regime group, CAFE (Cuban Americans for Engagement). With Yoani Sanchez coming to the United States, they were sure her views on the U.S. embargo of Cuba would certainly rile up the Cuban exile community, exposing them as intransigent and intolerant buffoons, as Lopez-Levy regularly characterizes them. But a funny thing happened on Yoani Sanchez's way to the U.S. It turns out that in spite of Yoani's views on the embargo, she has been embraced by leaders of the Cuban American community for her staunch opposition to the repressive dictatorship of the Castro regime. It turns out that instead of focusing on the few differences of opinion, the exile community and Yoani are focusing on the important issues they have in common, such as freeing the nation of Cuba from the yoke of tyranny. And the most interesting thing of all, it turns out that CAFE, the group who has always claimed to be the "tolerant" Cuban Americans, are the ones who have zero tolerance for anyone who does not march lockstep with their agenda. After seeing their grand plan to discredit and demonize the historic Cuban exile community crumble right before their eyes, Arturo Lopez-Levy's group CAFE went into panic mode and showed their true colors. Instead of embracing differences in opinion, CAFE decided to launch a vicious attack against Yoani, simply because she does not subscribe to their specific agenda of demonizing the historic Cuban exile community.

We Need the Voting Rights Act&&&The Voting Rights Act (VRA) must be upheld by the supreme court: Discrimination is alive today unfortunately; Liberty and justice for all is openly sabotaged and the Supreme Court is inviting trouble of great magnitudnal proportions if it dares to fail its ultimate mandate: to uphold everyone's constitutional rights. We not only need to keep the protections in the current Voting Rights Act (VRA), it should be expanded. The numerous despicable attempts to restrict voting made during the last election cycle are proof of that. Anyone who truly believes the VRA is obsolete needs to recognize, given last year's voter suppression efforts, the Jim Crowe era is biding its time, lurking in the shadows waiting for an opportunity to rear its head once again. If properly educated and aroused to stand up against Supreme Court activism from the bench the entire nation will speak against it because the Voting Rights Act (VRA) is not about political parties; the Voting Rights Act (VRA) is about individual rights protection. Bank on it! it is time to review; the Supreme Court's Justice Scalia's attack on VRA as " racial entitlements" will not stand the test of time. If the Supreme Court does not uphold the Voting Rights ACT it is no longer acting as an unbiased institution and that, its Justices, can be challenged in public. Supreme Court Justices, get up and do your job or we will make it happen! Count on it! Now Even if you are dumb enough to believe that all is OK with the world and there are no reasons to have the voting rights act on the books. Then why are the the parties at opposite end's on this ? Why are the Republicans in America trying to keep people from the poles ? Well I will tell you what I think. I think there may be a dozen or two, man and women (Billionaires) in America that have the means to buy the power it wants to call all shots in this Country. The only way they can obtain this right now is get the people they want in office. To buy them so to say. But they know they can be stopped at the voting polls as proven in the 2012 election. They know the more that get out and vote there chances are reduced substantially. Commentator George Will knows this and should be ashamed of his views on VRA. He says VRA is 47 years old. Is that old ? I don't think so. Look at the constitution, at that II Amendment a lot older right. SS, Medicare, still very new in the big picture. But look at who wants to change them. Not working men and women, no the big bosses. They do not like to match payments that is what this is all about. They did not like it back in the 1930s and they do not like it now. So Americans do not be fooled by the right wing opposition and all of you older people that now have this little benefit fight like h--- to keep it just as it is. It just might be all there is between eating and striving !! The argument is that VRA is discriminatory against Southern states to require them but not other states to seek pre-clearance for voting laws; I actually agree. The Voting Rights Act should require *all* states to seek pre-clearance. After what we've seen the GOP try to pass in states all across the nation prior to the last 2012 election, I see no reason this safeguard against voter suppression should be limited to just Southern states as suggested by VRA of 1965 but now should be expanded to apply to ALL 50 states. It is urgent that whoever can go to the Supreme Court and organize peaceful, non-violent civil disobedience protests in front of the Supreme Court ASAP to do so right away!&&&4

Hussein Obama wants to muslimize Libya like he did Egypt. He sent in his 'rebels', which in reality are his homeboy muslim homeboy terrorists, to help overthrow Gadhafi. Gadhafi needs to unleash some of his secreted firepower on this bully. The U.S. has no business over there. Hussein Obama has a personal stake in the matter, for it is a stepping stone to attack ISRAEL. We all know that Hussein hates Jews with a deep-rooted passion, as do most liberal/socialist politicians. This would put a (pimp's) feather in his cap with the Muslim Brotherhood.&&&69

Shouldn't we, as Taxpayers expect our highly paid lawmen to be in reasonable physical condition? Is it really asking too much? A favorite way for a fat lawman to leave his job is to go out on a medical leave. A permenant medical leave. The cause of the leave? Heart problems as a result of stress of the job. Fat and out of shape lawmen have been known to go out on a permanent job related injury; claiming a weak heart due to stress. The fact that the are obese, can barely drag their lard a$$es out of their chairs, and they frequently spend the day with jelly filling and sugar on their faces doesn't seem to enter into the equation. This man is a disappointment. Not only as a lawman, but even as a human being. Put the donuts down and get yourself in shape man!&&&1

Obama set to plunge into roiling Mideast waters&&&The Trojan Horse of the Infiltration of Communism (Judaism) Into America !!! Strictly speaking it is INCORRECT to call an Ancient Israelite a 'Jew' or to call a contemporary Jew an israelite or a Hebrew." (1980 Jewish Almanac, p. 3). "Edom is in Modern Jewry" ~ The Jewish Encyclopedia 1905 edition "JEWS BEGAN TO CALL THEMSELVES HEBREWS AND ISRAELITES IN 1860".~ Encyclopedia Judaica 1971 Vol 10:23 (They were Edomites/Kenites before that, hmmm, how did they change their Cain DNA/genes in the 19th century???)!!!!! "Judaism is Communism, this symbol of chaos and of the spirit of destruction, is above all an Anti-Christian and Anti-Social Conception. This present destructive tendency is clearly advantageous for only one national and religious entity: Judaism" - Weltkampf, July 1924, p. 21; "The Secret Powers Behind Revolution", by Vicomte Leon De Poncins, p. 140 "Judaism is a license to lie, cheat, steal, rob, exploit, prostitute, enslave, destroy, torture, murder� as long as the victim is not Jewish (but White). It�s a mental disease somewhere in between bipolar disorder and psychopathy. It�s the membership in a terrorist, satanic cult." -Andrew Winkler, Editor/Publisher, ZioPedia So just pray that you never become "Judaized" because....."To Judaize" is defined as "To be conformed to the manner of the Jews" !!! "Pharisiasm became Talmudism, Talmudism became Medieval Rabbinism and Medieval Rabbinism became Modern Rabbinism and (Modern Rabbinism became Judaism). But throughout these changes in name...the spirit of the ancient Pharisees survives, unaltered...From Palestine to Babylon (to America)= Judaism" !!! "The Jewish serpent will show its hydra�s heads everywhere, blocking the way to a relaxation of international tensions. We Jews will not allow peace in the world, however hard statesmen and peace advocates try to bring it about.�� London Jewish Chronicle, March 3, 1939 "The Communists (Jews) are against religion (Christianity), and they seek to destroy religion; yet, when we look deeper into the nature of Communism, we see that it is essentially nothing else than a religion (Judaism)." (A Program for the Jews and Humanity, Rabbi Harry Waton, p. 138). "Judaism and Communism are one and the same." ~ HILARY COTTER, author of Cardinal Minszenty, The Truth About His Real "Crime," page 6 "Communism is Judaism.

Otto Weininger, a Jew, Sex & Character, pp 311 ! �Zionism is Judaism, and Judaism is unthinkable without Zionism.�(Harper�s Encyclopedia of United States History, Vol. X,�Zionists�). �Some call it Marxism [Communism], I call it Judaism.�� Rabbi S. Wise, The American Bulletin, May 5, 1935.(Judaism is nothing but disguised, camouflaged Communism, therefore, Zionism is nothing but disguised, camouflaged Communism)!!! "First of all, we have to understand what communism is.....real communism, the Soviet communism, is basically a mask for Bolshevism, which is a mask for Judaism.~ Bobby Fischer, a Jew, press Conference, September 1 1992 "The Talmud is to this day the circulating heart's blood of the Jewish Religion (Judaism). Whatever laws, customs or ceremonies we observe - whether we are orthodox, conservative, reform or merely spasmodic sentamentalists, we follow the Talmud. It is our Common Law."

San Diego Committee Supports Immigration Reform&&&"The resolution from City Council Republicans supports "a reasonable and practical plan that allows unauthorized immigrants currently residing in the United States to earn legal status and is contingent upon successfully securing the nation's borders." It's not reform they want, it's amnesty with no enforcement. How does that solve illegal aliens from coming here? The 1986 amnesty: "For the first six months after the amnesty there was a modest fall in illegal immigration, but within 12 months illegal immigration was breaking all previous records, rising to 800,000 per year. Friends and relatives of the newly legalized immigrants began to pour into the United States. They were followed by more illegal job seekers who saw continued opportunities for more amnesties. In fact, the 1986 amnesty resulted in six more amnesties from 1994 to 2000, awarding legal status to another 3.0 million illegal immigrants. By 1997, the number of illegal immigrants in the country was already back up to the 5.0 million in the U.S. before the 1986 amnesty. Amnesty has proved to be a slippery slope. Amnesties beget more amnesties and more illegal immigrants. Can you imagine the consequences of amnesty for the 11 million or more illegals now in the United States?"&&&1
Iraq War's 10th Anniversary: The Invasion&&&Iraq/Military-Industrial Complex/The Ruling Class Eisenhower warns us of the military industrial complex ======= What I Knew Before the Invasion November 20, 2005 By Senator Bob Graham I, too, presumed the president was being truthful -- until a series of events undercut that confidence. In February 2002, after a briefing on the status of the war in Afghanistan, the commanding officer, Gen. Tommy Franks, told me the war was being compromised as specialized personnel and equipment were being shifted from Afghanistan to prepare for the war in Iraq -- a war more than a year away. Even at this early date, the White House was signaling that the threat posed by Saddam Hussein was of such urgency that it had priority over the crushing of al Qaeda. In the early fall of 2002, a joint House-Senate intelligence inquiry committee, which I co-chaired, was in the final stages of its investigation of what happened before Sept. 11. As the unclassified final report of the inquiry documented, several failures of intelligence contributed to the tragedy. But as of October 2002, 13 months later, the administration was resisting initiating any substantial action to understand, much less fix, those problems. At a meeting of the Senate intelligence committee on Sept. 5, 2002, CIA Director George Tenet was asked what the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) provided as the rationale for a preemptive war in Iraq. An NIE is the product of the entire intelligence community, and its most comprehensive assessment. I was stunned when Tenet said that no NIE had been requested by the White House and none had been prepared. Invoking our rarely used senatorial authority, I directed the completion of an NIE.&&&57

Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over ignorance.

Anybody got any good jokes that are fairly clean?&&&A man escapes from a prison where he�s been locked up for 15 years He breaks into a house and inside, he finds a young couple in bed. He ties him to a chair. While tying the wife to the bed, the convict gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he�s in there, the husband whispers over to his wife, �Listen, this guy is an escaped convict. Look at his clothes! He�s probably spent a lot of time in jail and hasn�t seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don�t resist, don�t complain. Do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is obviously very dangerous. If he gets angry, he�ll kill us both. Be strong, honey.I love you!� She responds:�He wasn�t kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me that he�s gay, thinks you�re cute, and asked if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you, too.�&&&1

As I was watching WFTV last night and this morning, they made sure to repeat the same clips over and over again. Showing 2 student interviews. This was a perfect example of manipulation. The first interview they keep airing is this little girly man. Now, his sexual orientation means nothing, but, let's call a spade a spade here. He was more feminine they many females. In the interview on UCF campus he keeps saying over and over about how scared he is and how everything is so scary. Be a man. There are situations you as a individual cannot control. Stand up to the face of it and be a man. Not some little sniveling bitch. The second interview was even more disturbing. This guy is standing in front of UCF arena saying how scary it is and that they need more security. And even says, "I know it violates our rights, but, they need to do something. I would be willing to give up our rights for more safety."&&&8

I think it's a REFLECTION of the SYSTEMS that profit from the misery and grief, every system peer-reviewed by the PhDs that designed it, implement it, oversee it, evaluate it, market it and sell it, just like religions, just a different form of 'tyranny,' and more and more just can't stand it, the powerlessness, killing others and/or themselves as some twisted 'statement.'

They begin sensing that something is amiss, and start looking for answers. Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening. Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over ignorance. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Senate group considers change in family visas as part of immigration deal&&&(CBS) It was 5 a.m. and CBS News national correspondent Byron Pitts is with a woman who is nine months pregnant. She's rushed to a south Texas hospital to undergo a C-section - a $4,700 medical procedure that won't cost her a dime. She qualifies for emergency Medicaid. She gave birth to a healthy, 8 1/2 pound baby boy - born in America. His Mexican mother gave him an American name: Eliot. Eliot is one of an estimated 300,000 children of illegal immigrants born in the United States every year, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. They're given instant citizenship because they are born on U.S. soil, which makes it easier for their parents to become U.S. citizens. That's because those babies can eventually sponsor their parents - when they turn 21 years old. As for Eliot's mother, no longer as fearful of deportation, she told CBS News her name, Fabiola, and her story. "So your son is an American citizen. What does that mean to you?" Pitts asked. "I am very glad that he was born. That's why I came here - so my children, my husband and I could have a better life," she said through a translator. Back in December, when she was six months pregnant, Fabiola, her husband and their two daughters - ages 4 and 11 - crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico into the U.S.&&&12
Portman to GOP: Don't talk to your kids&&&Wow! That's free SNL material from the Family Values party. No doubt the silence will come back to bite them. Sunday, March 17, 2013 Portman to GOP: Don't talk to your kids borowitz-rob-portman-580.jpg By Andy Borowitz WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)�The decision of Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) to support same-sex marriage after learning that his son was gay has inspired hundreds of other Republican lawmakers to stop speaking to their children immediately, G.O.P. leaders confirmed today. �I have gathered my caucus and told them, if your kids are going to tell you something that�s going to cost you the next election, it�s better to nip that situation in the bud,� said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).�Just stop talking to them altogether, for heaven�s sakes.� Speaker Boehner said he was advising his fellow Republicans who were �hell bent on speaking to their children� to keep things superficial:�You can talk about sports. You can talk about the weather. But anything beyond that, your policy should be,�Don�t ask, don�t tell.�� But even as Mr. Boehner laid down the new guidelines for not speaking to one�s children, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) said that the policy �doesn�t go far enough.� �What if you�re having a conversation with your kids and it turns out they�re in favor of raising the capital-gains tax or banning assault rifles?� he said.�Do what I do�block their calls.� Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) agreed with his fellow G.O.P. leaders� words of caution, adding,�Fortunately, none of my children want to talk to me.�&&&8

Give illegal immigrants a shot at community college&&&"This is the contradiction of House Bill 218, sponsored by Reps. George Cleveland, R-Onslow, and Chris Whitmire, R-Transylvania, and three others. If the bill were to become law, young North Carolinians who do not have legal immigration status would be barred from attending the state�s community colleges. It would also affect students here under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals imitative, or DACA, implemented by President Obama." What Obama has done is against federal law. I'am a democrat and i back barring these illegal aliens. First things first. First you get a visa to come here and after approval then you can talk about going to school or working or anything else. You don't break into a country first and demand any thing.&&&9

You should pray too. Pray that you never have to feel the pain and loss that you have caused to Sheila. That puppy was like a child to her. Did it make you feel so brave running over a 14 lb dog with your 2000+ vehicle? If I find out who you are, I will press charges for felony animal abuse and see you sent to the state penitentiary. I'm sure that the animal lovers there will be as gentle with you as you were with little Brutus. I won't threaten to harm you, you aren't worth my going to jail for. I will offer a reward for information leading to your arrest and conviction though.&&&1

Deadly delay on Syria&&&The new failed Foreign policy of Kerry represents the used to be American superpower is: "Do what you want about Syria arming and I will do nothing to stop you" which is surprisingly similar to the foreign policy of Luxemburg and Monaco. Under the incompetent Obama, US lost its influence and allies in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe and the rest of the world as America is seen as broke and bankrupted country ruled by out of control drunk sailor who takes money from half the hard working conservative American people and giving it to the liberal parasitic Blacks, Hispanics and Middle Eastern that refuse to work and to pay taxes. Obama cannot buy the trust of former US allies because Obama cannot be trusted to make any promises about financing or arming other countries that make any sense. So please do what you want about the civil war in Syria and please do not bother asking Obama who is busy playing golf.&&&5

Sooo mommie and daddy think it time for their "rights", their turn! THE ONLY WAY I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD RENDER CITIZENSHIP ON THESE PEOPLE WHO CAUSED IT ALL IS TO USE THEM FOR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS... I really don't think that the kids should get a free pass either!!! What makes them more special than America's foster kids, who don't get tuition breaks and are dumped with nothing at 18? What about America's children from single parent poverty families? After all, they fall under the category of, "...through no fault of their own." What makes illegal alien kids so special?

Stepping up the fight against gun violence&&&I agree with the letter about gun violence. It has gotten out of hand. Guns should be nearly as easy to get as a driver's license. It should be required that gun purchasers show proof that one has: 1)completed a safety course, including hands on training 2)meet certain eligibility requirements such as not being on a list of felons, stalkers, and mentally ill, 3)have proof of liability insurance. All of these things and more are done routinely by people wishing to drive in our state, it shouldn't be a burdon for gun purchasers to be nearly as responsible. I like the objectives of the Concerned Citizens Against Gun Violence and will email them. Thanks for pointing to a local group working for reasonable gun reform.&&&5

Bill O Reilly Brave Enough To Stand Up&&&He did not, but if Bill O' Reilly Had identified Gays with pedophiles/ pederast he would have been right on the money! > Homosexuals make up less than 2% of the population . "The rate of homosexual versus heterosexual child sexual abuse is staggering,"Homosexuals make up less than 2% of the population . "Abel�s data of 150.2 boys abused per male homosexual offender finds no equal (yet) in heterosexual violations of 19.8 girls." Authorities say evidence examined disproves the assertion that child molestation is more prevalent among heterosexuals. > Gay Activists assert that heterosexuals molest more children then Gays, that is only because Gays make up less than 2% of the population, yet they are responsible for over 33% of the child molestations. If there were as many Gays as there are NORMAL PEOPLE/ heterosexuals the Gay Child Molestation rate would be 20 times heterosexuals. Bill was right to go after Ferrantino and The State of Colarado.&&&1

They begin sensing that something is amiss, and start looking for answers. Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening. Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over ignorance. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Sabah terrorist attack, disputes & effective control&&&The Philippines govt and many Pinoys love to cite the rule of effective control in territorial conflicts. For instance, they say regardless what history and treaties say about some of the Spratly Islands, now some of them are under Filipino control. So invasion and illegitimate occupation will one day become legitimate. They are saying the law is not important. See who have bigger fists.(Pinoys are weak in military power but they believe that the big brother is behind them. So they are bellicose and eager to challenge other countries. Would Uncle Sam want their young people die for Filipino territorial ambition???) Hey, is Sabad under the effective control of Great Britain and Malaysia for a long time. The federation of Malaysia has exerted effective control and administration of the piece of territory since 1962.

Missouri Sex Offender Laws: Need to be changed?&&&The ignorance continues. Where is the connection between ALL sex offenders and any danger to children? The real danger is in the labeling all sex offenders as potential child molesters. This label keeps men and women convicted of any sex related crime from rebuilding their lives with their families and leaves thousands of children from having 2 parent families. Restrictions put on these offenders restrict where they live and participation in their childrens lives. The research is out there and there is NO correlation between those that offend against adults and those that offend against children. Maybe if the restrictions limiting interaction with children were directed at those with prior convictions involving CHILDREN, law inforcment would be able to better protect our children!! As I previously stated there are many studies out there and the only sex offenders that pose any possible danger to children where previously convicted of crimes involving children. Once again this is a case of the government passing laws without researching the problem and therefore causing undue hardship on thousands of adults and children.&&&109

Most Idaho dairy workers are not here legally&&&If there are so many dairy companies violating the law why is nothing being done? Is it because politicians like Rep. Raul Labrador and other officials are receiving pay offs or political favors to look the other way while criminal enterprises are operating openly? There should be a federal investigation of the dairy operations, the industry groups, lobbyists, politicians and law enforcement officials to find out why such corruption exists in the industry. Obviously the government knows about this criminal activity, including tax fraud, identity theft, identity fraud, immigration fraud and violations of labor laws.In addition to federal and state subsidies dairy prices are held, by regulation, at inflated prices to guarantee that the dairy companies make a profit yet the dairy companies still openly and with the support of politicians violate the law in order to increase profits. Americans are over paying for dairy products and being put out of work so that a handful of people can make even more money. This is an organised criminal enterprise and RICCO laws need to be applied here.&&&17
Armenian Genocide lie collapted&&&Two New Theories about Armenian Genocide... Did they kill 1.500.000 armenians and carried them to Syria by train wagons or trucks when 1.000.000 Turkish soldiers were struggling in Canakkale with allies 1.500.000 Deads = 9000 Train Wagons one wagon=20 metres 9000 wagons=180.000 Metres 1000metres=1 Km. 180.000 metres= 180 kms. Istanbul-Yalova =176 kms Berlin-leipzig =178 kms Istanbul-Edirne= 180 kms Roma -Napoli = 188 kms hahahaahahahaah Hahahaahahahaah hahahahahaahaha hahaahahahahaah In Turkish we say""It is a lie with a long tail"" This one is lie with a long Train :))) hahahahaahahah Hahahaahahahaah hahahaahahahaha hahahahaahahaha If turks could kill %50 more armenians, Wagons may fit this distance too:))) Turks were poor in WW 1 they could not kill them all with gas and burn them in specially designed owens with coal. They killed them with rifles and pistols. Every single victim has been shot with 3 bullets for the certain result. That means 4.5 millions of bullets. One bullet is 20grams that makes 90.000.000 grams 90.000 kilos 90 tons It took 5 minutes to kill a victim and at least 15 minutes more to carry to the wagons That makes 20 minutes. 1.500.000 victims X 20 minutes 30.000.000.000 minutes 500.000 hours At least 2 soldiers must be there to carry. that means 3 millions soldiers. that makes another transportation problem All Ottoman empire was 10 millions in the ww 1 and they were fighting in 12 fronts in the same time. Only in Dardanelles 250 000 soldiers have been killed in 1915 . If The Turks worked 12 hours a day 500.000 hours made 41.666 days. It means 114 years. 1915+114 years This means the Genocide is still going on... HAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHA HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH AHAH HAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH AHAAHAHAHA Another Thesis;This one is funnier than the others.... Prof Dr Mumtaz expains genocide story in engineering approach. This is my Phd thesis in Harvard University.Civil engineering department. : Subject:Optimum excavation calculation for 7500 massgraves,for 1.5 million Armenian. : Standart grave sizes:0.8m width,2m lenght,1.2 hight Volume:0.8 x 2 x 1.2 = 1.92m3 : Turks are barbarian and genocider people so i accepted that they put 3 armenian in that volume. : So 1.92 / 3=0.64m3 So for 1.5 million Armenian it needs 1.500,000x0.64=960000 m3 earth work for excavation. if we add ''refill'', it is 960000 x 2 = 1920 000 m3 earth work (excavation plus refill) : nearly 2 million meter cube. : Necessary equipments and machines for that earth work: 10 excavator 4 Grader 2 Dozer 10 Loder 2 Scraper 10 Tractor 2 Water truck 2 Fuel truck 50 Lorry (Daper) Staff: 1 Project manager 10 Civil engineer 2 Geological engineer 2 Mechanical engineer 10 Surveyor 20 Formen 30 Technition 100 Driver 2500 Worker : Duration of the project:2 Years.(1915+2=1917) : I like Armenian genocide story. According to USA documents of 1922 There were 3.300.000armenians are in Turkey and the territory. Lets make a calculation There were 2.200.000 Armenians in Turkey in 1914 Turks murdered (hahahaha)1.500.000 until 1918 but Armenians worked very hard and rise their population to 3.300.000like rats and rabbits. hahahahaha hahahaahahahaha hahahaahahahahaahahaha&&&1

A man who has a hidden agenda for the U.S. and funds the fully operational Fema concentration camps that are fully operational and in his Obama Care Bill provides the way of RFID chipping of people like cattle.

Support for Gay Marriage Crosses Party Lines&&&It really doesn't matter gay marriage will be dealt a significant blow when the Supreme Court rules against it. Can't happen you say?

The Army and PTSD: Keeping Soldiers' Best Interests At Heart, Unless...&&&The military probably has the PTSD from listening to the Mental Health Industry bullshitting about the PTSD Inside the Battle to Define Mental Illness Every so often Al Frances says something that seems to surprise even him. Just now, for instance, in the predawn darkness of his comfortable, rambling home in Carmel, California, he has broken off his exercise routine to declare that �there is no definition of a mental disorder. It�s bullshit. I mean, you just can�t define it.� Then an odd, reflective look crosses his face, as if he�s taking in the strangeness of this scene: Allen Frances, lead editor of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association�s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (universally known as the DSM-IV), the guy who wrote the book on mental illness, confessing that �these concepts are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the boundaries.� For the first time in two days, the conversation comes to an awkward halt.

How typical. What BS. "Activists" should note his change and focus immediately on what needs to be done and who the people are who worked so hard to get us this far instead of paying Portman any mind. Besides, no indication that Portman has changed or even apologized for all the other anti glbt positions besides marriage which he has furthered throughout his miserable, anti rational, evilgelical political career.&&&1

in his Fifth Term, Big Bill as Entrenched as he Ever Was&&&This UT "news" article would be better described as an "attack piece" but it may be that Bill Horn has earned the criticism by his failure to bring home the best bacon of all; plentiful cheap clean water for his constituents. Twenty years of tolerating the absurdly inappropriate planning/design of County flood control managers is proof positive that the Board of Supervisors is collectively deficient in common sense or personal integrity. Piling bond debt upon the public to build stormwater infrastructure for land developers whose windfall profits exceed that bond is obviously a criminal offense. If Bill has not spoken out strongly against County policies that defy State water law then he deserves to be replaced. He should have recognized that the Public Works chiefs were grossly misinforming their bosses. Competent news reporters not constrained by job security fears would have exposed this game long ago so that voters had a clear view of how well their politicians were managing their land-water-energy. But capable reporters understand that editors also have bosses who will replace them if the cosy relationship between politicians and speculators posing as "land developers" is investigated too closely. And reporters are just as good as politicians at convincing themselves it is best to avoid being fired by not digging too deeply into the can of worms that is County Government. Why has Bill Horn been singled out for ridicule? Could it be that he does not listen well to land developers? Or does he listen too closely to professional liars serving the 'wrong' land developers, those who focus on North County? Whichever; His failure to push County Flood Control into doing the job assigned by the 1945 Legislature (the last one to be dominated by capable and honest politicians) has discredited him with constituents who now recognize the game; - Forcing the public to pay extortion prices for land-water-energy by dumping their precious rainwater to the ocean at much greater expense than storing it for their use.&&&1

Abe questioned validity of Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal verdict&&&More denial from Japan: Tokyo Trials war crimes convictions were victors' justice: PM Abe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe listens to a question during a lower house Budget Committee meeting on March 12.(Mainichi) &#25313;&#22823;&# 20889;&#30495; The Tokyo war crimes trials following World War II were no more than exercises in victors' justice, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told legislators on March 12. "The view of that great war was not formed by the Japanese themselves, but rather by the victorious Allies, and it is by their judgment only that (Japanese) have been condemned," Abe said during a House of Representatives Budget Committee session. During his first stint as prime minister in 2006-2007, Abe stated that the verdicts of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, known more commonly as the Tokyo Trials, "have been accepted by Japan, and so we are in no position to object now." Abe's March 12 comments can be seen as consistent with his previous statements on the Tokyo Trials, but the prime minister has nevertheless risked harsh criticism from former colony South Korea as well as the Allied nations, including China and the United States. Also according to Abe, a consultative body under the Allied General Headquarters (GHQ) "moved to shut down" the very short-lived post-war committee established by the Cabinet of former Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara to investigate the reasons for Japan's defeat. "I think (GHQ) suppressed the committee over worries it would discuss views of the war that were inconvenient to the Allies," Abe said. Abe also said, however, that "evaluations of history are best left to the experts. If the government began research into historical issues and presenting opinions, it could create diplomatic problems." Before the December lower house election last year, Abe stated that he may review the so-called "Kono Statement" on Korean comfort women -- women forced into sexual slavery to the former Imperial Japanese Army. Since taking office, Abe has indicated he would not get involved in any review of the statement out of consideration for Japan's international relations, but his latest comments could cause concerns in the U.S. During his first administration, Abe said that Class A war criminals "are not war criminals under the laws of Japan," and taken with his March 12 comments, his views could very well cast a shadow on Japan-U.S. relations. .

Japan PM (Abe) dismisses war crimes verdict as victor's justice !&&&The Telegraph, United Kingdom, March 14, 2013 Report title: Japan PM dismisses WWII war crimes trials as 'victors' justice' Japan's nationalist prime minister has dismissed the Tokyo war crimes trials in the aftermath of World War II as nothing more than victors' justice. Previously, Mr Abe had said that the 28 Japanese military and political leaders charged with Class-A war crimes are 'not war criminals under the laws of Japan' Photo: AFP ---------- By Julian Ryall, Tokyo 2:24PM GMT 14 Mar 2013 Shinzo Abe, who was elected in a landslide general election victory in December, expressed beliefs that are likely to trigger anger in nations that were occupied by the forces of imperial Japan in the early decades of the last century and raise eyebrows in allied nations, primarily the United States. "The view of that great war was not formed by the Japanese themselves, but rather by the victorious Allies, and it is by their judgement only that [Japanese] were condemned," Mr Abe told a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on Tuesday. In his previous short-lived spell as prime minister, for 12 months from September 2006, Mr Abe said that the 28 Japanese military and political leaders charged with Class-A war crimes are "not war criminals under the laws of Japan." More than 5,700 Japanese were charged with Class B and C war crimes before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, which was convened on April 29, 1946. Initially, 984 individuals were sentenced to death and 475 received life sentences. After the prolonged legal discussions, seven were executed in December 1948, including General Hideki Tojo, the commander of the Kwantung Army and later the prime minister, while the majority of the others sentenced to hang or life prison terms were paroled by the mid-1950s. Note: Unlike Germany, Japan never admits its heinous war crimes.&&&1

If I lived in North Dakota, I would go out right now and purposely get knocked up just so I could HAVE an abortion before this twisted ban takes effect, take pictures of it, and then post it all over every single publication, news outlet, and political site in the state. Just one more red state that needs to be annexed from the REAL United States along with Texas and the rest of the backwards south. I had NO IDEA that the midwest was becoming the new backwards, inbred, sister-effing south. You idiots just took a giant step backwards into the dark ages. ROT, North Dakota. I hope ALL of your doctors leave the state. ZYGOTES ARE NOT FRIGGIN' PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!! All conservative politicians need to be taken out and sent into outerspace without a spacesuit.&&&3
As one illegal-immigrant brother wins reprieve, another awaits decision&&&For some reason illegl aliens believe that if they have been here for longer than a year, they have a right to be here. The only reason we have problems with illegal immigration is because we do not uniformly enforce our laws! The exceptions we make cause problems. Now, what are the DACA going to do when their 2 years are up and the obam is a lame duck? Oh well, all he needed was to get reelected. I bet the illegal aliens didn't see that one coming...569&&&13

'Catastrophic' cyberattack could hit utilities like PG&E&&&"Hoping to minimize that possibility, the California Public Utilities Commission is considering rules to bolster cybersecurity protections. The agency, which held the forum Sample attended, warned in a recent report that utilities are becoming increasingly vulnerable as their networks add smart meters and other computerized gear." Port probe programs like Nmap can get through firewalls in order to "pobe" a system for "vulnerlabilities". It has an actual legitimate purpose, but can also be used to compromise a computer system. Part of the problem is Management wanting to get their system on the internet, perhaps some random server somewhere in the "cloud". Then they, the company doesn't have to take responsibility for their SCADA system operation and maintenance. A great number of these Managers believe going to windows based systems and the "latest greatest" servers and protocol will keep them safe. From the hackers point of view, it is much more effective to concentrate on windows based operating systems and internet protocols rather than try to hack some old or obscure operating system. Hackers can use probing programs to gain entry into a windows based system, then can use other programs to circumvent software protections and gain an ever increasing cache of information about a particular system. Peeling back layer after layer of security until they own the system.&&&1

UN says US drones violate Pakistan's sovereignty&&&UN report portray Obama as the �invisible ruthless killer from the skies� of Pakistan who was behind killing of more than 200 innocent civilians in 25 drone attacks that we not approved by Pakistan. Obama did not want to use our superior US troops and US jets and artillery to fight the Taliban terrorists that he sympathize with according to Karzai. The drone attacks on people in Pakistan with no intelligence on the ground are another reckless Obama tactics that aimed to create illusion of fighting the Taliban which is not the reality on the ground. When US will leave soon Afghanistan, the Taliban Mozlem brother terrorists will take over Afghanistan and remove Karzai from power which means Afghanistan becoming enemy of America under Obama regime. It is time to tell the truth about the Taliban victory and US defeat in Afghanistan under the failed Obama command which gave advantage to the Taliban terrorists over US troops in rules of engagement. It is time for Obama to stop killing innocent people while telling the American people lies and deceit about his fake �success� war against the Taliban terrorists which he negotiate with about restoring their rule of the Shariya laws in Afghanistan.&&&8
THE GREAT SPELL CASTER SAVED MY LIFE&&&I'd like to share with you a very weird thing that happened to me last week. For those who reside in Johannesburg South Africa, you probably know of Gandhi Square in the CBD area. Well my experience happened around there last week Wednesday when my boyfriend and I went to go help a friend of his whose tire Burst and didn't have a spare. Luckily for him we were in the vicinity so we Quickly drove to where he was. My boyfriend got out and helped his friend change his Tire and while they were Doing that I got out of the car and wandered off because it was a beautiful Sunny afternoon and I tend to get motion sickness a lot so I can't stand Sitting in a car for too long. I stood outside a McDonald's and this old beggar approached me and asked me for money but unfortunately I wasn't carrying any cash on me and I told him this which he seemed to understand. Now this man was Probably in his forties if I were to guess, but because he was a beggar and Therefore dirty I can't be too sure. He then just stood there staring at me which kind of made me feel uncomfortable And as I was moving away from him back towards our car he said I must wait. Don't know why but for some reason I stopped and complied. He then proceeded to Tell me that I looked very unhappy and that there was a shadow next to me. At First I thought he was nuts but what he said next freaked me out, he said, It's Not the house that is cold, but this shadow that is always next to me. He told Me someone doesn't like me and has sent this thing to drain me (not sure I Understand what he meant). A few feet away my boyfriend and his friend were done and he called out my name For us to get going. I must've turned away for a few seconds but when I turned Around again the beggar was gone. I assumed he must have walked away so I Walked back to my boyfriend and his friend to tell them what had just happened To me, but when I got to them before I could even tell them my boyfriend's Friend laughed and asked me why I was talking to myself. He's one of my Boyfriend�s not-so-mature friends so I just assumed he was being rude towards The beggar and told him that wasn't cool and that they are people too. My Boyfriend and he exchanged looks and my boyfriend said there was no one next To me and that I was standing alone all this time. I looked for help the next day and meet MOHAMMED ABDULLAH FARYE`S how charged me R100 only And he accurately told me what had happened last night, he even showed me The beggar and the person how was after me in the mirror with my own eyes. he prayed for me and I managed to get protection from the evil shadow that followed me the person how sent it to me.i used not to be live in witchcraft but i think things do exist and for all those nights when I used to get terrible wet dreams having sex with the ghost. Every since I meet MOHAMMED ABDULLAH FARYE`S, i have not encountered this situation again. Have recommended my entire friend to find this man for help. I will not give his number to anyone how wishes to be assisted.+27738308645 THANK YOU MOHAMMED email at abdullahfaryes@gmail.com&&&1

VIDEO: Three Years Since The Stimulus, A Look At Its Success | ThinkProgress __._,_.___ We've achieved an historic victory for America with President Obama and Vice President Biden. Let's see to it that we keep this going for years to come. Stay with us, the work to take America back from the cons has just begun. VIDEO: Three Years Since The Stimulus, A Look At Its Success By Travis Waldron on Feb 15, 2012 at 10:35 am The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus, became law three years ago this week, signed by President Obama less than a month into his presidency. At the time, financial and housing crises had plunged the American economy into a deep recession � in January 2009, the economy lost more than 800,000jobs, more than in any single month in 60 years. With its investments into infrastructure projects, tax cuts, and aid to states, the stimulus was designed to curb the effects of the recession and turn the economy back around. Though Republicans have criticized the effort and subsequent attempts to stimulate the economy as �failed policies,� early analysis has shown that the stimulus saved and created millions of jobs and pulled the American economy away from the precipice of collapse. In a new analysis, Center for American Progress Director for Tax and Budget Policy Michael Linden examined the American economy in three parts � before the recession, during the recession, and after the stimulus passed � to find out if the stimulus did, indeed, work. As the video below shows, there is no doubt that the stimulus turned the economy around and put it on the path to recovery: Tags: American Recovery and Reinvestment ActStimulus&&&40

We need the party of The Americans that stand for LIBERTY and FREEDOM and prosperity. We need to take over local media stations and local print media and tell the truth.

NEW YORK LAWMAKERS OVERLOOK THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OF JUDGE DRAGER&&&HUNDREDS ARE DEMANDING THE REMOVAL OF JUDGE LAURA DRAGER, CEO OF NEW YORK'S DIVORCE COMPANY. SHE HAS UNLAWFULLY SEIZED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY FROM INNOCENT WOMEN It is a right of passage, when Judge Drager is your Judge at your Divorce. You must put up your "real estate" as a sacrifice to the Drager god. Judge Drager has to pay her bills! Paying off lawyers, public relations experts to submerge negative text is an expensive proposition. This corrupt Judge has quite a network in place to steal a woman's assets. The process is as follows: 1. The Drager "Crackpot" Syndrome: Judge Drager throws negative stories in the press about an accomplished woman to destroy her credibility. 2. She Allows the "Money" Spouse to break the law and not pay child support for years, to strangle the woman to death financially 3. Ladies Beware of the Drager "Fake Jail Maneuver"! If Judge Drager throws your husband in jail overnight, at the very beginning of the litigation for failing to pay several months of support..hold on to your hat because you are in for a bumpy ride. Because after this one legal gesture, she will not enforce a single Court Order for the next four or five years which will cost you millions of dollars. This clever "fake jail maneuver just covers her behind" that she enforced the law once, which gives her license to take everything. That's a clever touch and your husband must be a really big fish for her to go to the trouble. You must own a part of his company that she is going to steel out from under you! 4. Judge Drager "influences" your attorney to work against you, and then when you have a problem with it she throws more negative information into the Press to show that you are difficult to deal with, the attorney then makes a motion to resign from your case, and this judge hoists $40,000 in legal fees onto you which covers what was necessary to have your attorney turn against you. Your millionaire husband meanwhile pays nothing! 5. Judge Drager puts a "gag order" on your case, so you can't defend yourself. This "gag order" is based on all of the negative press, Judge Drager Puts Out there. 6. Judge Drager attacks your children, so the woman has to focus on something else, while she steals your assets. If your child goes to private school she will call the school and have your child thrown out! So much for the security and continuity of the child..Judge Drager has bigger fish to fry. 7. Judge Drager steals your multi-million dollar piece of real estate and devours it. Her network of Lawyers, Court Reporters and others get paid! 8. Judge Drager throws you and your children out onto the street! That's the the Drager "shakedown". Better than the Hokey Pokey Hundreds Have Gone to to Vote Her Off the Bench: Remove Judge Drager from Bench&&&1

Capriles, 40, ran against Chavez last year and lost. But he mounted one of the fiercest challenges during the late president's 14 years in power. "My fight is not to be president. My fight is for Venezuela to move forward," Capriles said Sunday night. On Monday, he also filed paperwork to run for the presidency.&&&16

Healthy Gay Men Must Be Allowed to Donate Blood, Says GMHC&&&The current policy is not based on good science but rather on fear and prejudice. Risk screening should be used to separate out anyone who has engaged in high risk behavior rather than focusing on sexual orientation. While the current policy made sense before reliable testing was developed, now that we have such testing the current policy makes no sense. Anyone can carry HIV and pass it on. But having the virus is required for passing it on. People who are not infected cannot pass the virus, no matter what they do. There is no reason to exclude people who are not infected and have not had the opportunity to become infected in a year. While the virus can go undetected for a month or more, the new policy would require no risk of exposure within a year, which is plenty of time to develop the antibodies which would show up in the repeated testing. The population at risk is those who have had the risk of contracting the disease within the past year. That includes heterosexual people as well as gay and bi people. There is no need to exclude those who have no risk within the past year and have been tested.&&&102

Steps to NY Judge Drager's Corrupt Shakedown!..t's better than the Hokey Pokey&&&The Steps of Judge Drager's Corrupt "Shakedown" to Unlawfully Seizing Assets NY's Women Work A Lifetime, To Have Assets Seized Unlawfully By Judge ....Steps of Judge Drager's Corrupt Shakedown. It is a right of passage, when Judge Drager is your Judge at your Divorce. You must put up your "real estate" as a sacrifice to the Drager god. Judge Drager has to pay her bills! Paying off lawyers, public relations experts to submerge negative text is an expensive proposition. This corrupt Judge has quite a network in place to steal a woman's assets. The process is as follows: 1. Judge Drager throws negative stories in the press about an accomplished woman to destroy her credibility. 2. She Allows the "Money" Spouse to break the law and not pay child support for years, to strangle the woman to death financially 3. Judge Drager buys or threatens your attorney to work against you, and then when you have a problem with it she throws more negative information in the Press to show that you are difficult to deal with. 4. Judge Drager puts a "gag order" on your case, so you can't defend yourself. This "gag order" is based on all of the negative press, Judge Drager Puts Out there. 5. Judge Drager attacks your children, so the women has to focus on something else, while she steals your assets. 6. Judge Drager steals your multi-million dollar piece of real estate and devours it. Her network of Lawyers, Court Reporters and others get paid! 7. Judge Drager throws you and your children out onto the street! That's the the Drager "shakedown" Hundreds Have Gone to to Vote Her Off the Bench: Remove&&&1

Accord between JPMorgan, MF Global parent gets court approval&&&You seriously cannot make this shit up. I was actually laughing reading this. Shows how stupid people really are and how they got robbed. Just prior to the collapse of MF Global,$1.6B was stolen from private segregated accounts and shuffled around to pay off debts to bigger financial institutions. JP Morgan Chase branch in London England had over $650M of the 1.6B stolen. The people that got ripped off in the theft have been able to recoup maybe 60% of their investments that John Corzine stole. He committed fraud and instead of going to jail, he gets to throw fund raising campaign dinners for Obama. Now did JP Morgan have to turn they $650M+ over to bankruptcy for funds distribution to all of those that got ripped off? Nope. So they keep your stolen funs and now bankruptcy court approves a settlement of 73% from left over monies. So they get to keep your money that was stolen and get to keep majority of the money from the bankruptcy. This is freaking comical. And nobody goes to jail for fraud or theft.&&&12

New Family Structures Study Intended To Sway Supreme Court On Gay Marriage, Documents Show&&&Because procreation intent, ability, and even ability to have sex are specifically not required for marriage, what you can imagine as the best family, is irrelevant.

The desire to hold same sex couples to a far higher and impossible standard, demonstrates this is about prejudice, not fairness.&&&11

Gun Control Laws and Legislation: Where Does Pennsylvania Stand?&&&Alex Jones brought up a good point on his December 17, 2012 show that most people won't talk about. Listen to the first hour of the podcasted show. Why are hard leftists like Diane Feinstein, Chuck Schummer, and Michael Bloomberg -part of the Israeli lobby in America- trying to disarm America. They are the loudest voices going after the second ammendmant right now in America but openly lobby for US taxpayers to arm Israelis so they can defend themselves. And yes, Israel has a right to defend itself but so do Americans. The Connetecuit shootings were a horrific tragedy but going after the second ammendmant is not the answer. These mass shootings always happen where there are strict gun control laws and the public is disarmed -remember criminals will always find access to guns whether they are outlawed or not and innocent civilians are usually the victims of mass shootings. The answer to these mass shootings is to train and arm responsable US civilians including trusted school faculty on how to defend students from any crazies that show up until cops arrive. We need less guns in the hands of criminals and more guns in the hands of innocent law abiding citizens who are trained how to responsibly own and use firearms. Isnt't it wierd how after the election all of a sudden all these shootings take place and now gun control is at the top of the headlines. You have the NFL (Bob Costas), news media figures, and national politicians now engaging in a full court press for gun control. Look how the corporate media is promoting that guns be taken away so Americans citizens can't defend themselves from all forms of criminals. The media is being absolutely transparent in its attempt to brainwash Americans into believeing that we don't have the right to defend ourselves with the second ammendmant. This should alarm all American citizens given the fact our government has been seized by Communist revolutionaries backed with offshore corporate fascist money. These bought out political revolutionaries within our illegitimiate federal government are now aggitating the rest of the world and garnering hatred against America from countries like Russia, China, South America, and the Middle East. The type of facism that is now being pushed in America was used in Stalanist Russia, Cuba, Nazi Germany, Fascist Argentina, Corrupt Mexico, to name a few examples. It's the same gameplan now being used on America. And every time a country was destroyed and remade into a failed state/dictatorship it started by disarming the general public so people could get bullied by the tyrants into further authoritarianism with no way to fight back. Now is not the time to disarm America. Pull your money out of the major banks so they can't create derivatives with it and put it in local credit unions or small banks. Call out/ vote out politicians that want to disarm America and boycott the corporate media by turning to non corporate news. If these politicians want gun control why don't they get rid of their personal entourage of taxpayer paid for armed security/bodygaurds. They want gun control for citizens, not themselves. Americans can put a stop to this tyrany as most people are now waking up from their trances because the tyranny is so in your face. The New World Order lackeys must be nuts to think this gameplan will work in America for very long being this blatant. Americans of all political persuasion will never disarm -we are not stupid. Liberal or conserative we just love our freedom too damn much.&&&786

Guild Wars 2 Final with invisible players in www.gw2gold.net&&&On the upcoming update of 26 March 2013, ArenaNet wants to fix the display time in the World vs World of Guild Wars 2. &#12288;&#12288;It is arguably one of the strange emotions in MMORPGs. When you look at a vast landscape, it cannot see any other adventurers nearby. Yet this is not a necessary phenomenon that indicates a Guild Wars 2 gold[http://www.gw2gold.net]pl ayer loss, as the case of Guild Wars 2 has proved that. There makes the phenomenon of display delay for emptiness. In the light effect, fireballs and other capabilities testify to the activity of other characters, however, the bodies themselves remain hidden. This is particularly a problem in the World vs World. But the update on 26 March 2013 will break with the tradition of the unsightly display delay. &#12288;&#12288;The display delay is a home-made problem, which was introduced by the developers in order to conserve system resources.

To save the hospitality industry, Texas has to deal with illegal immigration&&&This is exactly what Las Vegas and all of Nevada has been facing forever. But part's of Nevada have had chain migration for at least 35 years and green cards were issued to hundreds. Hospitality in Nevada and the entire economy would fail if they hadn't hired thousands of illegals. Illegal immigration has literally bankrupted parts of Nevada, because for every illegal hired there, they cost the State millions in EBT, food Stamps, unemployment, work comp claims, foreclosures as they sold to illegals with fake ID'S. I know this, because I have family that has been forced to employ them for year's and years. And if you reprimand them for anything, they scream the race card. They have a dangerous mind set and have virtually taken over Nevada and the Lawmakers have been forced to abide, because of hospitality. Or Maids and Construction. One gal had several kids over 7 year's and was excited to announce to my family member she received over 12 thousands dollars in child tax credit's. She receives subsidized housing, EBT for all her anchor's. Had only made about 13 thousand dollars in income, lives out o wedlock. Get's free healthcare for her kids and proud to be getting a New Cad. Escalade. While we the tax payers get nothing... This is why I'm on this forum. I want Americans to know what they've been doing.

Village In the Woods Cooperative Selden NY&&&It is time Village in the Woods Coop becomes a NON SMOKING COOP. New York Real Property Law (RPL)� 235-b implies that in every residential lease, a warranty of habitability under which a landlord warrants that the premises are �fit for human habitation,� and that tenants are not �subjected to any conditions which would be dangerous, hazardous, or detrimental to their life, health or safety,� including conditions occasioned by acts of third parties. In 2006, the New York City Civil Court held in Poyck v. Bryan, that secondhand smoke from a neighboring apartment qualifies as a condition that invokes the protections of RPL�235?b. Citing a recent report by the U.S. Surgeon General declaring that breathing secondhand smoke poses a significant health hazard, the court noted that secondhand smoke is just as insidious and invasive as other conditions which have previously been found to violate RPL�235-b, including noxious odors, smoke odors, chemical fumes, excessive noise, water leaks, and extreme dust penetration. �To comply with its duties under � 235-b, a co-op board must make reasonable efforts to eliminate or alleviate the hazardous condition, such as taking steps to prevent the neighbors from smoking in the hallway and elevators, taking preventive care to properly ventilate the neighbor�s unit so that the secondhand smoke does not seep into the tenant�s apartment and sealing cracks in smoking units. If a co-op board fails to take these or similar measures, a tenant may ask a court to order the board to take steps to remedy the problem or to award a maintenance abatement, and the tenant may be entitled to legal fees.&&&2

Israel has the right idea: there are armed guards at EVERY school ready to react immediately. This is a major deterrent; and even IF some nut decides to try to shoot kids, the quick response of people shooting back will surely minimize casualties. With so many military veterans and other qualified people out of work, it's a no-brain-er to establish a protective force at every school in the U.S. If we can pay TSA gropers to annoy us at airports, we can surely afford to protect our children.&&&31

The Federal Reserve is pumping in billions of dollars a month at near 0% interest rates. This is what is pushing up the markets. Cheap digital money. Now why are they saying inflation is low then? Because everyone else is doing the same. China, Japan, Russia, the EU, India, name it. They all are debasing their currencies. Reason for this, we are in the middle of a currency war and interest rate bubble. Everyone is debasing their currency in order to make their exports cheaper. Welcome in then the Trade Wars.&&&1
Proposed Dem Budget Increases Spending 62% Over Next Decade&&&And the democrats release their budget, where are the spending cuts? Remember they were going to raise taxes and give us promised spending cuts yet they want to spend the new revenue as fast as it comes in so they can borrow trillions more from the Chinese. Unprecedented recklessness from our democrat party but is anyone really surprised?&&&7
Fighting terrorism: How to handle the king pin who masterminded Sabah attack?&&&How should it be handled? Is it still debatable that the attack in Sabah by Filipino Muslim gunmen earlier this month is terrorism or not? I think all the facts confirm that it is an act of terrorism. Many people in the world agree that it is obviously a terrorist attack! The kingpin of the Pinoy Muslims groups which attacked Sabah is Sultan of Sulu Kiram III who is not an official of the Philippines govt. Either his act of sending gunmen to attack Sabah is tolerated or indirectly endorsed by Manila, or he should be captured by the Filipino police force and extradicted to Malaysia for justice. On the other hand, Manila can turn over this ringleader to international police. Mr. Kiram III masterminded or incited terrorist acts, and he must be held legally accountable for what happened in Sabah, Malaysia. That is how terrorism should be handled in order to combat terrorism. That is analogous to the capture and killing of Bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders. But Manila does not do anything except complaining that Filipino gunmen were not treated in the proper manner down there in Sabah. Does it mean that Manila is endorsing or sympathetic with terrorism?&&&1

Retired Justice Stevens to receive Brandeis Medal&&&The Brandeis Medal is, really, an award that recognizes a liberal's attempts to undermine our tradition of self-reliance, individual responsibility to provide for ourselves and our families, keep government small, non-intrusive, limited, and supportive of the intent of the Founders of our great nation. Furthermore, where is the honor in receiving an award that is shared by the likes of Janet Reno, one of the worst Attorneys General in our nation's history? Or Sandra Day O'Connor who turned her back on her purported conservative views to embrace the ludicrous philosophy of liberalism that undermines individual freedom and liberty?&&&1

Diverse high court families mirror country&&&"Mirror the country " ?! The writer of tis article is either on drugs or is insane. The present make up of SCOTUS IN NO WAY "mirrors the country". For example, the U.S. IS, and ALWAYS HAS BEEN, a Protestant-majority country. Yet, NONE of the present SCOTUS JUSTICES are Protestants ! A MAJORITY of the people in the U.S. are Protestants. About 21% of the U.S. population is Roman Catholic, yet 67% of SCOTUS justices are Roman Catholic, and Jews make up about 2% of the U.S. population, yet, fully 33% of the SCOTUS justices are Jews. And while MORE THAN 50% of the U.S. population identifes themselves as Protestants, ZERO PERCENT of SCOTUS justices are Protestant. So to say that the SCOTUS members "mirror the country" is at best "laughable", and at worst, a "blatant lie".&&&4

Why there are low expectations for President Obama&#x26;rsquo;s visit to Israel&&&Low expectations indeed. Obama will probably claim in Israel that the Iranian ballistic missiles with North Korean technology are peaceful and do not endangers Israel, America or the world. Undoubtedly, the Israelis are different that the liberal Jewish leaders that finance Obama�s election campaign and cannot care less about Israel security and its capital Jerusalem that Obama removed from the maps of Israel. Clearly, more than 67% of the Israeli Jews do not trust Obama�s running down the clock in the fourth quarter of the Iranian nukes as he nominated Chuck Hagel as the pacifist that6 will continue to talk softly to the deceitful Iranian regime about peace when the nuclear bombs and WMDs could be used by the suicide bombing terrorists sponsored by the Iranian regime against Israel as well as America. Obama�s obsessed support of the Mozlem Brotherhood regimes in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria which are behind the expansion of al Qaida in Africa and Asia is well known to Israelis who considers Obama�s pushing forward the Shariya law fanatic regimes and their terrorist organizations as part of the Caliphate agenda that will rule the entire Middle East and Africa. Therefore Obama can make empty promises to the liberal delusional Jews of America about peaceful Iranian regime while blaming the aggressive PM Netanyahu and majority Israeli supporters who will not hesitate to destroy the Iranian regime in order to save the Jews from new holocaust by the evil Mozlem Brother regime of Iran.&&&2

Sheriff Terry Maketa to file charges against Colorado Democrat leadership&&&Whatever county the offendind email was delivered to-that jurisdictional sheriff should pursue a court search warrant based on probable cause for related evidence and conspiracy within/beyond the legislature and, and arrest and charge the offender for extortion. Failure to act allows the corruption to duck and hide the conspiracy. Soon it becomes heresay and whte collar criminals are very good at manipulating there way out of the facts. The sheriffs should have done this before going public. The surprise bust of the corruption in the legislature. They don.t go public before any other crime investigation/search warrant arrest-leading to conclusion the Sheriffs were very intimidated by the legally powerful and or illegally powerful government. Could lead to a civil suit for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional anguish upon the sheriffs by the legislators involved individually. Go get em Sheriffs-otherwise corruption becomes the usurper of our constitutional rights.&&&1

Barletta: Secure the Borders Before Addressing Illegal Immigrants&&&"And when the 20 million (or so) newly minted residents come forth, the burden on our already sagging economy will be disastrous.

As the nation teeters on the edge of financial ruin, these are more costs that we simply cannot sustain." Finally the truth!!! The House will never pass this amnesty!&&&5

Pope Francis Kidnapping Controversy: Accused of 1976 Abductions&&&Pope Francis Kidnapping Controversy: Jorge Mario Bergoglio Accused Of Involvement In 1976 Abductions The election of Pope Francis, previously Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has resurfaced a decades-old controversy surrounding the kidnappings of two Jesuit priests. Bergoglio was a high-ranking official in the Society of Jesus of Argentina when a military junta was installed in the South American country in 1976. According to the Los Angeles Times, priests Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics were kidnapped in May of that year by the navy. "They surfaced five months later, drugged and seminude, in a field," the Times reported. A 2005 lawsuit accused Bergoglio of unspecified involvement in the abductions. Reuters explains that "the military government secretly jailed [Yorio and Jalics] for their work in poor neighborhoods." P.S. some are born with spiritual immune systems that sooner or later give rejection to the illusory worldview grafted upon them from birth through social conditioning. They begin sensing that something is amiss, and start looking for answers. Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening.

These organizations and our legislators are a disgrace and an insult to everyone who boards a plane.&&&1

Fighting Joe lied. If the gun is purchased at the gun show from a dealer, they are still required to run the background check.

The Democrats attacks on Christianity will cost them dearly in the future and there is no way for them to lie out of it, unless of course Pope Francis is Pro- infanticide, Pro- Homosexual, Pro- Abortion and Pro- Dope smoking.

Undocumented Immigrants May Soon Be Eligible for Driver's Licenses&&&�I think the biggest risk is my husband driving without a license. My fear is that something could happen to him.

That aside, these pro driver's license people equate a license with safe driving. HAH! Does this also mean that illegal aliens will be paying the higher insurance premium for illegal aliens (ins. co. will not lose $ on these turkeys), will no longer drink and drive, nor flee from the scene of an accident!!! These are people who have NEVER been law abiding since they got here. They have committed identity theft, fraud, and on and on. But now, getting a driver's license will solve everything!!! Doubtful! What I am seeing is a gradual increase in illegal alien privileges behind our backs. Tuition decreases, drivers licenses...what's left? We owe them nothing!!! They created this situation knowing full well that the outcome would not be to their liking...and when the hammer comes down, it's discrimination or some such poppy cock!&&&2
Abortion, gay marriage take centre stage in South Carolina&&&All you need to know is that all of them except Huntsman, who is not a factor because he says he trusts in scientists, have signed a "personhood" pledge which supports the banning of any after fertilization form of birth control.

GOP budget takes aim again at Obamacare, Medicaid&&&Obama is in full election campaign mode and in reckless mode of 'spend today on votes and forget about tomorrow' since his election in 2009 as Obama needs more money to buy votes of 30 million more Americans with free food stamps, Obama phone and free healthcare to defeat GOP in the 2014 elections. On the other hand GOP Congress is worrying about the destruction of America from bankruptcy, they offer cuts in the budget while they do not think it will hurt then in 2014 elections. Evidently, more than half of the Americans getting free Obama check every month for the rest of their lives cannot care less about the fall of America to bankruptcy as long as Obama keep sending them money that he cuts from the US Military and making it the most dysfunctional military in US history. Harry Reid is a despicable and disgraceful mentally sick liberal who will spend every trillion dollar that he can still get from China and Saudi Arabia and use it to buy votes of the more than 30 million parasites of the Blacks, Hispanic and Asians that do not want to work and will vote for Obama in 2014 in return for food stamps for lifetime.&&&1

Aftermath of Sabah attacks: The global PR campaign the Filipino way !&&&As of yesterday, more than 60 Pinoy Sulu gunmen were killed and the rest are still defiant. They refuses to lay down their weapons to surrender to Malaysia Armed Forces. That is the sad ending for cruel troublemakers who killed Sabahan policemen and innocent villagers and mutilated their bodies. It is clear such Pinoys are very barbarous. In the beginning those big shots in Manila were wishy washy about what to say. Some try to keep the Sulu fighters at arm's length and took a low profile in dealing with the international press. A few days after that they were sure that the majority of Pinoys are in favour of taking Sabah back and many are sympathetic with the Sulu fighters. Now the politicians and Filipino media launch a global smearing campaign, against Malaysia complaining that Malaysia has abused the Sulu fighter's human rights. Therefore Malaysis is wrong. They have forgotten who have stirred up this trouble. Why aren't they showing the familes of Malaysian victims some sympathy? Where are the basic human rights of these poor Malaysians who were killed just in the wrong place the wrong time? Now the Pinoys try hard to portray themselves as victims of Malaysia aggression. rmed Forces!!!&&&1

WRAPUP 2-Dueling budget plans debut in U.S. Congress&&&Another NY Embarrassment:Chief Judge Does PR Spin for Corrupt Judge Drager..why? Judge Lippman Does PR Damage Control for Corrupt Judge Drager...WHY? Instead of Judge Lippman Addressing The Corruption of Judge Laura Drager, her "divorce company" and her ignoring gun threats and other violence toward children, Judge Lippman is doing a subtle PR Campaign for the "Judicial Madame" of the Power Brokers. Judge Laura Drager, CEO of New York's Divorce Company is pulling out the Public Relations stops. Today's New York Daily News, has done a ridiculous puff piece about Judge Drager keeping a custody proceeding open of a rich couple. Judge Laura Drager, is known for ignoring Gun Violence Towards Children, domestic violence and for Unlawfully Seizing Hundreds of Millions of dollars in Property from Innocent Women, should be investigated for her criminal sub par behavior as a jurist Who is paying for Judge Drager's Public Relations Campaign?&&&1
Cop Crimes: Child Porn/Causing Death of 7 Y.O./ More&&&Arrested: Fl. Police union leaders face racketeering charges At least three are in custody following a multi-agency illegal gambling investigation. Federal Appeals Court Busts Police For Contempt Of Cop Arrest A motorist who was less than cooperative when police performed a traffic stop on her property was vindicated Friday. A federal appeals court made it clear that taking a longer than expected time to produce identification and "being up to no good," was not grounds for arrest. In an unpublished ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit allowed Gina Petithomme to sue the Miami-Dade, Florida police department over the treatment she received at the hands of officers on February 6, 2009. Officers Ronald Martin and Jesus Gonzalez had been dispatched to investigate a suspicious White Dodge with two black men inside at the corner of 148th Street and Northwest 10th Place. Before reaching that location, the officers saw a silver Nissan with a piece of white paper allegedly blocking the license plate. The Nissan was parked on private property. Petithomme, a black woman, was inside the Nissan when officers came on her property to say they were investigating a suspicious vehicle. "What was the description of the vehicle?" Petithomme asked. The officers did not say they were looking for a white Dodge, and asked Petithomme to produce identification and for permission to search her vehicle. Petithomme refused the search. On a third request for identification, Petithomme asked if she could go inside her home to retrieve it. It was granted, and as soon as she left the officers began searching through the Nissan. She returned and upon being asked a fourth time, she said the license must be in her car. She finally found it. "Here's my identification," Petithomme said, holding within Officer Martin's line of vision. Enraged, Officer Martin arrested Petithomme on the spot, charging her with disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. The officers said the woman's attitude showed she was "up to no good." The court of appeals disagreed. "Plaintiff's questions directed to...(more) Phoenix Cop Made Famous On YouTube For Tackling 15-Yr-Old Girl Calls 5-Day Suspension Too Harsh Undercover Cops Ensnare a Special Ed Student, Get Him Expelled Woman injured in LAPD manhunt says cops won't pay taxes on replacement truck cont,&&&2

&#65314;loody urbanization in China&&&Everyone is talking about when the housing bubble bursts in China. I think it will, but not very soon. Right now, China is expecting to expand economy by urbanization of its large rural population. However, urbanization is not simply to replace old houses with high skyscrapers. Many citizens become victims as their houses are threatened to be removed by local governments. The following news tells what is happening in a small town, Cangzhou (Hebei province), a city 150 miles from the capital, Beijing. Li, Huanling a 72-year-old man, lives in Dajinzhuang, Yunhe District of Cangzhou. He and his many other neighbors are under pressure to leave their house so the local government can build large skyscrapers. Li is elderly and not completely mobile. He and his family have lived in the current house for many years. It will be difficult and painful for him to move to a skyscraper. Li and his many neighbors are trying to remain in their house but there are hired thugs that have been continually harassing them by using explosives and closing essential utilities including water and electricity. They had petitioned many times to local governments, but nothing has been resolved. The violence escalated last month when his son (Li, Baocheng), who is trying to help, was attacked and stabbed with knives multiple times so that he nearly died. This story is just a representative of many tragedies behind the so-called miracle economy in China. Chinese governments are making the largest housing bubble in human history. However, no matter when the housing bubble bursts, human rights should be always protected in the process of urbanization.&&&1

If I ever lied or stole, my dad cared enough to correct me on the seat of my learning, and for that I greatly respected him and stayed on the straight and narrow. The reason he left my mom each day was to work hard as a carpenter and provide food for our table. And that animal he killed... It was a large bird that had been struck by a car and had been left to die on the side of the road. He put the poor animal out of its misery, and it grieved him to do so. With that knowledge you can now see that my dad wasn�t a tyrant. He was a loving and kind father. Richard Dawkins believes that God is more than just a tyrant. He said,�The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.� But there�s some missing information he�s not giving you that changes everything�for those who will listen. This same morally perfect and holy Creator (whose seeming harsh judgments were always �righteous and true altogether�) became a morally perfect human being. He did this to save us from the same just wrath that spilled upon the wicked nations of the Old Testament. Most of us know that Jesus of Nazareth gave His life as a sacrifice for the sin of the world. What they don�t know is that we violated God�s Law (the Ten Commandments) and justly deserve the wrath of the moral Law, but Jesus paid our fine in full. That means that God can legally dismiss our case. He can commute our death sentence and let us live forever, because our fine was paid by Another who then rose from the dead. The same holy God who considers lust to be adultery and hatred to be murder, made provision for His great love and mercy to be extended towards those who repent and trust in the Savior. For the Christian, the cross of Jesus Christ shows that God isn�t the wicked tyrant that foolish and ignorant men make Him out to be. It is the missing information that changes everything.

Invalid UNCLOS actions against China by greedy Pinoys !&&&Why the international law shouldn�t be an option to resolve China-Philippines row? Posted on December 11, 2012 by Regel Javines [http ://rqjavines.wordpress. com /tag/territorial-dispute-under -unclos/] The disputed waters in South China Sea.. Formally, international laws serve as guidelines or standards in resolving disputes, crises, and inconsistencies between nations and states. International laws, quite essentially, should not undermine or question existing laws and historic domains a sovereign state already has. In other words, it should be tailored accordingly to what interest most to the general welfare in the international scope. Thus, it should be presumed that international laws must be perfected according to what is just, legal, and proper, and thus, should also be considered that they must be consistent to equality, justice, and sovereignty. The Philippines has become steadfast in resolving the issue through the intervention of an international law such as the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS. On the contrary, China wanted it to resolve by a bilateral talk or process. Now, what makes it unlikely to resolve the row either by these two ways? Probably, there are only two apparent reasons: 1.Through international law, the issue is obviously favorable to the Philippines, and in the contrary is calamitous to China�s historic claim. 2.Through a bilateral talk or process, the issue might be unclear to both parties on where they must go, and the tendency to either giving in or giving up is safe to say obscure. And the most probable end result from this process would be: �The Philippines should either respect or cooperate with China in return for economic or political and security (of course, a clandestine deal). �Or else, the row would continue to swell indefinite. Territorial disputes, categorically, can only be solved through international laws if and only if the said law is beneficial and equitable to both disputing parties after considering the multifaceted factors involved.&&&2

With or without Keystone pipeline, oil will roll into U.S.&&&"There is no permitting required � you can put oil on rail and nobody can complain," said Sandy Fielden of RBN Energy, a Houston-based consulting firm that has tracked the oil-by-rail boom. Transportation or Transport Law encompasses federal and state laws governing the conveyance of passengers or goods, especially as a commercial enterprise, pertaining to both the method and the means. It includes highways, mass transit, aviation, rail, maritime and motor carriers. It also covers traffic safety, hazardous materials and pipelines. Public carriers such as airlines and shipping lines are also subject to state and federal legislation. The laws that govern drivers are largely state created and governed. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) establishes overall transportation policy for the U.S. The Department works with applicable state and local offices to decide policy regarding highway planning, development and construction; urban mass transit; railroads; aviation; and the safety of ports, highways and oil and gas pipelines. There are several other federal agencies that govern transportation law, including the Federal Highway Administration, The Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, The Federal Maritime Commission and others. Can you tell why just follow the money.&&&1

I am surprised or disappointed that the black community hasn't risen up to march on the morons in city hall and police department to demand an end to the BLACK drug gang violence. State, county, city law enforcement all ignore the problem. The lack of leadership in black community is amazing, where in the hell did all the leaders go?? So how will this killing end?? will the national guard have to be called in to go house to house to collect the guns, drugs, arrest the killers?? Chicago is becoming a second class Detroit a city in ruin. they may have to bulldoze the whole south side, start over with new people who care about the city and themselves.&&&7

stop bear biling........&&&Over 10,000 WSPA supporters also signed our recent petition calling for an end to bear farming in South Korea � an issue the South Korean Government is due to discuss this month. Every one of the thousands of animal lovers who signed up to support WSPA�s Stop Bear Bile Farming campaign told the world why they want bear bile farming to stop. All of these messages speak out passionately against the physical and mental anguish that over 12,000 bears endure at the hands of the bear bile industry. Bear bile is extracted from the bears� gallbladder, often through a permanent channel carved into their abdomen in an act of horrific mutilation. It is sold as an ingredient for medicines, beauty products and even wine. This cruel industry continues, despite the existence of proven synthetic and herbal alternatives to bear bile. Support WSPA�s Stop Bear Bile Farming campaign WSPA is determined to stop the bear bile industry and is calling on all animal lovers to help. You can help by speaking out about the cruelty of bear bile farming by writing your own message about why you want bear bile farming to stop. By speaking out about the horrors of bear bile farming you will alert others to this issue and help WSPA to step up our efforts, and do everything we can to stop the bear bile trade. You can help WSPA campaign against bear bile farming by donating to WSPA�s Stop Bear Bile Farming Fund.&&&2

Jeb Bush's line on immigration reform&&&Jeb Bush shouldn�t be writing anything on immigration, a field he knows little or nothing of. This is a story that needs to be told by men and women who have been there, traversed the globe in search of a habitat. Well documented immigrants, should be informing the people of what goes on in the immigration world. Immigrants who are not ready to skew the story to their own favour should be helping others understand this topic. This will lead societies into making the right decisions concerning immigration and immigrants. Growing resentments against immigrants is all because of misinformation peddled by uninformed communicators. I speak from an experienced point of view. I have lived in several countries across the globe. After all my ordeals, illicit trades, I am neither in support nor against immigration. I would however opine that societies make their immigration laws based on whether or not it is beneficial to them. My book,�Evicted from My Space�,(at leading online bookstores) to me, should be a paraphernalia to governments and individuals who want to delve into the secret places of an immigrant�s situation.&&&3

Supreme Court urged to support gay marriage limits&&&The federal DOMA statute is CLEARLY unconstitutional because it violates the "full faith and credit" clause of the U.S. Constitution. Now if a state wishes to NOT legalize same-sex marriages within it's borders, they should have that right. But in recognizing a state's right to legislate it's own marriage laws, ALL states MUST legally recognize ALL the marriages of ALL other states, and other jurisdictions in the U.S., INCLUDING same-sex marriages performed in the states and other jurisdictions that permit them, AS PER the "full faith and credit" clause of the U.S. Constitution. If you are going to make an exception for same-sex marriage, then what is to stop a state, or the federal government from not legally recognizing the marriage sof first cousins ? Or 13 year olds ? Legal chaos will result if ALL marriages are NOT legally recognized by the federal government, and the states, and other jurisdictions in the U.S.&&&287

Why Rand Paul refused a TSA pat down, missed flight to D.C.&&&Republicans Intentions; Get rid of Rand paul he is a nut case; I think it is obvious they want to return us to the pre 1929 era and if possible to the pre 1900's when there were no rules whatsoever and nothing for the the poor or the so called middle class except the rule of the robber barons. Look in the older history books who tell of company foremen telling the employees on the eve of an election day not to bother to return to work at all if William Jennings Bryan - Democrat - were elected President. Good Republican tactics that our present day practitioners of that philosophy do sell their souls to have return. They should not be called conservatives, they are reactionaries who, indeed, as you imply have not had an idea since the mid 1800's. Thank the Lord they were not around in 1776. They would have joined forces with George III in their "conservatism". They look to the "good old days" when according to Hollywood everyone lived on a tree lined street in a two story mansion. Check your family history. How many of our great greats did. That was the maybe .05%. Since the founding of the Republic the struggle of the 99% has had maybe four or five allies namely Teddy Roosevelt (R), FDR (D), Harry Truman (D), Lyndon Johnson (D), Kennedy (D) and that is that. Perhaps our arguably greatest President, A Lincoln (R) should be included since he engineered the freeing of a large portion of our population from the filth of outright slavery. But what Republican since has done a thing for the general welfare of the people. They have only opposed anything and everything except that which benefits the 1%. Look at our present Congress - they crow about doing away with the minimum wage, medicare, social security and unions. CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY.&&&82

So, here is my comment that I already had posted but now cannot be seen (article at: ): UM, giving free aid to Illegal Alien Students DOES affect aid given to CA residential students. This is all too often denied when it is a fact that while the NUMBER of Cal Grants given to CA Residential Students does not change, the AMOUNT of the award has and will be diminished. Berkely's own student newspaper admitted this as such: -... It's also interesting to note that Cesar Chavez (The Center where the pics were taken) was adamantly opposed to Illegal Aliens because they hindered his work for justice for Farm Workers.&&&3

Senate Finally Confirms John Brennan As CIA Director&&&Chalk up another win for President Obama� It is just so amusing to watch the right once again have a hissy fit over �something Obama� and in the end get absolutely nothing out of it. Rand Paul with his induced blather infection (hopefully) stood on the senate floor for 12 hours 52 minutes (he wasn�t even man enough to make it 13 hours) to cry about Obama�s Killer Drones because he was afraid that Obama would send them to take out unpatriotic treasonous terrorist tea-baggers in this country (if there is a God, PLEASE make it so) but AG Holder sent him a 2 sentence letter that shut him down, LOL� and Brennan is CIA Director, just like Obama wanted. But what makes this just so sweet is that John McCain came out to the Senate floor to chastise Paul for his pathetic stunt, LOL, I love it. Check-Mate you fools!&&&21

Too much money spent in Iraq for too few results&&&Greatest Joke of year 2013!! As if GWB the Great went there to Rebuilt Iraq.

Did GWB the Great paid from his pocket? (And who knows how much Iraqi oil passed under hands in those years of turmoil?) And who cares for close to 1 Million Iraqi dead during the time US "ruled" there? Mission Accomplished a. Saddam Dead b. Iraqis enjoying "Democracy" and living in virtual Paradise. c.

And by which hand to hold hand grenade and not be stupid to keep on holding it too long after removing the pin....and do not throw it is the direction of your friends!! e.

Ohio woman claims she was fired for Obama vote&&&Before the whiny liberals get started, a la Larry and the usual suspects, as I said on another thread on this topic, she has not been discriminated against in the protected sense. Discrimination in that her employer didn't like her destructive political choice for president? Yes, but that is not illegal. I presume (maybe incorrectly) that she is an at will employee, which means she can be fired for any reason or no reason so long as it is not one for which there is lawful protection. Those protections are race, religion, sex, color, national origin, family status, disability, veterans and genetics. Stupid choices is not on the list, so the business is on firm ground here.&&&221

Sen. Chuck Grassley: HSBC should face criminal charges&&&Where is Phil Gramm? Since 2002, Gramm has been an executive with the U.S. operations of UBS, the giant Swiss Bank. At UBS, Gramm held the post of vice chairman, a position Michelle Leder dubbed in these pages as "the greatest job in business" for its combination of high status and low work rate. Gramm was a lobbyist and adviser, not an operating executive. U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, whose wife sits on Enron's board and audit committee, says he knew nothing about the energy company's precarious financial state in the months before it filed for bankruptcy, according to published reports. The senator told The Dallas Morning News in Wednesday's editions that he did not know of Enron's impending collapse because he and his wife do not discuss her business activities. "We talk about my taking out the garbage and Texas A&M football," he said in an article on the Houston Chronicle's Web site. One of Congress' biggest recipients of Enron campaign donations, Gramm has decided to remove himself from congressional hearings focusing on what went wrong at the company. But he will take part in more general inquiries into accounting standards, investor protection issues and other matters, spokesman Larry Neal said. The passage of the Gramm�Leach�Bliley Act, commercial banks, investment banks, securities firms, and insurance companies were allowed to consolidate. The banking industry had been seeking the repeal of the 1933 Glass�Steagall Act since the 1980s, if not earlier. In 1987 the Congressional Research Service prepared a report that explored the cases for and against preserving the Glass�Steagall act. Respective versions of the legislation were introduced in the U.S. Senate by Phil Gramm (Republican of Texas) and in the U.S. House of Representatives by Jim Leach (R-Iowa). The third lawmaker associated with the bill was Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.(R-Virginia), Chairman of the House Commerce Committee from 1995 to 2001. How convienient this crooked scumbag is at the center of corruption.&&&17

And in order to continue the Big Lie he was made VP during the Clinton administration.&&&11

There Is Little Hope Left of Keeping Global Temperature in the 'Safe' Zone&&&Extreme weather, which is "predicted" by climate scientists to occur more frequently as the atmosphere warms and CO2 levels rise, has already been seen widely in 2013.

Thirdly, Some report I've read stated that all the planets had higher surface temperatures. Fourthly, Is this the "kick off" of Obama's much touted, environmental campaign? And Lastly, To what extent does the govt already control the weather? Those of us with our ears to the ground know that the Govt maintains a large ELF (Extra low Frequency) generator somewhere in the in the northwest. ELF is known to affect cloud formations and weather problems. So when they say "Man made", just who are they talking about? My president was elected by dead people! Regards, Terri&&&12

Obama has lost the election. There is no way out for that hate spreading creep. If you youtube it, I'm sure you can find it. It's astonishing to watch.

Don't Pump Gas On April, 15 2013&&&I'll do it! If running low just get your gas the day before on April 14th or the day after April 16th. Every little bit helps. In April 1997, there was a "gas out" conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight. If everyone did not go the the pump on the 15th, it would take $2,292,000,000.00, almost 3 billion, out of the oil companies pocket. So please do not go to the gas stations on April 15th and let's tru to put a dent in the oil industry. Actually if at all possible go a whole week to try to not hit up a gas station. To lower the gas prices this should drop theme close to 70 cents to $1.&&&1

ACLU drops challenge to Kansas abortion law&&&Okay...here's the grief.... People have received a choice in this country if they want to kill or not. Some that want to kill call it health care, but that is besides the point. NOW, people who have received this choice to kill LEGALLY want it for free. Well someone has to pay. AND it shouldn't be someone who does not want to get involved nor does not want to ever kill. BUT since Obama CARE....people who wish to NOT kill can NO LONGER be free from that. Their choice is GONE...pretty much...because the only way that they can exercise their choice is to drop their own health insurance and suffer penalties from the government and also penalties from higher costs at facilities and very very possibly bankruptcy. This is pretty dog gone expensive. Where the one chooser's cost is in the $500 to $1000 range the other chooser's cost is ruinous!.. In this Kansas case, these choosers who want others to pay....well they lost that push. I say GOOD. But the right to act morally still does not exist in this country since Obama and gang came to town.&&&6

Senator Campfield Is Correct&&&Senator Campfield is correct, Gays are the biggest bullies of all. - The six ways homosexual activists manipulate public opinion Thu May 31, 2012 11:23 EST Comments (186) Tags: homosexuality May 31, 2012 - Anyone who is concerned about the influence of the homosexual agenda on reshaping traditional values must become intimately familiar with the major tactics that homophiles commonly employ in order to anticipate them and respond in charity and truth. Homophile strategists are very adept at manipulating public opinion with an arsenal of six tactics that are based upon deceptions and half-truths: Exploit the �victim� status; Use the sympathetic media; Confuse and neutralize the churches; Slander and stereotype Christians; Bait and switch (hide their true nature); and Intimidation. One reason these tactics have worked so well is that homophile activists have succeeded in marketing a harmless and friendly image of their movement. They have lulled people into thinking that the wider society will not be adversely affected by their radical social agenda. Homosexual strategists have, in many cases, toned down their extreme rhetoric and have cloaked their agenda in soothing language. Over time, however, many have begun to think of themselves and others as �homophobes� or �haters� if they oppose any aspect of the homosexual rights agenda � or, incredibly, even if they question it in their own minds. Generals and attorneys often wish that their opponents would write a book. Interestingly, leaders of the �homosexual rights� movement did exactly that. Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen clearly laid out this agenda in the marching orders of the movement, After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear & Hatred of Gays in the 90s.[1] This volume is an absolute treasure chest of information for those pro-family stalwarts who are actively engaged against the homosexual rights agenda. By far the most popular homophile tactic is the claim to victim status, which is a very powerful, almost paralyzing, weapon that gives them a distinct advantage in the public square. Kirk and Madsen summarize the potent effectiveness of the victim status: In any campaign to win over the public, gays must be portrayed as victims in need of protection so that straights will be inclined by reflex to adopt the role of protector.� The purpose of victim imagery is to make straights feel very uncomfortable; that is, to jam with shame the self-righteous pride that would ordinarily accompany and reward their antigay belligerence, and to lay groundwork for the process of conversion by helping straights identify with gays and sympathize with their underdog status.� the public should be persuaded that gays are victims of circumstance, that they no more chose their sexual orientation than they did, say, their height, skin color, talents, or limitations.� gays should be portrayed as victims of prejudice. Does this sound familiar? It does if one pays attention to any mainstream media coverage of these controversial issues as they play out in law and society. But the victim status requires a story to back it up. Thus, perhaps the most common lament of the garden-variety homophile revolves around the alleged �tidal wave of anti-gay� hate crimes.&&&22

50th Anniversary of JFK's Assassination--And Its Lasting Effect&&&I wanted to share this YouTube musical/visual presentation reflecting on the lasting effects of JFK's assassination almost 50 years ago. I co-wrote the song "Childhood's End" and assisted in the video production. I've been a lyricist/songwriter all my life, having the good fortune of working with a number of talented and gifted artists over the past 30+ years. The songwriting credit I'm most proud of is providing the words for Dr"Shadowland", a song co-written with Graham Nash and Joe Vitale that appeared on Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's first reunion album, "American Dream", certified platinum in 1989. I was hoping someone might connect with this song and visual production in some way. Unfortunately, these days many young people today aren't fully aware of the lasting effect President Kennedy's assassination has had on our country and the world over the past fifty years. As the saying goes, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it". I think it's critical for our future that this moment from our nation's history is never swept under the carpet of the changing times. We owe that much to our children, our children's children and the future generations that are here long after we are gone.. Kind regards, Rick Ryan&&&1

Judge: Town's speeding cameras are '3 Card Monty' scam&&&An Ohio judge says Elmwood Place's automated speed-traffic cameras are "a scam" that cheats drivers out of $105 a pop. If you happen to drive too fast through Elmwood Place, Ohio, the cards are stacked against you, according to a judge who calls the village's automated speeding camera "a scam that motorists can't win." Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Robert Ruehlman on Thursday ruled that the village's ordinance violated due process. He issued an injunction barring its enforcement. There have been numerous legal challenges across the U.S. to red-light camera laws but observers said this is the first ruling they know of striking down a municipality's speeding-camera law. "Speed-camera cases have been litigated but we have not come across one where a judge has said,'Stop this,'" attorney Mike Allen, whose firm brought the case, told MSN News on Friday. "I think it's going to touch off a firestorm around the country. I really do." Calls and emails by MSN News to Elmwood Place village officials and police Chief William Peskin were not immediately returned on Friday. Allen said he expects the village to appeal. Ruehlman sprinkled colorful language in his ruling striking down Elmwood's "automated speed enforcement program," which is carried out by Optotraffic, a Lanham, Md.-based company, under a contract with the village. Optotraffic gets a 40 percent cut of the revenues from fines it collects. The two cameras installed in town reportedly resulted in 6,600 speeding citations � three times the village's population -� at $105 a pop in the first month after enforcement began in September. The judge, who heard arguments in January, found that the ordinance fails to provide due process to people receiving a notice of fines in the mail. He said the village doesn�t have a sign warning motorists that traffic cameras are in operation, as required by state law. To challenge the $105 fine, a motorist has to pay $25 for a hearing that is "nothing more than a sham!" the judge wrote. At the hearing, he said, the "witness" for the village testifies from a report produced by the company that owns the speed-monitoring unit. Since the "witness" was not present when the alleged violation occurred, he or she can't be cross-examined, Ruehlman wrote. Page 1 of 2&&&2

"It's a weakness to look at the world 11,000 years ago, because those were sunlight-driven changes and not CO2-driven changes," Dr. Anderson said. Sunlight-related changes are gradual and vary across different parts of the globe; greenhouse-gas emissions trigger warming everywhere.&&&2

House GOP, Senate Dems To Unveil Competing Budget Plans Next Week&&&Lets see what Obama and the Senate have to offer, it should not be difficult, just move the spending cuts from the sequestered ones to cuts that make more sense. Obama can now have his �balanced� approach. In January, the GOP was forced to vote for a major tax hike with zero spending cuts. Now it is President Obama who has been forced to accept spending cuts with no tax hike. Who says divided government doesn�t work? Obama continues to complain of course and wants to replace some of the spending cuts with tax increases. The Simpson-Bowles Commission (Created by President BO) laid out what a �balanced� approach should entail:$3 of spending cuts for every $1 dollar in tax increases and if you do the math we have nearly met that mark. Only Obama wants the throw that away. Just a few weeks ago, as part of the fiscal-cliff deal, Congress approved $620 billion in tax hikes over ten years with no spending cuts. That means that to meet the 3-to-1 ratio, we should have a corresponding $1.86 trillion in spending cuts. But the sequester cuts just $1.72 trillion in spending over 10 years, according to Portman�s office. That is a ratio of just 2.78-to-1. We would need to cut an additional $138 billion, Portman calculates, in order to meet the 3-to-1 ratio recommended by Simpson-Bowles. There is nothing wrong with cutting $1.72 trillion from the federal budget. The problem with the sequester is that the cuts were not targeted � hitting vital programs (like national defense) and wasteful ones with equal force. For weeks, Obama tried to use the indiscriminate nature of the sequester to bludgeon Republicans into replacing some of the cuts with new tax revenues. But his dire warnings that criminals would be set free, teachers laid off, meat inspectors thrown off the job, air traffic controllers forced to abandon their posts backfired. It turned out most of his claims were exaggerated or flat untrue. And the false threats failed to deter Republicans from holding the line and demanding that the spending cuts be enacted in their entirety. Now Obama is making noises like he might back down. After issuing apocalyptic warnings of the plagues and pestilence would descend upon the land if the sequester took effect, on Friday he declared,�This is not going to be [an] apocalypse, as some people have said.�(Some people, Mr. President?) Instead of the end of the world, the sequester is now �just dumb.� Tthe �dumbness� of the sequester can easily be fixed, Obama has apparently agreed to sign a continuing resolution that locks in the sequester levels of spending and gives him flexibility to choose how and where to cut, so that vital programs are not adversely impacted. What this means is that, by sticking to their guns in the sequester showdown, Republicans have actually forced Obama into the �balanced approach� he called for but did not actually pursue. We are now almost at the Simpson-Bowles 3-to-1 ratio. Unfortunately, Washington is not doing it in a way that promotes growth. The cuts come from discretionary programs, when it is entitlement spending that is driving our long-term debt and deficits. And the revenues come from raising tax rates on small businesses and the wealthy, rather than lowering tax rates, eliminating preferences and simplifying the tax code. Still, keep in mind where Obama wanted to take the country. His original demand in the fiscal cliff negotiations last year was a $1.6 trillion tax paired with a $50 billion spending increase. Instead, a few months later, he got a $620 billion tax increase paired with a $1.72 trillion spending cut. From a conservative standpoint, that may be less than ideal.

Four months after marijuana legalization vote, feds remain mum&&&It was the will of the American people that legalized marijuana in CO and WA and it was the will of the American people that gave President Obama a second term. He can't now nullify one without severely undermining the legitimacy of the other! In the seventy years since the launch of the marijuana prohibition we've learned a few important things: 1.) The prohibition absolutely does NOT stop people using marijuana. 2.) The prohibition causes FAR more harm than what it prevents. 3.) The prohibition fuels organized crime and makes children LESS safe. It is fundamentally WRONG for the government to continue any policy that causes more harm than good! We have to put the safety of our children FIRST and demand that marijuana be legalized like beer and wine.&&&10

TAX, regulate Gamefowl sport in agri zonings&&&HISTORY LESSON ON ANIMAL RIGHTS AND TYRANNY �Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.� Hitler's Nazi Germany was marked by a preoccupation with "animal rights." Hitler's Third Reich passed numerous animal protection laws, such as declaring that shoeing a horse was cruel, and declared an end to dissection. This reduced Man�s status to that of animals, and justified treating men as animals. Before the war was ended, the Nazis stepped up experiments on the best way to castrate a Jew without anesthesia, and turned countless men, women and children into lampshades and soap. These Nazi actions were justifiable by their belief that it was possible to "...increase the moral standing of animals and decrease the moral standing of people, thus integrating human characteristics to animals... elevating animal life to the level of cult worship...which would lead to the spiritual and ideological changes necessary... for a new national identity." The real political objective of �animal rights� is to eliminate "unalienable rights," and to make way for all these other supposed rights and pervert our Bill of Rights to the point where only the perverted are protected. A favored socialist strategy is to separate the population from common sense and its own laws by bringing about chaos, clouding real issues, then bring about �change� through gradual �legislation from within.� Ruling by planned crisis is the favored method, as this short-circuits the brain�s ability to think and reason clearly about true issues. This planned chaos (such as �animal cruelty,��puppy mills� and �cock fighting�) is designed to rob the nation of its creativity and life force, degrade human existence, make everything seem uncontrollable and bad, which then allows the introduction of a tyrannical form of government. The Gestapo was first used by Goring to do away with political opponents. A "temporary" state of emergency was declared after the Reichstag fire, but was never rescinded. This allowed the Gestapo to enforce conformity at every level of society. Block wardens monitored their neighbors, and children were recruited to inform on their teachers and parents. The Gestapo was authorized to hold people in "protective custody" which was really arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. At first, only political prisoners were taken under the guise of "preventive protective custody" and placed in SS-controlled concentration camps; later, anyone was hunted down and taken who was deemed to not fit in with SS and Gestapo vision of a perfect Aryan society.("SS" came from Schutzstaffel which means "elite guard"). Today we see this same conduct and set of circumstances appearing in some of our civic institutions. The only way for one man to achieve dominion and control over another is through the darkness of IGNORANCE. Let�s get educated about our own laws, so that tyranny cannot gain a foothold in America, and so that we can once again have �happiness and good government flowing forth� as paraphrased by all our early education laws. We do have some beautiful laws. Let�s learn them, and insist that our civic institutions obey them for the good of our nation. God Bless America. -Compiled by: Janet I. Fischer and S.A.

The Immoral Inanity of Intelligent Design Creationism&&&Certainly worth the read. "Assume that, as is almost certainly true, that our universe and its contents are entirely natural in origin and nature. In that case the tragedy of the children is no one's fault. It just happened until humans built up the scientific knowledge to dramatically cut down the death of the kids to a few percent globally, less than a percent in the developed world. There is no crime because no one was in charge. But once one invokes a creator 'intelligence' that is responsible for the existence of Earth, then the planet becomes a crime scene subject to forensic investigation to determine who is guilty for the children's holocaust. A disaster that a supermind could have easily put a stop to. Keeping most kids safe is merely a matter of good nutrition, sanitation, vaccines and antibiotics. " Fundies?

TAX, regulate Gamefowl sport in agri zonings&&&Wednesday, Jun 01 2011 11:05 PM Cockfighting could earn millions for state Regarding The Californian's May 26 editorial, "Two cockfighting bills that were long overdue": On behalf of the thousands of game-bird hobbyists, I'd like to say that anyone who has been raised around game birds knows that a rooster cannot be forced or trained to fight; this is a natural instinct that was instilled by God. Animals that are forced to do what does not come naturally to them is cruel. Were horses meant to be ridden? Are the animals in the circus, zoo or rodeos meant to be used for our entertainment? When it comes to cockfighting, who are these "experts" who claim that these chickens are "trained" to fight? What real proof is there that connects drugs, gangs, prostitution and gambling to this activity? Just to go Vegas, it's all there. Raising and fighting game birds requires money: money for feed and vitamins, money for building supplies for the pens, money for items to provide their chickens the best care; WIC or EBT benefits cannot be used to purchase these items. The so-called "barbarians" who participate in this activity are working individuals who have jobs and pay taxes. If there are more than 50,000 cockfighters in California, then just imagine the money the state could produce if it was made legal and each of those 50,000 people had to purchase a yearly permit to fight: a $100 permit times 50,000 people equals $5 million or a $500 permit times 50,000 equals $25 million. Prior to being banned in Louisiana, cockfighting was a $150 million industry. MIKE HIPOLITO Shafter&&&3

Cuban Medicine Killed Hugo Chavez&&&SO WHAT! ONE TROGLODITE LESS! There is perhaps no worse political disaster for the government of Cuba than the death of President Hugo Ch�vez of Venezuela. After the Soviet Union collapsed and ceased to subsidize the Castro regime, the government of Cuba went through a very difficult period. That is, until President Ch�vez picked up the tab. While the real amount of the subsidy is unknown, Venezuela does send more than 115,000 barrelsof oil a day to the refinery at Cienfuegos and pays for tens of thousands of Cuban doctors and sports trainers who are deployed all over Latin America. The true amount is probably significantly north of five billion dollars a year. If there was anybody that could expect the very best Cuban medicine had to offer, it was the Castro's five billion dollar man. This makes the upcoming death of Ch�vez that much more embarrassing for the Castros, because the velocity at which the strongman has deteriorated is due in no small part to the incompetence of the Cuban doctors at Cimeq - the hospital of choice for the communist party leaders. According to Dr. Jose Marquina, who has become well known for having the only information on the Venezuelan president's condition that has proved over time to be accurate, the Cuban doctors are at least partially at fault for the Venezuelan leader's imminent demise. He has said that the Cubans misdiagnosed the cancer, treating Ch�vez with chemotherapy and other treatments designed for the wrong type of cancer. This made the disease resistant and impossible to treat, while causing other complications which affected not only Ch�vez's life expectancy but also the quality of what life remained. LOL!&&&17

Our feelings, good or bad, shouldn't be driving us places. They drive us down the cliff. I speak from an experienced point of view. I have lived in several countries across the globe. After all my ordeals, illicit trades, I am neither in support nor against immigration. I would however opine that societies make their immigration laws based on whether or not it is beneficial to them.

Senator Rand Paul was the pride of most of the American people when he stand up for the American people during more than 12 hours against the new drone dictator Obama who gave himself the authority to kill any American that he believes need to be killed with no trial or day in court. Undoubtedly, Obama is targeting the GOP same old losers that he use to divide the GOP and fight against the new leadership of Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Obviously, John McCain is the same old maverick and the darling of the America hating liberal media under Obama who represent the GOP RINO losers that gave Obama re-election in 2012 and potential taking over the House in 2014 elections. The spineless John McCain that Obama likes to invite to rich dinners is stabbing the GOP in the back and the American people as well refusing to stand up to Obama while he dares fighting the true great GOP Senators such as the great Rand Paul and Ted Cruz who represent the new GOP that will defeat Obama. John McCain fighting against his own GOP new party leadership and new generation is chutzpah and is despicable and it shows his effort to be hugged by the anti-American socialistic of the NY Times. If the GOP new leaders will not shut up John McCain they could lose the election of 2014.&&&2

Becomming A Nudist Family&&&I am a 34 year old single mother with three beautiful children.My twin son and daughter are fourteen,and my youngest daughter is twelve. Last year I had a life changing experience.A co worker of mine told me that she and her family are nudists.Not only are they members of a nearby family oriented nudist resort,but they also seldom wear clothes at home.She told me just how much her family and her love the nudist lifestyle and of the benefits that go along with Being nudists,and even invited my family and I to be their guests at their resort. My friend left the company before I could take her up on her invitation and we have lost contact.But her being a nudist did plant the seed of curiosity in me,so last summer on a weekend,when my kids spent the weekend with their grandparents,I visited a nudist resort/hotel in Palm Springs alone.It took a lot of courage for me to bare it all in the presence of total strangers,but once I did my fears totally disappeared.I absolutely loved the experience.Being nude outdoors made me feel so free and natural.It was a wholesome feeling of freedom that unless you've experienced is impossible to describe.The only way I can describe this feeling is i;t like a new born baby entering the world for the very first time.I absolutely fell in love with the nudist lifestyle. I visited the resort two more times last year and when the kids aren't home I often go nude around the house.Over the last several months I've become more and more convinced this is the way I want to live. My problem is I have become a closet nudist.So far I haven't been able to tell my kids that their mother is a nudist.I shouldn't be afraid because there is nothing dirty or shameful about casual nudity,or the nudist lifestyle in general. Now that the warm weather will be here soon,I plan on telling them in the near future.and hopefully they will want to participate in home nudism with me,and eventually visit a nudist resort as a family.I will of course understand If they don't want to participate in nudist activities but hopefully they will be tolerant of their mom going nude at home. I think it would be easier if my kids were younger.but all three are teenagers,and are going through puberty and and I just don't know how to approach them on the idea of family nudism.Have any other parents had this dilemma?&&&14

ALERT: NY Women Must Sacrifice Their "Real Estate" To Corrupt Judge Drager God!&&&NY's Women Work A Lifetime, To Have Assets Seized Unlawfully By Judge Drager It is a right of passage, when Judge Drager is your Judge at your Divorce. You must put up your "real estate" as a sacrifice to the Drager god. Judge Drager has to pay her bills! Paying off lawyers, public relations experts to submerge negative text is an expensive proposition. This corrupt Judge has quite a network in place to steal a woman's assets. The process is as follows: 1. Judge Drager throws negative stories in the press about an accomplished woman to destroy her credibility. 2. Judge Drager buys or threatens your attorney to work against you, and then when you have a problem with it she throws more negative information in the Press to show that you are difficult to deal with. 3. Judge Drager puts a "gag order" on your case, so you can't defend yourself. This "gag order" is based on all of the negative press, Judge Drager Puts Out there. 4. Judge Drager attacks your children, so the women has to focus on something else, while she steals your assets. 5 Judge Drager steals your multi-million dollar piece of real estate and devours it.

Even though our fine legislators and the governors home base is Charleston they send all our monies to Morgantown. The heck with Kanawha Valley and its residents! Morgantown rules the roost and if lucky everyone else will be compelled to accept the leftovers with humility and grace. Thank you WVU for being so very gracious and generous. How in this world will we in the Kanawha Valley and other parts of the state ever be able to repay you. Indebted to WVU we truly are.&&&5

Priest takes center stage in controversy&&&I was a parishioner in Our Lady of Lourdes more than 10 years ago. Father Mason was Pastor then and I can honestly tell you that I NEVER walked out of mass feeling hopefull or feeling the power of God's love. Every homily was on premarital sex, abortiion & condoms. I walked out of the Mother's Day mass with my new born son because I was celebrating my first Mother's Day and did not want to hear about abortion on that day. I would also like to state that when there is a "Childrens mass" being served, the homily should not reflect upon such things. I do not want to explain to my young child when he asks "Mommy, What is a condom?" During that time in my life, my husband & I taught pre cana. Father Lisante was the directing priest. He was wonderful, insightful & refreshing. He was full of love, hope & encouragement for the engaged couples. Father Mason drove all of the young families out of that parish. I myself went to a neighboring parish for the rest of the time I lived there. Hats off to Father Lisante who will definately have an uphill battle winning that parish over and the cult following Father Mason created there.&&&200

Darrell Issa: Setting priorities for immigration reform&&&Since 80 to 90% of illegal immigration involves our 4 southern neighboring countries in North America, a solution MUST absolutely involve their interests as well as that of the US. All countries in North America (Canada, US, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama) should be working towards lowering free trade barriers, allowing free movement of all citizens in North America, and more economic integration. All these things are naturally happening, but US immigration laws are a MASSIVE barrier due to special interests or racism. Spending $18,000,000,000 dollars a year to find, arrest, take to trial, then deport our neighbors doesn't make any sense for anyone. Lower taxes and allow free movement of people in the North America zone!&&&17

Stewart Talks Voting Rights Act, Supreme Court&&&Instead of the voting rights act, I think we need more educated voters to begin with! Many vote, and don't even know what the candidate really stands for. " Excerpts: At first everyone thought it was a joke. But it wasn't. In the March 18 Illinois primary, two zombified followers of right-wing extremist Lyndon LaRouche actually won the Democratic nominations for secretary of state and lieutenant governor. Janice Hart and Mark Fairchild won on the platform articulated in their cult's New Solidarity newspaper: eliminate Gramm-Rudman, fund Star Wars, test everyone for AIDS (and quarantine victims), and form a "Nuremberg Tribunal" to investigate drug dealing by Zionists and journalists, represented by Henry Kissinger and Katherine Graham, whom the LaRouchies want to hang for treason. Although Hart and Fairchild articulated their sick program to anyone who would listen, most of those who voted for them had no idea what they stood for. THE 1986 ILLINOIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY On March 18, 1986, the State of Illinois held its primary elections in preparation for the November state-wide general election. Stunning the state and national Democratic parties, two followers of Lyndon LaRouche won nomination for the state's second and third highest offices. LaRouche candidate Mark J. Fairchild defeated party regular George E. Sangmeister (a state senator, later a U.S. congressman, from Mokena) for lieutenant governor and LaRouche candidate Janice Hart defeated party regular Aurelia Pucinski, a Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District Board member and daughter of a powerful Chicago city alderman and Democratic committeeman, for Secretary of State. The results were nothing less than a stunning upset, creating chaos within the state Democratic party. The LaRouchites espouse a bizarre philosophy that includes racism, passionate support for nuclear power, and accusations against public figures: Walter Mondale and FBI director William H. Webster are described as "Soviet agents of influence," the Queen of England as "a kingpin of the global drug traffic." The central fact is that for most Illinois voters -- and for Democrats in particular -- the primary election was a total bore and waste of time. They didn't pay attention because they didn't think it made any difference -- and everything in recent experience suggests they were absolutely right. "&&&1
Climate Change: Congress Warned About 'High Risk' Posed By Global Shifts&&&WASHINGTON -- The federal government's official watchdog had a message for Congress on Thursday: Hey, Stupid, the climate is changing. The Government Accountability Office delivered that warning in its update of the greatest threats the government faces in carrying out federal programs. Generally the GAO identifies things like flaws in the defense contracting process and fraud in health care programs. This year's update of the High-Risk Series report included the increasingly obvious and growing external threat of climate change -- in spite of the continued insistence from many members of Congress that fears over global warming are overblown. "Limiting the federal government's fiscal exposure to climate change is one of the new areas we have on the list," Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, the head of the GAO, told reporters at a Capitol Hill press conference. "The federal government is terribly exposed to this change," he added, noting that the government owns hundreds of thousands of buildings, operates defense installations, picks up the tab to help local governments with disasters, and runs crop and flood insurance programs. "The government doesn't budget for disaster," Dodaro said, "and the record number of disasters hit above 90 in 2012." Dodaro was aware that some in Congress might not like his agency's embrace of climate change, but he argued that the facts justified it. "We believe that the information coming from the National Academy of Sciences and from the federal government's own global change research program ... has been very clear on the science underpinning this area," Dodaro said. He did allow that the GAO was staying away from the debate on why the climate is changing. "We are not focusing on what's causing these changes. We know that there are efforts under way to deal with emission issues, so that's a policy matter for the Congress," he said. "We think there's enough scientific evidence to show, regardless of whether anything else changes, there's enough problems identified." Still, while President Barack Obama has proposed making a stronger push to deal with climate change, and leaders in the Senate have praised him for it, the idea has received a chilly reception from leaders in the House. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, joined Dodaro at the press conference to emphasize that it doesn't matter whether lawmakers agree on climate change, the effects are nonetheless occurring, and Congress should plan. "We're recognizing that we have under-appropriated and under-prepared for a wide variety of disasters," Issa said. "If they're occurring more, not less, if we're seeing an absence of indexing for inflation, those are all areas that legitimately put it at high risk," Issa added, even while indicating he has some skepticism on the climate front. "I hope all members of Congress on both sides of the issue recognize that it's really not about where you are on climate change, how much CO2 is being emitted -- which, by the way, has gone down, not up -- it's really about recognizing that Congress has not adjusted for the amount of money we are paying out," Issa said. The cost issue was one of the prime factors Dodaro cited in deciding to take the potential political risk of officially elevating the threat. "We also believe the timing is right because of the federal government's fiscal position," Dodaro said. "We can no longer afford to take on these huge costs that occur as a result of disasters, and we need to prepare properly. We think we have a sound case." Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, had the starkest warning for his colleagues. "This landmark action by the nonpartisan experts at GAO ... is a wake-up call for Congress to finally start addressing this issue," Cummings said Thursday.&&&2

Capitol Alert: AM Alert: Immigration bus tour starts rolling through California&&&PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION AGAINST AN AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS!

While every petition, fax, email and phone call against the amnesty is important, signing this petition is by far the most important single thing one of your friends or relatives can do. The reason is that signing this petition puts a person into an email system at NumbersUSA that will alert them every time one of their elected officials needs to hear something specific about immigration. Nobody else but NumbersUSA runs a customized grassroots mobilization system like this that constantly gathers information on Capitol Hill about your Members of Congress and then lets you know what they are doing, saying and thinking about immigration policy. The New York Times and other mass media have repeatedly stated that NumbersUSA's mobilization network led the efforts that defeated the close-call amnesty efforts of 2007 and 2010. But the forces for open borders are far more powerful today. Please help by passing along this Petition to everybody you know.&&&1

Bill to help clarify Ohio licenses for immigrants&&&"Since the program was announced in June, states have grappled with how and whether to issue driver's licenses to those granted legal presence." They have not been granted legal status, if they were they would be issued greencards. No one but congress can make anyone legal or a citizen. What Obama has done is against federal law by not deporting these illegal aliens.&&&1

Sequester frustrating Ohioans&&&Leon Harrison Clayton, Ohio Saturday, March 2, 2013 To: The Editor Subject: Tired of being threatened and pestered �Tired of being threatened and pestered� Most of we the people are tired of being threatened and pestered, especially by people who legally rob us with government jobs, about this insignificant (to us) 2.3 percent federal budget-increase-cut sequester. We can start, at places like the bases, by firing all of these chiefs of installation protocol, and diversity and sensitivity advisors, contractors, consultants, teachers and trainers. Of course, we can likewise advise these single mothers and others to get their alimony and child support; or, like ya know, tell their sad stories on the Doctor Phil, Maury Povich and Jerry Springer TV shows. As an old Cold Warrior, I have had more than my fair share of Pentagon pork, not that I ever faced or fired a hostile shot. In addition to this dreadful defense-contractor, patriotic Pentagon-PAC-rat, and military-media budget-sequester hysteria, we the people have heard and learned that we apparently have an extra $60 million to send to Syria.

Tax hike for wealthy won't kill growth: CBO&&&The GOP is simply going to have to come to terms with the reality that they lost their bid for the Presidency and with it the reins of the executive branch of the federal government. Their agenda is effectively decapitated. This does not leave them powerless, but they are not calling the shots. Get used to it.&&&666
Sequestration affects tornado relief efforts in Adairsville&&&But, of course, it will! Do you REALLY think Obama gives a rat's as* how or if we clean up Adairsville? Why do you think we did not qualify for FEMA assistance after a F3 tornado blew through here? The answer is simple. Election Day 2012. Mitt Romney carried GA. Obama didn't stand a chance here and he knows it. This is a "payback" because that is exactly the type of "man" our President is. A spiteful, mean, vindictive, biased, arrogant, narcissistic ego maniac. Well, I have some news for him: Adairsville GA ain't New Orleans, LA. We are pulling out of this disaster just fine without the government's effing help. Our families, friends, neighbors (from Adairsville and the surrounding communities like Kennesaw, Marietta, Rome, Cartersville and many other "sister" cities) have stepped up, helped us brush ourselves off and stood beside us the entire way. The clean up effort has been phenomenal. A huge thank you to all of you who have had our backs during this trying time. And a huge "Thanks for nothing" to Obama.&&&1

How the Democrats Destroyed Detroit&&&Detroit & Chicago are text book case examples of cities run by just one party kept in power with corrupt unions and citizens begging for more handouts. The citizens of these two cities have been voting lock step with democrats who have bettered them self and unions at the expense of the voter/tax payers. But the bill for all of these greedy excessively expensive union contracts is going to come due soon and neither city has the funds to support those bloated retirement promises made to unions in exchange for union support. So which city will be in bankruptcy court first?? There isn't enough money in either the city or state treasury to support these two bloated fiscal messes.&&&10
