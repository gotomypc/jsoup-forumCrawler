Isle housing bottom seen - Business&&&"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that we may be close to a bottom," said Harvey Shapiro, research economist for the Honolulu Board of Realtors. Give me a break, who can afford to buy??? not the average family in Hawaii only the rich and out of town folks.

HI worst state to make a living&&&According to the following recent article: - While Hawaii's natural beauty appeals to many, it hasn't necessarily helped its employment landscape: The state has earned the distinction of worst state for making a living in all three years of this study. The chief culprit is the highest cost of living of any state, and a relatively high state tax burden compounds the problem. Hawaiians do like their workplaces -- the state ranked first in the poll on workplace environment -- but economic factors still make this the toughest place for making a living.&&&8

He is said to have killed at least 20 women in the 1930s. His existence was long believed to be apocryphal, but he is a familiar figure in Texas folklore. .

20 Minute Evictions in Hawai?&&&Here it is. Just got back from Vegas after working in the casinos for 23 years.

Sold my house back in Nevada and have enough to buy my own house here. Can't stand all the noise at the relatives with all the kids from other family members living there. Searching to buy a house but don't want to eat up my savings on hotels while I look around to buy. Gotta rent for a while but my friends are warning me about the 20 minute eviction scams on the island. Anyone have any feedback on that? Don't want to get ripped.&&&11

Africans in Africa&&&I want my people to wake up... The other day I was talking with an African guy from Kenya, who's never been to America until recently. And he was telling me about what they were teaching inside of his African text books. He said they taught about slavery and very briefly did they go over what happened to the slaves after they were taken away from Africa. He said, he didn't know that Black people in Americans were actually from Africa because the text books never really went over it! He said that he wasn't even aware of all the things that had happened to Africans outside of Africa when they were sold until he came here to America and learned about it! Isn't it scary how the mains sources we rely on for knowledge (such as our school history books) could be cutting out an entire part of our Black history!?? I mean, it seems we know a lot about what went on with us here in America (400 years of slavery, and also fighting for civil rights). But my question is, how did we live in Africa BEFORE the Europeans came and took it over. I'm talking about the time after Egypt and BEFORE the 1500s AD when the Europeans started forcing their trade over in Africa. Isn't anyone else curious about this?? Don't you think this part in our history is pretty significant if we want to move forward as a people!?&&&4

Micronesians-generalized&&&Micronesian-In hawaii its a term used by so many to generalize a very small portion of an entire sub-region thats as large as the continental United States. "Micronesian"-unfort unately, when the term is used it usually refers to a negative event. I am micronesian, Yapese straight and true, it saddens me when I sit here in and read about all the negativity brought upon an entire region because most of us today don't care to educate ourselves any better. Now Micronesians-is not a race, its a term that refers to the inhabitants that live in the sub-region part of the pacific known as micronesia. Each Island comes with its very own unique language,customs, and traditions. I am proud of my Island, and its traditions. In fact its one of the last islands in the micronesian region that still retains its traditions and customs in a time and age when everyone wants the coolest gadget in town. It is also the Island that brought traditional navigation by means of the stars back to hawaii-and the rest of the pacific world. An art nearly lost in the annals of time. However more-ever than not We find ourselves victims of unfair generalization. While its unfair, I will not however sit here and tell you I endorse the crimes and mischief done by "micronesians". In fact most Micronesian come the states in search of a better life.Some however, I cannot tell you why they even waste the money on that plane ticket. Chuuk, would you argue that most of the "micronesian" crimes in Guam and Hawaii come from these people? In all fairness I have met some great people from chuuk,Very intellegent,very outgoing people.To understand why so many crimes are associated to this one island you must understand the people at thier origin.Where they came from. chuuk is poverty ridden and the gap between the rich and poor is about the entire length of micronesia east to west. Its the simple fact of state-national government failing to educate its people. So while a select few come to the states looking for a better life. so many come with no vision in mind, not an inkling of what to do once in hawaii other than how to get to hawaii and than BLING BLING; post up on the blocks, Go walking around malls talking up a storm like the person your talking to walking next to you is a mile away.good riddance. I put off going to UH after I lost a family member to the war, Two deployments later, I sit here in disgust on what certain groups is doing to the name Micronesia. Its to the point now that if you ask someone from the region where are you from? Micronesia is the last answer you'll hear. I understand the frustration, sometimes I wonder just what the hell, load this HK walk out find these wannabe chuukes gangsters and show them just what war is. I honestly do feel that way at times,but its not the right thing to do, and instead of proving a point-I had just made myself one of them.When the six'oclock news comes on it won't say-"man shoots group"-it'll say "micronesian opens fire on other micronesians" or "more micronesian violence." I just turned into a hypocrit. I only hope these people understand what they are doing to the image of an entire region. Someday,Sometime, when the compact of free association ends, and everyone gets shipped back to the islands-then maybe they'll learn that pimp'n contrary to what you see in all the gangster movies gets you NOWHERE. aloha-mogethin.

Civil Unions - Honolulu, HI&&&The Civil Union/Same Sex Marriage debate is a distraction away from important issues facing this country today. Let the states decide whether same sex marriage is right for them and let's move on. Google the NDAA and SOPA acts -just do it and see what comes up. Let's focus on real issues like the importance of the next election, the imploding economy and dollar, and the war being pushed with Iran that will no doubt lead to WWIII. Remember, when a mainstream media host says there are no such things as conspiracies -that in itself is a conspiratorial statement. Never mind the fact they don't like losing their audiences to truth based reporting from non mainstream news sources. Once you have a taste of truthful reporting you never go back to mainstream contrived corporate media. These hosts bash Republicans and Democrats equally because they know both sides are illuminati bought puppets out to screw us. Give alternative news sources a chance before you knock them. Download these shows to your MP3 players and listen on your way to work or whatever. All you need from mainstream media is breaking news and traffic/weather. Exposes US Gov Corruption and Global Wide Illuminati Plots #(Skip around, you'll learn something useful) Exposes Wallstreet and absolutely teaches you how to protect your money from the banksters Exposes Secret/Ancient Knowledge Suppressed In Modern History Books and suppressed medical cures/prevention for diseaseses like cancer, etc. This guy is a medical doctor. Often Exposes NASA Disinformation and Possible Offworld Intelligence Coverups (10PM to 2am) Coast To Coast Free Archives Connects Bible Predictions/Prophecy to Modern Day Events -How Illuminati uses bible prophecy to plan false flag disasters eg. earthquakes, etc. For a summary of all the topics discussed on these broadcasts this is my take on it These radio hosts should do a show together or at least make guest appearences on each others shows. They all value truth and liberty in their own way. With that SOPA legislation now passed we don't have a lot of time left to get informed before the net is censored. Vote Ron Paul 2012&&&45

Memories of old Honolulu are still sweet&&&Wow, thanks for the memories. We grew up near the Kapalama Canal, a housing right next to the City incinerator. We would walk to Aala park to sell newspepa and bum around. We use to sit on the King Street Bridge and ask sailors to " Toss a coin, Sir." we dive into Nuuanu stream for nickels ,yuk. My friend Clifford Miller use to live in the Green block. His father was a Filipino Taylor that had a shop on Beretania mauka, between Maunakea and Smith. This was in 1955-62. We attended Kaiulani School near Palama theater. Hotel Street was buzzing during all hours. Police, MPs, sailors locals,Chinese Wow your right, this was Shangrala. Aloha, my friend..&&&3

Yo SHLT 4 Brains i was on tv .......&&&Just got back from the LA LAKER'S LOSING another one. The pencil necked pointed chrome domed black mamba's boy showed up in the second half and that was when the Lakers really started to stink it up. You would think that a team that shoots that bad would practice trying to throw the ball in the ocean. The Staple Center idn't that far from the beach. Fight some smog and traffic on a bumpy @ss road, maybe a helicopter following a car chase and Wa La you are at the beach. I mean who wouldn't enjoy body surfing those mocha colored waves. My ears are still clanging from the ball bouncing off the metal rim. My neighbors saw me on tv. Did you Sh!t 4 Brains? I was yelling your name and flipping you off. Maybe it will make it to local Backstage Lakers tv show. So scan the dilm and worry. You can tell that you are too old to be a true fan because the Real Laker Fans start leaving early and quietly when they get beat down, like tonight.

Fighting Lani Slumlord Properties&&&How Slumlords Neglect Affects Tenants Many tenants put up with substandard living conditions because they simply do not have the money to move. However, there are ways for tenants to fight slumlords. By definition, a slumlord is a landlord who tries to maximize profits by spending the minimal amount of money on property maintenance. Often, slumlords own properties in poor neighborhoods and charge low rent to tenants as a "deal" to lure in tenants who cannot pay high rent or who cannot pass a credit or background check. Slumlords are sometimes the reason behind declining property values in entire neighborhoods and are generally depicted as greedy people who make a living off poor people's money with little regard to their state of living. Examples of Landlord Neglect Some examples of landlord neglect may include: Leaky roof Leaky toilet, or toilet that does not flush properly Clogged drains in bathtub Damp and/or moldy walls Cracked or broken steps or driveways Missing screens from windows Non-functioning garbage disposal Cracked ceilings Peeling paint No hot water No working heating system Floors or walls in poor condition Vermin or insect infestations Lack of proper outdoor lighting Other code violations In addition, when total neglect is occurring on a property, the maintenance personnel may rarely appear when called, the rent may be raised for no particular reason, and security deposits are rarely returned. Fighting the Slumlords If a landlord fails to make required repairs or standard maintenance, a tenant should do the following: Contact a local government agency. In the front of the phone book, there are often listings such as "Fair Housing Authority," "Housing Authority/Rental Assistance," or the "Housing and Community Services Department." These agencies have information on fair housing practices and will lead the tenant through the proper channels to report a claim. If there is a vermin infestation or mold problems, contact the city or county Health Department. Use the "repair and deduct" law. Some jurisdictions allow a tenant to give written notice to the landlord regarding a defect in the property. The notice should give the landlord a set amount of time to make the repair. If the allotted time passes with no repair, the tenant may hire a professional, paid out of their own pocket, and then deduct the costs from their rent. Tenants should be aware of cost restrictions in their state. The implied warranty of habitability. In some states, there is a law that implies that by leasing a residential property, the landlord is promising that it is suitable to live in and will remain in proper condition. Under this law, if the landlord fails to make repairs, the tenant may simply stop paying rent. If the tenant is sued, they can invoke the implied warranty. This can be tricky, however, and should be used with caution and only if the law exists in the tenant's home state.&&&52

Water Ways: Thanks for all of your hard work&&&I may be a bit off topic , I learned to sail at the Keehi Lagoon yacht club. It was a Navy operation, and back in 1969 I learned about their "learn how to sail" program from a billboard in the submarine barracks. Old wood boats with a "dipping lug" rig. Suffice to say that if you can tack this 14 foot boat by yourself you can sail anything. The instructors (volunteers) were correct. I suppose the wind gusts coming down from the passes in the Ko'olau mountains still huff and puff , but the waters where I learned the beauty of sail are now under the concrete of the reef runway at Honolulu International.&&&3

This would apply to people like De'Marquise Elkins, Adam Lanza (had he lived), Khalid Sheik Mohammad, Osama Bin Laden, Ted Kaczynski, Jeffery Dahmer, as well as leaders of gangs who continue violent gang activity in prison spilling out into free society (like the slaying of the Colorado Prison warden).&&&7

Demonstrators camp out at city hall&&&Copy: The Occupy Cult Occupy Honolulu - having co-opted from de]Occupy Honolulu - Kanawai Mamalahoe "The Law of the Splintered Paddle," a ruling passed by Kamehameha the Great and incorporated into the Hawaii State Constitution - from the above mentioned Hawaiian rights group as well as its banner / flag as a front (of which the leadership of Occupy Honolulu considers as being really nothing more than a bunch of "lame Hawaiians") and as is now openly mocked by the Occupy Honolulu (Hui!) and with this now sick, hypocritical joke / sham of a local Island movement having become nothing more than a denigrated fraud and as having lost much of its original support - while 'trying' to change / correct present civil policy as may apply to the disadvantaged with virtually frivolous law-suits, all the while - more than just a few of the mostly vagrant community of this roadside hovel are breaking the law themselves and violating the rights of others inclusive of the disabled - with what has become for the most part a criminal, pot - and meth head, riff-raff, drug-junkie, alcohol addicted, chronically lost, illegal's, cons, pathetic losers, communist kooks, assorted psychos, freaks and haven for perpetual A.-holes. They've also presently created, not only for themselves but [especially] passing motorists and pedestrians - extremely hazardous conditions and have taken a section of the park with the result of the area being turned into nothing but muddy-dirt and rubbish, their garbage and laundry draped over hedges, walls and benches - all being made even more unsightly with overstuffed furniture, the stench of feces and urine --- contrived into making the place no longer suitable for the average tax paying park goer. Without their preferred "approach / cause," and as in this particular [Occupy] instance, with it being no longer as possessing any real validity and meaning,- and as concerns these so-called petitioning (read as fanatical) "leaders" - people that actually represent what's systemically wrong with this country, these nobodies; the stupidly arrogant, incredulous and loud mouthed flake, Christopher (Butt Licker) Nova smith needs a "wake-up" slap and a solid punch in his ugly face - while with that self entitled douche-bag, Ms Catherine (The Privileged) "Vinegar" Russell deserving nothing more than a swift kick in her fat head, a straight jacket and being sent directly back to whatever filthy crap hole she just so happened to have crawled out of. They brag about this Occupy event being the longest running anywhere, and yes the rights of those most affected (living on the streets) need be addressed, however this - now being again, for the most part a cover for illicit activity only still exists, one would have to guess, due to (unlike similar past events on Wall Street and even around the world,) Hawaii's fairly mild weather as being a major contributor to this so-called "protests" longevity. --Ridiculous louts.

Is Lani Properties a Scam Business?&&&I was going to rent a place, when a neighbor who lived nearby in the area warned me of the probable shady reputation of this property management company. I've searched some consumer reports sites and looked up some public records and read some things, but has anyone on topix dealt with this company? I'de hate to sign a lease and get burned some how. Does anyone know of anyone who has done business with these people? Any feedback good or bad would be appreciated.&&&162

jesus is sun god&&&Blood on Our Hands Ezekiel 33:7-9 Written by Gary Ladd Thursday, 25 March 2010 17:07 The very title of this message contains a terribly frightening prospect for a minister of the gospel:Blood on Our Hands. It contains the kind of implication from which, if we followed our instinct, we would tuck our tails and run:Blood on Our Hands. Serious thought of the possibility of such a reality is almost enough to overwhelm even the strongest of us Blood on Our Hands. Out of the imagery of the Old Testament comes the idea for the message. All major cities in the Old Testament world had a watchman stationed atop a tall tower on the wall, where a maximum range of visibility would be his. If an enemy army approached the city, the watchmans duty was to warn the city of an impending attack. If the watchman failed in his duty of warning, and the city was overrun and its citizenry massacred, the watchman would be held responsible. The blood of those who had perished would be on his hands. With this symbolism in mind, God said to the prophet Ezekiel Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel ... When I say to the wicked,O wicked man, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. But if you on your part warn a wicked man ... you have delivered your life(Ezek. 33:79 NASB). I. The relevance of blood on our hands. Because of the location of the text and the seriousness of its inference, the tendency today is to lay the issue of blood on our hands on a man-made shelf of Old Testament irrelevancy. With the attitude of what happened before Christ came does not pertain to us, much of contemporary Christianity would reject this principle as outmoded a thing of the past. This may be a legitimate claim except for the fact that the apostle Paul, inspired by the Holy Spirit, contends that the principle of bloodguilt for negligence is still binding in this Christian age. When he left the city of Ephesus, he boldly stated, I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God(Acts 20:26, 27 KJV). The apostle might have left the city of Ephesus with blood on his hands. But rather, I am not guilty of blood in Ephesus, he cries. My hands are clean. According to the New Testament, a failure to discharge a God-given responsibility to speak out means the blood of eternal souls is on our hands. The bloodguilt principle found in the Old Testament is repeated in the New Testament. Its recurrence enforces its ratification in your life and mine. II. The reality of blood on our hands. Relevance suggests reality, and there is no more frightening reality in the life of any Christian than the reality of being held responsible for the souls of others. That we, by our negligence, can be guilty of a kind of spiritual homicide that our hands can be stained with blood because of indifference toward those who are lost what an awesome truth! The reality of blood on our hands rebukes anything short of total commitment to the task of sharing the exciting news of Jesus. The reality of bloodguilt is a reproof to anything short of a life controlled by the Holy Spirit, being in the right place at the right time, playing a part in Gods redemptive activity. The reality of bloodguilt is a censure on careless living, sin-obstructed testimonies, and Spirit-grieving habits. It is a constant rebuttal to the kind of cowering fear that causes Christians to shut up when they ought to speak up. Here is some relief and good news for you today the heart of this message has to do with how the blood may be removed. III. The removal of blood on our hands. Blood on our hands is a frightening reality. But the blood can be removed. Every preacher of the gospel should seriously consider how. A. First, blood can be removed by the cultiv&&&1

Marijuana - Honolulu, HI&&&It's ludicrous to continue the illegality of marijuana. It is not addictive and no one has ever died of an overdose. Unlike alcohol, which is one of the most addictive of drugs and is involved in thousands of deaths a year. Yet the old men who make our laws continue to attack marijuana use, while sipping on their scotch. I'm not a marijuana user myself, but I see no reason not to allow those who are users do so without the threat of prosecution. There are so many more arguments to made in favor of legalization, but I'll leave those for others to make.&&&124

Walgreens seeks to open store in Nanakuli - Business&&&"Nanakuli resident Hanalei Aipoalani, who is the secretary-treasurer for the Nanakuli-Maili Neighborhood Board, said having a nationally branded company like Walgreens in the neighborhood would not only create much-needed jobs, but stimulate the economy, help to ease traffic congestion and increase the time area residents spend with their families." SAY WHAT? COME AGAIN? The only jobs it will create are minimum wage, benefitless, with the bulk of them being only part time to avoid having to fork over for medical. And someone please tell me how this will allow people to spend more time with their families? Has someone identified the break down of the family unit being caused by people spending too much time traveling to stores? Catch Hanalei on a day when she isn't bogarting the pipe. She will read what she said and crack up laughing. Walgreen on the mainland is a joke and I can't imagine it being any different in Hawaii. On a positive note, this will be a bonanza for the security guard companies. Build it in Nanakuli and you'll need one at the register, one or two outside, and one in each aisle to maintain order and control shoplifting. As the economy disintegrates, this will be the first project pulled from Walgreen's master plan for Hawaii.&&&50

Jesus is Nimrod, Christians are Devil worshippers&&&Christians are Devil worshippers. In those ancient times, there was a man named Nimrod, who was the grandson of one of Noah's son named Ham. Ham had a son named Cush who married a woman named Semiramis.Cush and Semiramis then had a son named him "Nimrod." After the death of his father, Nimrod married his own mother and became a powerful King. The Bible tells of of this man, Nimrod, in Genesis 10:8-10 as follows: "And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad,and Calneh, in the land of Shinar." Nimrod became a god-man to the people and Semiramis, his wife and mother, became the powerful Queen of ancient Babylon. Nimrod was eventually killed by an enemy, and his body was cut in pieces and sent to various parts of his kingdom. Semiramis had all of the parts gathered, except for one part that could not be found. That missing part was his reproductive organ. Semiramis claimed that Nimrod could not come back to life without it and told the people of Babylon that Nimrod had ascended to the sun and was now to be called "Baal", the sun god.&&&19
Cheney Admits He Lied About 9/11&&&Cheney Admits that He Lied about 9/11 What Else Did He Lie About? The New York Times Maureen Daud writes today: In a documentary soon to appear on Showtime, The World According to Dick Cheney,[Cheney said]I got on the telephone with the president, who was in Florida, and told him not to be at one location where we could both be taken out. Mr. Cheney kept W. flying aimlessly in the air on 9/11 while he and Lynn left on a helicopter for a secure undisclosed location, leaving Washington in a bleak, scared silence, with no one reassuring the nation in those first terrifying hours. I gave the instructions that wed authorize our pilots to take it out,' he says, referring to the jet headed to Washington that crashed in a Pennsylvania field. He adds:After Id given the order, it was pretty quiet. Everybody had heard it, and it was obviously a significant moment. *** When they testified together before the 9/11 Commission, W. and Mr. Cheney kept up a pretense that in a previous call, the president had authorized the vice president to give a shoot-down order if needed. But the commission found no documentary evidence for this call. In other words, Cheney pretended that Bush had authorized a shoot-down order, but Cheney now admits that he never did. In fact, Cheney acted as if he was the president on 9/11. Cheney lied about numerous other facts related to 9/11 as well. For example, Cheney: Falsely linked Iraq with 9/11 (indeed, the entire torture program was aimed at establishing such a false linkage; and Cheney is the guy who pushed for torture, pressured the Justice Department lawyers to write memos saying torture was legal, and made the pitch to Congress justifying torture. the former director of the CIA said Cheney of overseeing American torture policies) Falsely claimed that spying on Americans, torture, the Patriot Act, the Afghanistan war, the Iraq war and the war on terror were all necessitated by 9/11  when all of them started or were planned before 9/11 Falsely stated that an attack such as 9/11 was unforeseeable, when Al Qaeda flying planes into the World Trade Center and Pentagon was something which American military and intelligence services  and our allies  knew could happen Falsely pretended that he was out of the loop during the 9/11 attacks Falsely blamed others for 9/11, when Cheney was in charge of all of Americas counter-terrorism exercises, activities and responses on 9/11. See this Department of State announcement and this CNN article   And when Cheney was apparently responsible for letting the Pentagon get hit by an airplane (confirmed here and here) And was instrumental in squashing a real investigation into 9/11&&&22

The rest of the batters are doing the same thing without any corrections. 2. SMALL BALL - Unsuccessful because the UH BATTERS cannot execute the bunts. NO hit and run. Not enough steals. 3. PITCHING - COSTA pitched 104 pitches in his last outing and that is too many pitches for a young pitcher. Maybe he will develop a sore arm like JARRET ARAKAWA if he is kept in the game too long. RUNNING OF THE BASES - UH RUNNERS are looking at the ball because the base coaches are non existent. TRAPASSO MUST GIVE THE ASSISTANT COACHES THE AUTHORITY TO DO THEIR RESPECTIVE JOBS.&&&1

Does Tulsi Gabbard Prefer Black Guys?&&&Tulsi Gabbard does not apparently have time to respond to serious questions from her constituents, but does have time to respond to some guy on Twitter declaring his love. From the fellow's message, which was simply "I love you," and from his avatar, showing someone giving the finger to someone else, I am frankly a little surprised that this is what Tulsi found the time to respond to. I am sure I am not the only person who saw it, and wondered what this was about. I figured the person, who calls himself "Negus Nixon," and uses the Twitter ID "ABlackMiguel," must be involved in politics perhaps. So I had a look at his Twitter feed to find out. What I found there was rather shocking, to put it mildly. First, it would appear that he sent his message off to Tulsi in the middle of about 50 tweets about a football game. Second, the tweet right after his declaration of love was just one word, with four letters, and starting with an "F." And "No," there were not a bunch of tweets like this. There was just the one. I had a quick look down the page at some of the previous tweets, and most of them had swearing and sexual content. For example, one says, "What a dumb f**ker." Once you get past all the football tweets, there is another which says, "Hittin the vag from the left is my changed preference." There are also a few on the topic of female "squirting." Last, but not least, there is "Old white women love me." It is also interesting to see what the fellow had enough confidence to say right after being worthy of a reply from the famous Tulsi Gabbard. The one which definitely caught my eye was "It aint nothing wrong with a little domestic violence." Now I'm guessing the reader is thinking this is just too crazy to be true. Actually, you can see all of this on the fellow's Twitter page which I mentioned above. You will have to scroll down to Dec 1st to see the reply from Tulsi, and the other tweets I have mentioned. The exchange can also be seen on Tulsi's Twitter feed. Tulsi's reply was "Aloha!" which I don't really have a problem with. I also don't really care if she prefers black guys. What does disturb me is that she is not responding to her constituents, but she is responding to some guy whose avatar is giving the finger, and who is tweeting about "hitting the vag from the left," and female "squirting," and God knows what else in his previous 10,000 tweets. I have written previously that Tulsi is a representative of others. This means that her supporters, those associated with her, and those she represents, all automatically become associated with what she says and does. Unless they say otherwise, it can be assumed that they support what she is doing. So I am just going to say that I don't think this particular response is something that Hawaiins would support, or Hindus, or Veterans, or too many other people. In other words, I don't think that Tulsi is acting as a very good representative of any of these people. I also want to clearly state that I don't personally support Tulsi's action. I have previously taken her to task about her lack of responsiveness, but that is to serious questions. She gets so many messages, on Facebook alone, from people saying they like her or whatever. No one even really expects a response to these. I am just really surprised that she has chosen to respond to someone posting public messages like the ones I mentioned, and that this is what she has chosen to associate herself with. Finally, I have to add that I have no problem whatsoever with the fellow posting whatever he pleases. It's a free country, and he is not a representative of anyone, except himself. Tulsi, however, is certainly an official representative of many people, and I do not believe those she represents would approve of what she has done, or want to be associated with it.&&&8
Academy Awards&&&Academy awards sucked big time. Affleck got that award and did no acting in that dumb movie with Cloony as the co-producer. Cloony did not even act in The American....and he thought he was going to win an Oscar and almost jumped out of his chair when they announced the winner. Then he covered his face and cried. That idiot moderator was an obnoxious sick joke liberal moron. He was the worst one ever. He tried to be Bill big nose M and looked like the idiot that he is. Argo is not even worth seeing.

Big Island police were investigating the disappearance of a 46-year-old Hilo woman. Myra M. Hatayama was last heard from early Saturday morning, police said. "A detective is assigned to the case," Criminal Investigations Section Lt. Gregory Esteban said. "We have concerns about her disappearance. At this point, we cannot exclude foul play. We are following some leads." Hatayama is described as 5 feet tall and about 110 pounds, with shoulder-length brown hair, brown eyes and a tan complexion. She was last seen wearing a gray tank top, gray shorts and slippers.&&&28

We are forced into a pool of very costly patients, of which insurance underwriters reap no profits, therefore providing little care other than Hospice.

Micronesians in my hood&&&A Micronesian family (looks more like 10 families) resides in our neighborhood. Approx 20 people reside in a modest size 3-bedroom SINGLE home. Since they moved in 6 months ago, the neighborhood went to crap  literally. They have a two car garage, like everyone else. But they have up to 10 cars (that's right 10 cars!!!) park on the street. How in the world can a 3 bedroom house need 10 cars?!?! Their cars park right in front of my house and I live 3 houses away! And we're talking a normal thing here not some party theyre having. And speaking of parties, I think thats all they do. Almost every other night, they have people hanging around in their front yard sucking up beers and soda talking story often until 2 a.m. on a WEEKDAY. And during the day, the house is still full of people. J-O-B?? Nope, not in their vocabulary. I swear that out of the 10+ adults in that home, 2 or 3 work. The rest stay home all day and do NOTHING. Sit around and do NOTHING. The owner of the house could care less because hes the quintessential slumlord and hes content knowing that his rent checks will come in BECAUSE THEY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE GOVT. And you think that Micronesian family is an anomaly? Hardly. I have had other friends say the same thing they reproduce like rabbits yet have NO means to pay for the healthcare, education and proper upbringing of their children. They come to Hawaii knowing that they can leach off our generous system more kids?? no problem MORE VOUCHERS. Free food, shelter, healthcare, all while our local families are struggling. I apologize for stereotyping but with these grim statistics - 20% of our homeless shelters are full of these people while they only represent 1% of the islands population. HOW CAN I NOT STEREOTYPE??? Keep these leaches off our island. We have more than enough locals struggling to get by. We dont need any more people migrating here and sucking our already lacking system bone dry. And why does our STATE system need to subsidize these peoples healthcare, housing and food expense? Last checked it was the FEDERAL govt that decided to test nukes, NOT HAWAII. Have the US govt build a hospital in Micronesia to help the people theyve sickened. Why is it OUR burden???&&&294

Also, the 'US did nuclear testing in their homeland' defense is weak. Regardless of the past tragedy, they must live by the same laws as the rest of society.&&&188

Don't say GAY in Tennessee&&&The slo mo Hawaii should take some notes... A controversial bill widely known as "Don't Say Gay" has been revived, after biting the dust in 2012. It came out of the Tennessee Senate Education Committee on Tuesday. The bill's been labeled "don't say gay" because it prohibits teachers from discussing sexual orientations other than heterosexuality through 8th grade, even with kids who have gay family members. It also bans books and other materials that mention homosexuality. The latest version of the bill also includes an amendment that gay rights sympathizers are interpreting as requiring teachers to tell parents if their child is gay or suspected of being gay. The amendment allows school principals and other staff to mention homosexuality to students "engaging in, or may be at risk of engaging in, behavior injurious to the physical or mental health and well-being of the student or another person," according to the bill. However, the measure provides that "parents or legal guardians of such students shall be notified as soon as practicable of the circumstances requiring intervention." The bill is sponsored by Sen. Stacey Campfield (R), who made headlines yesterday with a bill requiring kids to earn welfare payments with good grades. Campfield says he favors "tolerance" of homosexuality but not "acceptance," and is simply trying to ensure teachers "don't have to teach about homosexuality to your second-graders [and] can spend more time on arithmetic."&&&7

Last year, Hawaii had proportionally fewer residents without health insurance than almost every other state. Still, the state did have significant economic and financial troubles.

Why Do liberals Lie so much?&&&Why Do Liberals Lie So Much? Author Izzy Weird Conservatives and especially Christian conservatives find it hard to comprehend how and why liberals lie so easily. Many liberals seem to lie without the slightest guilt or compunction. For left-wing politics, lying goes back to the Russian Bolsheviks or earlier. The masses were lied to because the ruling elite (or the ruling elite to be) felt that the ends (Marxism) justified any means, and the masses were too stupid and ignorant to know what was good for them. But the ruling elite knew exactly what was good for them. Leftists have a rather low opinion of the masses, the average citizen. Liberalism is like a religion, and it has zealots as fanatical as any other religion. But unlike most religions, liberalism has no moral code. The closest thing to a moral code in liberalism is dont get caught. Ethics are situational, and totally up for interpretation. The truth is subjective, and the truth is merely what you want it to be. To the fanatic the leftist cause is so noble, so sacred that any lying or cheating for the leftist cause is justified. When a liberal lies to the American public, he is in effect saying, You are too stupid to know what is good for you. I know what is good for you. I will say anything I need to say to convince you my way is the right way. If liberals were honest about their vision for this country few people would ever vote for them. Liberals must lie to us in order to impose the tyranny of liberalism upon us. Posted in Articles&&&22

MULE Trading 101&&&Mule Trading Curtis & Leroy saw an ad in the Starkville Daily in Starkville, MS. and bought a mule for $100. The farmer agreed to deliver the mule the next day. The next morning the farmer drove up and said,"Sorry, fellows, I have some bad news, the mule died last night." Curtis & Leroy replied, "Well, then just give us our money back." The farmer said,"Can't do that. I went and spent it already." They said, "OK then, just bring us the dead mule." The farmer asked, "What in the world ya'll gonna do with a dead mule?" Curtis said, "We gonna raffle him off." The farmer said, "You can't raffle off a dead mule!" Leroy said, "We shore can! Heck, we don't hafta tell nobody he's dead!" A couple of weeks later, the farmer ran into Curtis & Leroy at the Piggly Wiggly grocery store and asked. "What'd you fellers ever do with that dead mule?" They said,"We raffled him off like we said we wuz gonna do." Leroy said,"Shucks, we sold 500 tickets fer two dollars apiece and made a profit of $998." The farmer said,"My Lord, didn't anyone complain?" Curtis said, "Well, the feller who won got upset. So we gave him his two dollars back." Curtis and Leroy now work for the government.

CONGRESS FREEBIES&&&This is worth the time to read. I found this interesting, Children of congress members do not have to pay back their college student loans. How nice! In addition, the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans. This will get national attention if other news networks will broadcast it. 35 States have filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government. Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon them. It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention. This will take less than thirty seconds to read. If you agree, please pass it on. This is an idea that we should address. For too long, we've been too complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens have no idea members of Congress can retire with the samepay even after only ONE term! They specifically exempted themselvesfrom many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from anyfear of prosecution for sexual harassment) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the Health-care Reform... in all its forms. We should not have an elite that's above the law! I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. This self-serving must stop! If each person who receives this will forward it to 20 people, in threedays, most people in The United States of America will have the message. This is one proposal that really should be passed around. Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution: "Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and/or Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States ."&&&1

So do you believe that alien exist ?&&&I get this question alot from friends. So here is what I Dwain Sawh believe about aliens. 1. I believe that aliens do exist and have been visiting earth for a long time. There are records and pictures of aliens visiting earth back thousands of year ago, and back then there were no man made flying objects. Think about it the Universe is so big we cannot possible be the only one around. So go figure... 2. Human being may have been kind of like science projects of aliens. I believe that they may have altered the DNA of humans to be more like them. I believe they keep coming back to earth to montor us and see how far we have progressed. 3. There may be different species of aliens some good and some bad. 4. I beleive that governments around the world may have knowledge and contact with alien and are keeping it a secret from the rest of the us because they are trying to avoid world wide panic. Which may or may not be a good thing. Aliens may even be helping some governments in developing advanced technology. 5. I believe that god is not who we think he/she is. Yes there may be a supreme being more advanced than even aliens. But you have to realize that back before the wheel was invented aliens visited earth and were far more advanced than our ancestors and some of the things that they were able to perform were very impressive to our ancestors that they started worshipping as the supreme being (God). 6. Aliens may be so advanced that they may be able to disguised themselves as humans or any other thing they want and we cannot even tell they are aliens. They may even be able to make themselves invisible when they want. They may have technology where they can travel millions of miles if just seconds. Traveling from a distant planet to earth may only take them seconds. Just because we don't have that technoloyg as yet does not mean it cannot exist else where in the Universe. 7. I think governments around the world should spend more time and money trying to explore space because that holds the key to future of humans. There now you know what I think about aliens (Extraterrestrial life )&&&34

Read How Ronald Reagan Ruined California or How He Set the Crazys Free&&&PBS Frontline on the #s from the Daily Nugget: quote: The Ugly: the closing of mental health hospitals in California and across the United States. Is it any wonder that California seems to have all of the crazy homeless people? State mental hospitals were taken away by Governor Reagan in the seventies, and federal mental health programs were later taken away by President Reagan in the eighties. When Ronald Reagan was governor of California he systematically began closing down mental hospitals, later as president he would cut aid for federally-funded community mental health programs. It is not a coincidence that the homeless populations in the state of California grew in the seventies and eighties. The people were put out on the street when mental hospitals started to close all over the state. Seeing an increase in crime, and brutal murders by Herb Mullin, a mental hospital patient, the state legislature passed a law that would stop Reagan from closing even more state-funded mental health hospitals. But Reagan would not be outdone. In 1980, congress proposed new legislation (PL 96-398) called the community mental health systems act (crafted by Ted Kennedy), but the program was killed by newly-elected President Ronald Reagan. This action ended the federal community mental health centers (see timeline on this link) program and its funding.&&&17

Ed Case and Neil Abercrombie both served in Congress, but are also on the downslope of their careers. Gabbard is a vet, has youth, and was duly elected to the House. Since "seniority" is "everything" in Congress, Tulsi should be chosen. Right now, Hawaii has zilch to lose, but putting Hanabusa in there would guarantee we lose seniority again in the not too distant future, coz Colleen and Mazie ain't spring chickens. A "thin bench" indeed.&&&1

Inouye apparently forgave Case for daring to bring up the notion of succession planning in his run against Akaka. It's time to acknowledge that Ed was right.

Not a private contractor but govt. vehicle. Of course two lanes are completely closed, after sitting in stopped traffic we arrive where HPD is sitting there while a couple guys are raking rocks and one is sweeping around them. However, the view makai is as beautiful as can be found anywhere in the world so who cares. lololol People save $$$ their entire lives just to see this view one time.&&&5

Schools must get grip on campus discipline&&&Aloha, This is a National, State, Federal and Parental issue and not one that places blame on one or two parties. It's OUR problem as Americans. There are so many contributing factors as was written about during the past two weeks. Don't forget about our society and media influences with Sex and Violence. Where do you get your writing info! We are lucky that another Columbine HS tragedy did not occur YET...... So..........before you single out the Parents you should consider all of the players including the HPD! We need everyones input and attention here with ALL Accountable Parties stepping up to the plate to hit one over the fence instead of throwing stones at the kids and their parents. It's obvious that some adults have not grown up either and need old fashion detention duty. Hoping for Community Action Statewide because more serious outcomes are in the wings if we continue to point the finger. One of the hardest things to do in this Life is to point the finger back at yourself and when one really looks at a given situation with an open mind to include a fix, there is always something we could have done for the sake of prevention. Many folks too are afraid of rocking the boat for one reason or another that does not help either. Let's hit a Homerun! With Aloha, Moke Young&&&112

Harmful Effects of ETHANOL Gasoline&&&Disadvantages of using Ethanol: &#149;Production of ethanol requires significant energy and large amounts of land &#149;Fuels with more than 10% ethanol are not compatible with non E85-ready fuel system components and may cause corrosion of ferrous components. &#149;Can negatively affect electric fuel pumps by increasing internal wear and undesirable spark generation. &#149;Is not compatible with capacitance fuel level gauging indicators and may cause erroneous fuel quantity indications in vehicles that employ that system. &#149;Not always compatible with marine craft, especially those that use fiberglass tanks. &#149;Decreases fuel-economy by 15-30%. &#149;Tough materials are needed to accommodate a higher compression ratio to make an ethanol.......Ethanol Sucks Ethanol Added to Gasoline causes: Reduced Engine Power Reduced Fuel Economy Accelerated Engine Wear Deterioration of Fuel System Components Increased Repair Shop Visits Increased Fuel Pump Failures There are only two viable solutions: Use ( hard to find ) Ethanol Free Gasoline or use an additive that actually reverse the harmful effects of Ethanol.

Hawaii Rail - Satan's project&&&We're starting to find out there's some reeeally evil shet going on behind the scenes involving this rail that is supposedly being built "to help ease traffic" for our poor fellow citizens on the stuck on the West side. Uh...huh Read on.. As election day nears, a former insider at Pacific Resource Partnership (PRP), the pro-rail PAC, has come clean about the groups venal and possibly illegal tactics. Coincidentally, as this story was going to press, Former Gov. Ben Cayetano, the target of PRPs relentless (and discredited) campaign, announced that he was suing the PAC, its executive director, John White, and its parent organization, the carpenters union, for libel and slander. PRP commercials alleging that Cayetano violated campaign contributions law when he ran for governor have been refuted by many, including Bob Watada, who was then-executive director of the State Campaign Spending Commission (CSC). But the unsavory PAC and its partner, I Mua Rail, continue to saturate the airwaves and Star-Advertiser pages with misleading ads. To keep big (and anonymous) money from stealing Honolulus election, the Weekly obtained an exclusive interview with Justin Hahn, a former PRP employee anguished by what he saw and bravely willing to go on the record. In mayoral debates, Caldwell has refused to disavow PRPs smear tactics and has denied that videotape in PRP ads had been supplied by his campaign, even though his website displays many of the same images. While he did not condone PRPs ads, Caldwell said,If I told [PRP] to stop, it would be coordination. He was referring to CSC rules that prohibit independent expenditure committees, such as PRP, from coordinating political activity with candidates.&&&60

Election Poll, June 2012 - Honolulu, HI&&&Important -Search "They Live moment of revelation" on Youtube if the above clip stops working. If this was real what would you do? If there were really aliens that saw us as dumb expendable animals would you just sit back and take their abuse. Would it make any difference if "they" were a small group of people known as the illuminati? The movie "They Live" made in the 1980's predicted everything that has happened and will probably come to pass in terms of citizen surveillance, drones, and pyschological warfare in America. Watch the whole movie. The same thing that happened to Nazi Germany when the citizenry embraced Nazism is happening to us. The populace was dumbed down and manipuated by the illuminati and their bought out politicians and media into being a prideful yet mindless war machine. When the illuminati were done with Germany they were left a defeated, bankrupt and villified nation. No one gives a crap today when the German people say they were lead astray by their bought out politicians. The world is simply glad that in the end they got what they deserved. America is heading down the same path. We used to be the beacon of freedom to the world but now our country has become a modern day Nazi Germany war machine starting unprovoked wars across the globe. Many people now spit at us when we visit their countries like we are villains. If and when we are weakened internally/financially to the point that we leave ourselves open to military attack by countries like Russia and China people will cheer our demise. We have become the bad guys because we presently ALLOW a psychopathic offshore banking cartel to run our country through bought off politicians. That Three Stooges clip sums up the illuminatis mindset very well -our last few Presidents have acted just like dictators. Occupy Wall Street was started by the illuminati to weaken America and take the focus off them when the global economic collapse occurs. It then got out of control because people started focusing in on the private Federal Reserve. Now the illuminati is trying to clamp down on this movement because we are focusing on them and they are extremely nervous. Wallstreet and the banks are a symptom of a greater problem. There is nothing wrong with capitalism or corporations however what we now have is crony capitalism, not true capitalism. We must swarm Washington DC and the 12 Federal Reserve Bank locations in the U.S. with massive demonstrations if we are going to take our country back. Any Occupy Wallstreet movement outside of Washington DC or the 12 Federal Reserve Bank locations is a distraction designed to keep the movement fractionalized. We must occupy the main problem, not the symptoms. Never take freedom for granted. If you love America defend it today by getting informed and taking this country back for Americans. We WILL prevail because clearly Americans aren't going to put up with this shit any longer. The time is now. This one show explains everything going on. It will change your life when you see how the mainstream media is manipulating us like cattle using the political Left Vs Right paradigm. Download the podcasts and listen. This is our reality: Here's my take on it. Don't be afraid to speak out as we are all on some type of list by now: You have to understand that free speech on the net is about to be clamped down on in America -mainland China style. Get the sunglasses and spread the word before it's too late. Learn to spot/ignore government paid trolls.&&&102

Obama calls Romney a bullsh**ter&&&LOL!!!!! Obama calling someone a bullsheeter is like Ted Kennedy calling someone a drunk or Bill Clinton calling someone a womanizer. Its obvious Obama is in full blown desperation mode resorting to lies, smears, petty attacks and juvenile namecalling.. while Romney ignores the idiot...refuses to stoop to his level, doesnt take the troll bait...and instead stays focused on the issues,...expressing optism and hope for the future.. This is the kind of leader America needs.. ROMNEY/RYAN 2012!!&&&6

Lawyer contends baby death case was 'mishandled' - Hawaii News&&&The infant was sleeping on the sofa and when she returned from using the bathroom the infant was found face down unresponsive on the floor. A 7 week infant is unable to turn himself yet so it's rather suspicous finding him on the floor! Something doesn't sound right! And a it takes a lot of force to detach a retina even for an infant. Should never leave a baby unattended even for a few seconds.&&&31
#8: Levi Stanley - Cards&&&It would be awesome to be able to view some of the UH football highlights of the 70's and 80's. I would even pay to see it. Distinct memories of the rainbow striped pants, white helmets w/the warrior on it, high white socks, cut jerseys, etc...&&&4

Can't wait to read the posts that will show up describing Waianae as a beautiful source of aloha. The area is full of brutal creeps who will outnumber you, beat you down dead, and then threaten your family and witnesses with the same. I saw these apes blubbering on TV, feigning remorse, seeking release and mercy. Too bad ten years is the max that they could get. The sniveling cowards deserve life.&&&132
Are 20 Minute Evictions Real?&&&There has been a lot of talk around campus about 20 minute evictions. Somebody said that that this happened to their grandparents, then somebody said that it happened to their Auntie. As I go out on the weekends, I overhear occasional conversations about how it happened to their best friend, a co-worker and so on. What is going on here? is this some kind of urban legend? I don't think that it is. So I Googled the information to see what I would come up. It appears that it happens a lot. Number seven down the list there were some that happened right here in Hawaii. Has anybody else heard about this? why isn't somebody doing something about it?&&&154

punahou high society&&&from another thread, remembered something that always bothered me and wonder if anyone else experienced similar. i'm connected to the school (but didnt go there) and my experience is punahou prima donnas out number down-to-earths about 5-1. several of my friends (nonpunahou)joined their punahou husbands at punahou reunions and everyone one of them complained about how rude and exclusive the punahou women are. these punahou grads can't relate to anyone else besides punahou alums and don't see any need to. frankly, i'm shocked anyone can develop that attitude in hawaii. maybe its the big fish/little pond thing.&&&702

But my Filipino Bloodline came from some of the Original Plantation Workers. I got LOCAL Flip Bloodline. All these ones straight from PI are fucking irritating. They're wannabees. Make all Filipinos look bad. They should be sent back to Manilla or wherever they came from. Anyone else feel this way ??&&&40
Text threatens Gabbard's life&&&In March, 2011 Gabbard obtained a three-year restraining order against Aniruddah Sherbow after he allegedly made a threatening phone call and pestered Gabbard with insults and vulgarities for three weeks. Sherbow was eventually arrested on suspicion of harassment, but it's unclear if he's involved in the most recent threat against Gabbard. Yu would not say if a suspect had been identified. A dude using this name was posting comments on Topix during the primary election...Wow, laulau. You get one restraining order against you, you should just move on in life--lesson learned--tail between your legs. Negative karma, brah. Negative karma.&&&5
Mazie is a hater&&&Anyone watch the Lingle Hirono debate? Mazie's every sentence started off with The Republicans did this or the Republicans did that. I guess when you don't have a record of accomplishment to stand on you make up lies about your opponent and then she expects to believe she'll get things done in Washington. Bullshit! The only thing she'll get done is spew hate and lies like she's been doing for years.&&&14

Religion is a waste of time, distraction&&&Religion is a waste of time. Instead of getting up early every sunday going to church why not sleep in a bit later on sundays. Sleep does a body and mind good. I have noticed that the more religious a person is the more evil they are. If a person has got to go confession every week, they must be doing a lot of evil. Religion is a wasted of time and a huge distraction that can be well spent on other more constructive things. Religion was created by aliens to control, divide and conquer humans. Without religion the world will be one big happy family.&&&24

Hawaii #1 in the entire nation in workplace ICE abuse&&&Hawaii leads the nation in methamphetamine use among its workforce, according to a new study by a major drug testing company. In millions of test samples analyzed in 2010, Hawaii had a dramatic lead -- 410 percent greater than the national average -- in tests coming up positive for the highly addictive drug stimulant, according to a Quest Diagnostics study obtained by The Associated Press. Quest was expected to release today the first state-by-state analysis of urine specimens collected from workplaces across the country. Arkansas followed Hawaii at 280 percent higher than the national average of one positive out of every 1,000 tests. Oklahoma had the third highest rate at 240 percent higher than the national average. A regional analysis of five-year data from the Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index shows a new trend emerging in meth use.&&&32

Leilehua blanks Waianae to make states - Sports&&&The Waianae football program is just a shell of its former self. I remember how they dominated the OIA in the 1970's. Ever since Waianae got whipped by Iolani in the 1980 Prep Bowl, they never been the same. That game marked the end of the former great Waianae football program. I had never seen Waianae get pushed around before, both sides of the ball, as they were in that game. Anyone got any theories as to what has happenned? Does Waianae still get the turnout of the entire student body as they did in the 70's? Are grades keeping some players out? Are top Waianae coast players being recruited by St Louis? Kamehameha always got their share of players from Waianae, like Richard Mello. Punahou stole Mark Tuinei.&&&67

'Iolani builds D-II dynasty - Sports News&&&Congratulations tro Iolani on a hard-fougt victory....bt, I take issue with some of the oficiating. They got a BIG break in th third quarter when their long 91-yard drive was kept alive with a susicious non-call. Their receiver stepped out-of-bounds yet was allowed to make a third down catch for a first down. Iolani may have had to punt or try a long field goal. Well, that's the breaks against Kauai High...they still had their chances and made errors.&&&19
Hawaii lucky to be free from gambling&&&Gambling already exists in Hawaii. It just isn't taxed now. Very naive editorial. I am neutral about it coming to Hawaii. It is something that the people should be able to vote on. I do believe that once Native Hawaiians get a nation within a nation and Senator Inouye retires, that legalized casinos will be in Hawaii.&&&84
Review: Laupahoehoe School-Muay Thai&&&These guys try to hustle you with "sign up fees", "6 months advance payment", and all kinds of other 24hr fitness type crap that ends up with you having to commit around $500 bucks just to come to their class and do tae bo with 30 other donkeys. Some of these guys have chips on their shoulder. Reminds me of the militant style of CobraKai from karate kid. Plus, these guys do the thai style bow, but don't no nothing about Thai culture, speak thai, or ever set foot in Thailand. If you want the real deal, go to Thailand and spend a month at a REAL training camp, eat spicy ass thaifood, and get in touch with real Thai culture. not these phonys.&&&7
Ameya Housing Dev. Gets Approval by PCIO and GFE&&&The Ameya Housing development near Kailua has been approved by PCIO and now only needs final approval by GFE.

The Obama administration notified Congress on Friday that it would provide Egypts new government an emergency cash infusion of $450 million, but the aid immediately encountered resistance from a prominent lawmaker wary of foreign aid and Egypts new course under the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood.&&&7

Obama-Economy - Honolulu, HI&&&no jobs, people in the USA have lost 10% of their net worthy in just the last two years *(news source), retirements lost, pensions lost, homes lost, jobs lost, all of this under obama. The national debt has gone up by $6Trillion dollars in 3 years under obama and no jobs have been created. Now he says he needs another chance as a lame duck president. For what? If he couldn't do it going into his wannabee second term, he sure can't do it when he has nothing to lose. no way. VOTE! this guy out!&&&18
Health Care - Honolulu, HI&&&I don't trust Nancy Polosi in Congress or our current President. To force everyone to purchase health care (if you want it or not) IS A TAX INCREASE ON ALL AMERICANS. If you don't want it, or if don't pay the fine because you don't want it, they can throw you in jail! That is insane! Btw- The dems now do want to cover illegal immigrants who broke the law to get into America! So, I guess Congressional Rep. Joe Wilson was correct when he said "You Lie!". Illegal immigrants who didn't obey basic American immigration laws should be sent back home and get health care in the country they illegally came from!&&&39

Why doesn't this get more attention?&&&I've been seeing more and more news about anti-Japanese sentiment by Chinese because of their claims of "Japanese imperialism" over the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands, but what about the other countries affected by what is looking like "Chinese imperialism"? The Philippines are being forced out of the Scarborough Shoal by the Chinese navy and other countries, like Vietnam, are being bullied out of the Spratly Islands. China is trying to steal (as with the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, or Taiwan) or outright bully (as with Japan) their way into ownership of one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, yet I hardly hear anything about it. They didn't care about any of these mostly uninhabitable islands until it was discovered they may contain large stores of natural resources. Why aren't people protesting the Chinese embassies around the world the way they're protesting the Japanese?&&&4
Bashing Senior Unemployed Into Disabled Social Security&&&Your senior unemployed relative does not fit the legal criteria for disabled social security. They are legally unemployed. They have accepted unemployment benefits and extended unemployment. The first question they ask you when you apply each week is "Are you able and available to work?" They are senior workers. It is too difficult for them to get work in a hard economy. Operation Able says, the older worker is "able and capable." If you are advising social security and drugs, or if you are telling your relative he is "lazy, crazy, or stupid" because he cannot obtain work then it is considered abusive-- legally abusive. YOU ARE CHANGING PEOPLES OPINION. You are tainting their character,their education, experience and credentials for work. The National Center For Mental Health says, "You deserve to be treated with kindness and respect,and you have the right to control your own mental health care." Your relative knows about every social service there is. They go to the food banks. They choose their own doctors. See a therapist yourself.&&&4

Why are they angry at us? a film?&&&Global anger: The protests spread Yemen The furore across the Middle East over the controversial film about the Prophet Mohamed is now threatening to get out of control. In Sana'a, the Yemeni capital, yesterday around 5,000 demonstrators attacked the US embassy, leaving at least 15 people injured. Young protesters, shouted: "We sacrifice ourselves for you, Messenger of God," smashed windows of the security offices and burned at least five cars, witnesses said. Egypt Egypt's Islamist President Mohamed Morsi yesterday condemned the attack in Benghazi that killed the US ambassador. In a speech in Brussels, Mr Morsi said he had spoken to President Obama and condemned "in the clearest terms" the Tuesday attacks. Despite this, and possibly playing to a domestic audience, President Obama said yesterday that "I don't think we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy". Demonstrators in Cairo attacked the mission on Tuesday evening and protests have continued since. Iraq Militants said the anti-Islamic film "will put all the American interests Iraq in danger" and called on Muslims everywhere to "face our joint enemy", as protesters in Baghdad burned American flags yesterday. The warning from the Iranian-backed group Asaib Ahl al-Haq came as demonstrators demanded the closure of the US embassy in the capital. Bangladesh Islamists warned they may "besiege" the US embassy in Dhaka after security forces stopped around 1,000 protesters marching to the building. The Khelafat Andolon group called for bigger protests as demonstrators threw their fists in the air, burned the flag and chanted anti-US slogans. Others There was a Hamas-organised protest in Gaza City, and as many as 100 Arab Israelis took to the streets in Tel Aviv. In Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai postponed a trip to Norway, fearing violence. Officials in Pakistan said they "expected protests". Protesters in Tunis burnt US flags.&&&11
Mitt Romney,guest blogger on Topix&&&Thank you, Topix, for allowing me to take over your blogging enterprise. I don't see many assets here, but we might be able to to increase profits by replacing you and your commenters with a couple of Bangladeshi kids--they'll do anything for a few grains of rice. We'll talk about that later, I have other corpses to baptise right now. That's a metaphor. My advisers tell me I should use them, so I do, a lot, like when I say Obama's policies closed that plant in Wisconsin back when Bush was president. That was a metaphor. Same goes for when I pretended I was poor in college. It was a metaphor. Don't ask me to explain. Just like it, because it's a metaphor and I could take your business, sell all the assets, and replace all the workers with Bangladeshi kids. I'm going to do that anyway, but like I said, we'll talk about it later. You may have noticed how I boldly got ahead of the president on the Libyan situation, this morning. It was a gutsy gambit, but I saw it as a great opportunity to create my own reality, a reality in which people might actually vote for me. The Bangladeshi kid who writes my metaphors says I was successful. He called my speech a "large, two-beetle-worthy ball of elephant dung." I love that. I'll have to use it before Ryan claims he wrote it while on safari. I thought it was important to act quickly. That will be one of the defining features of my foreign policy. I'll quickly respond to developing situations to avoid the possibility that emerging facts might temper my response. It's like I said, "the first response should be outrage" That's what American foreign policy will look like in a Romney administration--think of it as "W-heavy," all the anger and viciousness of the Bush years, but more rash and much less adulterated by contemplation. That's all the time I have. Ann's cooking away at the stove (hey, another metaphor) making good old-fashioned American comfort food: broiled Scottish hare with Muskovy foie gras and truffles.&&&4

Romney uses the death of our Ambassador for political gain&&&In the hours after the death of the first U.S. ambassador killed in decades, Mitt Romney panicked as his poll numbers have slipped punched hard against the president, unleashing an unwise, inaccurate and unpresidential attack on the Obama administration. Despite the fact that U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya came under attack after that embassy statement, with crowds besieging the Cairo embassy and the consulate in Benghazi in the late hours of September 11, the campaign released a statement from Romney saying, "It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks."

ROMNEY IS UP 8 points over Obama now!&&&"The latest CNN/ORC poll released today shows a wider lead for President Obama than the previous CNN/ORC poll but it is doubly skewed. It massively under-samples independents while it also over-samples Democratic voters. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll official reports Obama at 52 to percent and Mitt Romney at 46 percent. Unskewed, the data reveals a 53 percent to 45 percent lead for Romney. This new CNN/ORC survey, unlike many other analyzed, not only over-samples Democratic voters, but also massively under-samples independent voters, to produce a result more favorable to Barack Obama. This survey's sample includes 397 registered Republicans and 441 registered Democrats. But the survey included a total of 822 registered voters, leaving only 37 independent voters at most. The survey clearly under-sampled independent and Republican voters. Among the Democrats survey, 97 percent favored Obama while three percent support Romney. The Republicans surveys chose Romney by a 96 percent to two percent margin. Those margins display a high degree of party loyalty in each party for its candidate, which is plausible in a campaign like this one where both sides are focusing heavily on boosting turnout among their base. Independents, who are massively under-sampled in this survey, support Romney by a 54 percent to 40 percent margin. The sample for the CNN/ORC poll includes 50.4 percent Democrats and 45.4 percent Republicans and appears to have only 4.2 percent independents. This means independents are under-sampled 25 percent while Democrats are over-sampled 12.1 percent. Both of those are larger variations in sampling than seen in most polls that are likewise skewed by such sampling variations. Rasmussen Reports recent reporting of partisan trends among voters, based on tens of thousands of voters surveyed, showed the voting electorate made up of 35.4 percent Republicans, 34.0 percent Democrats and 30.5 percent Unaffiliated or independent voters. Clearly 6.5 percent of a sample as independents is a large under-sampling of those voters compared to 30.5 percent. Unskewing this data to make up for the likely 25 percent under-sampling of independent voters shows the results are quite different. With the weightings of independents, Democrats and Republicans conducted by the Rasmussen numbers, this poll's data would indicate a Romney lead over Obama of 53 percent to 45 percent. That is almost exactly the reverse of the 52 percent to 46 percent lead it reports in favor of Obama. The sampling skew of this poll actually reverses the result that should be shown by the data.' lol...bottom line: polls are rigged. Romney is up by 5-7 points now over obama.&&&18

Insurer punished for failing to pay claim - News&&&Mr. Love and HEMIC insurance providers of Workmans Comp likes to go on TV with his stupid commercial claiming what a wonderful company they are. They are for the companies they represent but now we know if you are injured on the job they will fight you all the way to trial. I also was injured on the job and was denied benefits from the beginning. My employer refused to accept my injury(fear of higher premiums) even though I had witnesses (police reports)and followed the proper procedure.They even denied paying the ambulance and emergency bill. The insurance company (First Insurance) along with the company put me through 18 months of severe pain both mantally and physically. My family suffered along with me. Finally I had to go get a lawyer who filed the necessary papers and retrieved my rights.The reason HEMIC and other insurance companies boasts that they are returning premiums to these companies is because they will deny you benefits and fight you all the way if you are hurt and most will give up without any benefits. I hope no one gets injured on the job but if you do seek a Attorney at the begginning because thats the only way you will recieve help. Because of their failure to help me at the begginning I am crippled for life. Everytime I see one of their commercials I think about the injured workers under their coverage and the suffering they will be going through. Evil and greed is their motto.&&&45

"WND EXCLUSIVE GOP delegates in Tampa invite Sheriff Joe to speak Amid Obama probe, DOJ lawsuit, he's 'wildly popular' throughout the nation Published: 5 mins ago author-image by Jerome R. CorsiEmail | Archive Jerome R. Corsi, a Harvard Ph.D., is a WND senior staff reporter. He has authored many books, including No. 1 N.Y. Times best-sellers "The Obama Nation" and "Unfit for Command." Corsi's latest book is "Where's the REAL Birth Certificate?"More &#8595; Amid his battle with the Justice Department and his investigation of Obamas eligibility, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has been asked to address a large audience of delegates to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. The invitation-only reception for delegates from Western states will be held Aug. 30 at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa. Elephants, appropriately, are expected to be at the GOP event. Sheriff Joe is a good friend and a great Republican, said Tom Morrissey, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. Noting Arpaio is a former member of the Electoral College representing Arizona, Morrissey said the sheriff is wildly popular, not just in Maricopa County, but throughout the state and the country. Hes done a lot for the Republican Party already, and were overjoyed that as always he is willing to join us as we visit some of our fellow elephants while in Tampa, the GOP leader said. Arpaio has called for a congressional investigation to examine Obamas presidential eligibility under Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution. His Cold Case Posse investigative team has concluded the long-form birth certificate posted on the White House website is a computer-generated forgery. The team also has concluded Obamas Selective Service Registration form was forged. See Sheriff Joe Arpaios most recent press conference on Obamas eligibility Meanwhile, in a lawsuit, the Department of Justice has charged Arpaio with racially profiling Latinos in his immigration patrols. Arpaio vehemently denies the charge and has challenged the DOJ to provide concrete evidence.

The Secret To Not Paying Income Tax&&&Ever since the last presidential election, we can remember slogans from Obama. The ones that come to mind are, "Yes We Can" and all the talk about "Change". I can't tell you enough how glad I am with all these wonderful new upgrades to my pocketbook. Because by being unemployed I'm saving a fortune in income tax that I don't need to pay. Think about the candidates being propped up on both the Republican and Democrat side. As usual it's the same old Wall Street bankers backing the lineups. I keep wondering why people keep voting for New World Order candidates. Is it because they didn't learn their lessons from Obama and Bush? Or is it something much deeper than that? is it a complete mass hypnosis with most Americans being asleep at the wheel? Whatever it is, just remember this. There are only two types of candidates to vote for. Those who care about America and those who only care about the promise that they have made to international bankers who have financed them.(Corruption?) My decision is final, I'll vote for America.

As the news media scrambles to identify the so-called mystery speaker scheduled to address GOP delegates on Thursday evening, some have speculated that the iconic Hollywood figure could fit the bill. Our source  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  could not confirm if Eastwood is, in fact, the intriguing to-be-announced speaker, but stated unequivocally that the Dirty Harry star will arrive in Florida late on Wednesday or early on Thursday, and will return to southern California on Friday.

We finally have an intelligent and smart president who is respected around the worl instead of that idiot Bush. Obama is not so trigger happy and doesn't send young men off to die at the bat of an eye. I caution those who view this film and come out singing America.

BIRTHER in CHIEF&&&BETWEEN THE LINES 'America doesn't need a birther-in-chief' Exclusive: Joseph Farah spotlights irony of Obama campaign's response to Romney joke Published: 5 hours ago TAMPA, Fla. In rapid response to Mitt Romneys joke to a crowd in his home state of Michigan, that No one ever asked me for my birth certificate, Barack Obamas campaign put out a 15-second TV spot to declare,America doesnt need a birther-in-chief. Ive finally found a point of agreement with Obama. America certainly does not need a birther-in-chief which is one of at least 2,012 reasons to dump Barack Obama from the White House on Election Day. America already has a birther-in-chief. His name is Barack Obama. Who started the controversy over his identity? He did. For at least 17 years he boasted in his literary biography of being born in Kenya. That claim was quietly withdrawn only in 2007  less than a year before he declared his candidacy for the presidency. It was never repudiated or explained. His own wife referred to Kenya as his home country. His autobiography claims he is the offspring of two parents, neither of which could bestow upon him the constitutional requirement of natural born citizenship. When repeatedly asked for years into his presidency to produce his birth certificate, he released a document every expert who has looked at it agrees is fraudulent  including the one and only law enforcement investigation to examine the evidence. No one else besides Barack Obama can claim credit for the title birther-in-chief. He owns it. He prompted the very term. He sustained it needlessly. And then he blames others for his own absolute unwillingness to provide the most rudimentary documentation of his eligibility for office. Im gratified Mitt Romney told that joke. Im only sorry he apologized for it later. Because the Constitution is not a laughing matter  or it shouldnt be. Its Obama who has made it such. He has demonstrated over and over again that he has nothing but contempt for the Constitution. And then his own amen-corner feigns righteous indignation that we shouldnt accept on faith his unsubstantiated claims to constitutional eligibility for office. One of the things I would like you to notice is the crowd reaction Romney got to his little joke. It was enthusiastic. They werent just laughing. They were applauding. They were thinking,Its about time Romney brought this up. Everyone in America knew exactly what he meant. Why is that? Why is Obamas birth certificate one of the biggest sources of controversy and humor after nearly four years in office? Ill tell you why: Because Americans know Obamas hiding virtually all documentation about his true identity. Only the media elite dont seem to understand the obvious  because of their collective failure to honestly investigate what could prove to be a story bigger than Watergate and the Teapot Dome scandal combined. And the news media dont even appreciate any jokes that reflect on their ineptitude and calculated cover-up of the truth. I wouldnt be surprised to see Mitt Romney get a nice bump in the pre-convention polls as a result of his birth certificate challenge. Fundamental issues like constitutional qualifications are important to Americans  and they know theyve been snookered in the case of Barack Obama. Obamas true life story is as much a mystery today as it was in 2008. His story doesnt add up. His arrogant, steadfast unwillingness to release virtually any documentation  from a legitimate birth certificate to his school records to his travel papers to his health reports and more  makes it clear to thinking Americans that somethings not right here. All that smoke suggests a fire. Only the darlings of the media elite are too dumb, too guilty of complicity or too self-interested to admit the obvious. Romney should keep poking them all in the eye by telling that joke. That says it all!&&&4

HOPE AND CHANGE!&&&Obama called me last night. he was worried about his election. The message he left was this: "...hi, Barack here. I just wanted to let you all know that I will do my job on my next term and not play so much golf like I did this time. I will do anything to stay in office, and I will even compromise this time. I really want to stay in office, so trust me, I will do my job over the next 4 years even though I decided not to do my job the last 4 years. I am sorry that I wasted 4 years of everybody's life and ruined your businesses that you did not create, and foreclosed on your homes that we took from you, while taking away 40% of your net worth. I am also sorry that you will have to work the rest of your miserable little lives because you cannot afford to retire now, but that is the way it goes. So please vote for me in November.

Condo owners at Honolulu's Admiral Thomas want their deposits back&&&Its alright because it goes along with the philosophy of the pretend Christian charity expressed by the people who get served raw bacon along with their under-cooked pancakes every Sunday morning. When someone complained about the bacon being raw the helpful Christian people said, "Shut up it's free isn't it?" The Chief Minister Agreed and added that she has no control over the group that they are wonderful people who get up early to serve the food...So logic like that leaves me less than surprised at the flip attitude demonstrated here.&&&2
Tripler has a colorful tale to tell&&&On one of my visits to Hawaii I was in a van from the airport to my hotel with several tourists. the lady sitting in front of me must have read every tourist book. As we headed for Waikiki she turned to her husband and said; "oh look , the Royal Hawaiian Hotel" pointing towards the hospital. I corrected her telling her it was Tripler Army Hospital. She replied but its painted pink. I couldn't control myself and said;"They must have had the same decorator." T&&&33

State Supreme Court hands rail opponents victory over burials&&&We do not need tons of concrete poured on every available space and a lot of not currently available places so that a few politicians can line their pockets and taxpayers can pay for it for years. While it eventually sits rusted out and unused. A million $ plus fund for attys just to fight opposition to the thing yet Kiewit's contract is completely in Kiewit's favor. Who slipped up and used taxpayer funded attys to force it thru while Kiewit was writing their own terms? They win even if it is cancelled. But 10 caissons knocked down is nothing compared to 370 destroying everything IN THEIR PATH. Look at how everything else here is sadly neglected these days with our $$$$ funneled to this white elephant UNWANTED train. Hopefully in the next few days the thing will be PAU.&&&1

Cynthia Thielen ahead of Pohai Ryan in East Oahu Senate Race&&&I guess Pohai Ryan can thank her own Democratic Party for giving Thielen free publicity by causing a stir over her "Democratic" faithfulness.

Much of Hawaii already thinks you're a petty lot, and your leadership is egotistical and arrogantly focused on power and influence. Your 50 years of domination is slowly slipping through your fingers because you have abandoned your core values that got you there to begin with. Say "good-bye," Senator Ryan. Your party has given Thielen the gift of free, positive publicity. Good job, Dante. Just like when you were mayor.&&&11

NEW OBAMACARE TAX On YOUR REAL ESTATE!&&&****URGENT!!! New obamacare TAX on your HOUSE and any real estate you own! Subject: HOME SALES TAX When does your home become part of your health care? After 2012! Your vote counts big time in 2012, make sure you and all your friends and family know about this ! HOME SALES TAX I thought you might find this interesting,-- maybe even SICKENING! The National Association of Realtors is all over this and working to get it repealed,-- before it takes effect. But, I am very pleased we aren't the only ones who know about this ploy to steal billions from unsuspecting homeowners. How many realtors do you think will vote Democratic in 2012? Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it? That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home, etc. When did this happen? It's in the health care bill,-- and it goes into effect in 2013. Why 2013? Could it be so that it doesnt come to light until after the 2012 elections? So, this is change you can believe in? Under the new health care bill all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% sales tax. If you sell a $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation,-- who often downsize their homes. Does this make your November, 2012 vote more important? Oh, you weren't aware that this was in the ObamaCare bill? Guess what; you aren't alone! There are more than a few members of Congress that weren't aware of it either. You can check this out for yourself at: ... I hope you forward this to every single person in your address book. VOTERS NEED TO KNOW.&&&3
Huntsville Utah ROCKS!&&&HUNTSVILLE, Utah  A parade entry portraying President Barack Obama and using the term Obamanation has made some angry, and others upset at the negative attention. It happened in the citys annual Fourth of July parade. The float showed a person dressed as President Obama with one sign that read Huntsville Welcomes Obamas Farewell Tour? On the back, another sign said,Ask about our assault gun plan. Call Eric Holder. On one side of the issue, people are saying the float was disrespectful and had no place in a patriotic parade. The other side says it was all in good fun. Huntsville Mayor Jim Truett and City Council member Laurie Allen say the entry doesnt reflect the views of the city. They say it was entered at the last minute, not through usual protocol and they would not have approved it if they had seen it. I dont think we would have allowed it, in fact I know we wouldnt, said Allen.We just dont want that. Its a family-oriented celebration. Weber County Sheriff Chief Deputy Klint Anderson told Fox 13 News his department contacted the Secret Service after some residents expressed concern the float was a threat to the President. We dont decide whats appropriate. Thats up to the town, the parade organizers and the people who design the float, Anderson said. Click link to watch the video!&&&4

OBAMA PREDICTED to LOSE BIG BY NATIONAL STUDY&&&Analysis of election factors points to Romney win, University of Colorado study says August 22, 2012  Social Sciences Quotes- What is striking about our state-level economic indicator forecast is the expectation that Obama will lose almost all of the states currently considered as swing states, including North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire, Colorado, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, said Kenneth Bickers of CU-Boulder A University of Colorado analysis of state-by-state factors leading to the Electoral College selection of every U.S. president since 1980 forecasts that the 2012 winner will be Mitt Romney. The key is the economy, say political science professors Kenneth Bickers of CU-Boulder and Michael Berry of CU Denver. Their prediction model stresses economic data from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, including both state and national unemployment figures as well as changes in real per capita income, among other factors. Based on our forecasting model, it becomes clear that the president is in electoral trouble, said Bickers, also director of the CU in DC Internship Program. According to their analysis, President Barack Obama will win 218 votes in the Electoral College, short of the 270 he needs. And though they chiefly focus on the Electoral College, the political scientists predict Romney will win 52.9 percent of the popular vote to Obamas 47.1 percent, when considering only the two major political parties. For the last eight presidential elections, this model has correctly predicted the winner, said Berry.The economy has seen some improvement since President Obama took office. What remains to be seen is whether voters will consider the economy in relative or absolute terms. If its the former, the president may receive credit for the economys trajectory and win a second term. In the latter case, Romney should pick up a number of states Obama won in 2008. Their model correctly predicted all elections since 1980, including two years when independent candidates ran strongly, 1980 and 1992. It also correctly predicted the outcome in 2000, when Al Gore received the most popular vote but George W. Bush won the election. The study will be published this month in PS: Political Science & Politics, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Political Science Association. It will be among about a dozen election prediction models, but one of only two to focus on the Electoral College. While many forecast models are based on the popular vote, the Electoral College model developed by Bickers and Berry is the only one of its type to include more than one state-level measure of economic conditions.&&&1

I tried to help her about a year ago, and I criticized her for not being responsive, something which many people have commented about. Anyways, she made up a bunch of crap about me being physical threat because she knows that's all the cops care about. I got arrested, people were after me, I left Hawaii, etc. She's had a year to put things straight, and has done absolutely nothing. Now it's gotten to the point where many others are being affected, because they believe, and I cannot help them. She's been getting tons of praise and accolades. She is completely undeserving of any of them. She has shamelessly abused the trust that the people placed in her. Now she should go get a real job.&&&45

Rail support sidetracked at meeting - News&&&The studies show that cities with large, well-established rail systems have significantly higher per capita transit ridership, lower average per capita vehicle ownership and annual mileage, less traffic congestion, lower traffic death rates, lower consumer expenditures on transportation, and higher transit service cost recovery than otherwise comparable cities with less or no rail transit service. This indicates that rail transit systems provide economic, social and environmental benefits, and these benefits tend to increase as a system expands and matures. This report discusses best practices for evaluating transit benefits. We need rail and have needed it for quite some time, instead of forcing everyone to have to drive their cars wherever they want to go.&&&39

Five percent (5%) prefer some other candidate, and five percent (5%) are undecided. Following Romneys overseas trip, 44% believe the president is better able to deal with Americas allies. Another 44% say Romney is better for that task. Republicans continue to follow the election more closely than Democrats or unaffiliated voters. This is a key indicator of potential turnout. Matchup results are updated daily at 9:30 a.m. Eastern (sign up for free daily e-mail update). See tracking history. New polling shows Romney leading by five in North Carolina. The Tar Heel State is rated Leans Romney in the Rasmussen Reports Electoral College Projections. In his weekly newspaper column, Scott Rasmussen notes that Americans have come to view the government as a burden that is weighing down the economy and the nation... Too many politicians, from both political parties, believe the governments job is to run the country. A healthier view is to recognize that our government was designed to play a support role rather than take the lead. In his book, In Search of Self-Governance, Scott wrote that the American people do not want to be governed from the left, the right, or the center. They want to govern themselves.&&&4

I was having serious relationship problems with my husband&&&I was having serious relationship problems with my husband and it had resulted in him moving out.Everything got worse,he started going to strip clubs frequently,getting drunk and passing out..Sometimes when we talked on phone,he would threaten me,he was just not himself and our children were suffering for all the drama. I really love him and we had been married for 15yrs which gave us three beautiful daughters..I had also lost a lot of money on therapists and spell-casters..I was in debt and I felt my world crumbling..I was introduced to a spell caster by a friend who he helped with the same thing and I thought it was just a scam all over again but this time it was different..I did all he asked me to and after a few days,he started getting better,he started calling,texting,things just changed between us,emotions,our love.He has a job and has been sober since and am also out of debt..Its a miracle I never believed was possible,I had lost all hope until I found him..He works and if you have the same problem I did,he is the solution: templeoflove1@gmail.com&&&7
I miss Hawaii!&&&Don't know what it is exactly, but moving back to the mainland has been quite depressing for some reason. I lived in Hawaii for a few years due to military obligations and recently separated and came back home on the mainland and boy do I miss my ohana on Oahu. I love the fact that everywhere you go, no matter what time of day, there's always something to do. I can go outside an enjoy the nice weather, and have a beer with some friends without any worry in the world. I love the people, and how you get treated like family everywhere you go, McDonalds, Burger King, etc...the beautiful views and the year round access to the beaches...don't know if anyone has experienced what I have but. Every time I see something that references Hawaii I get kind of depressed..I can't help the fact that everywhere that's reference on television, for example House Hunters on HGTV, a couple was looking for a home in Waipio, Aiea, and Honolulu, it really made me miss these places...if it weren't for the fact that my family lives on the mainland, I would have no hesitation to live on island. It also won't be the same watching Hawaii 5-0 without being in Hawaii, it's much more fun being able to reference places while there for some odd reason...I'm sure I'll get over it as time passes but has anyone every felt this way or is it just me? Planning to visit in a couple of years and hope it is as beautiful as ever.&&&5

The photos of long lines and traffic jams reveal the extent of the restaurant's support--for some it's about traditional values and for others it's about freedom of religious exercise and speech in the face of government intimidation.

Mayoral debate&&&WOW, how's Cayetano closing statement? He basically called Caldwell the union's puppet and a member of the ole boy network...a vote for him is a vote for the same ole same ole status quo, corrupt taxmongering do nothing regime. Cayetano claims he's tough enough to stand up to "the big boys"....he say he's stood up to the unions in the past and he's not afraid to do it again. He claims he's going to give power back to the people instead of continuing to allow power to remain in the hands of the corrupt who have run this state for decades. WOW ..He sounds more like a Republican than a Democrat to me.&&&33

What Hawaii is really like.&&&Hawaii is like 20 years behind the rest of the world. The state is said to be the most racist of the 50 states and also the most undereducated. A recent study by the Hawaii Literacy Organization reveals that 1 in 4 local adults are functionally illiterate. You can bet that most of the uneducated people in Hawaii are racist and don't like an light skinned or black people. Education in Hawaii is horrible and even UH ranks third tier at best by . Fiber optic lines are not available to the general public as they are in the mainland. The level of awareness is very low among its people when it comes to social awareness and current events. It's dreamland in Hawaii, everyone is asleep. Its expensive and jobs don't pay nearly what major cities do in the states. There is no latinos or blacks, the diversity is mostly Asian who are not even true Hawaiian but will act like it because most mainlanders will assume they are Hawaiian. Tourists don't count either for diversity so don't even try to say they make up part of it because they don't. Nightlife is overrated, there is only a few select clubs and there music is wack. Beaches are overcrowded and hard to catch waves without getting in someone's way. Islanders will try to stare random people down for no reason. They try to act like the west coast gangsters in LA. Asian people that live here will try to talk about you in front of you in another language. Especially Tagalog. So learn some to protect yourself. Hawaii is a place to vacation or retire. That's it. They will tell you that if you don't like it leave which is a great example of how territorial the local asian boys who are not even Hawaiian really are.&&&222
Carlisle: Honolulu council likely to override beach ban veto&&&Maybe Carlisle knows that Tulsi Gabbard is a member of a weird cult who recruit at Kailua Beach Park. She is a life-long member of Science of Identity who's recruiting is considered sinister. Just google Tulsi Gabbard Chris Butler&&&13
Beware of a Honeywell door to door salesperson&&&There is a tall slender caucasian male in his 20's with light brownish hair that is going around offering free home security systems for your home. In exchange, he puts a sign up in your yard to advertise his services. He dropped the Honeywell name so at first I thought he was legit. Then he started asking weird questions like who was home, which neighbors are home during the day, and if I had any pets/dogs. When he left my house, I noticed that he was going up and down my street soliciting to my neighbors. I called the Honeywell office and the girl I spoke to said they don't have a door to door saleperson. She also told me that he was in Mililani Mauka last month, then later in Kapolei Knolls. He then was in Makakilo and now in Kunia. Please be aware and spread the word. He's clean cut looking and was wearing a polo shirt and slacks. He also had a briefcase and cell phone. He asked if we had a security system and who was home during the day. He also asked about my neighbors as well. Be careful, don't reveal any info to him and please alert your neighbors and friends about this. And if he does come to your door call the police. Google "honeywell scam" and you'll see that this scam is also being used in the mainland also.&&&51

Governor to hold 'talk story' on Turtle Bay purchase&&&Transit it will only take 840 cars off the road per hour in 2030. This is less than 5% of the cars. So what would the congestion be like with HOT lanes? I think they could handle more than 840 cars per hour. More importantly they would get the cars off the surface streets faster which is where alot of the time is lost. Toyota is looking to make more hybrid and electric cars in the future. Other companies will follow. Subsidize the cost of these with the tax increases so everybody can go green, even when they drive in the country.&&&29

Hawaii private schools raising tuition fees&&&What a another tuition hike? Why? and what for? The private schools in Hawaii are also behind the national standards. I remember when my child attended a private school in HI (our child was doing well, so we thought). We had our child transfer to a private school in OK due to military, however, our child had to play "catch up" as our child was a little behind. The school tuition is also cheaper and from what we were told, the school our family attends is a prestigious one. Our child is doing well and is now on the Honor Roll!&&&231

Really, its OK, I will tell her what to do after she gets elected and shell obey every command from her Jagad Guru because shes been brainwashed since childhood (she even drinks my footbath water). Trust me, it will be a lot more efficient because I have my own agenda and will never need to bother you for your input. It was nice for you voters to give me seats in the Hawaii senate and the Honolulu City Council, and a congressional seat will be a nice addition to my collection.

Which President is Obama?&&&Though he promised unprecedented transparency, he has famously spent millions to keep his own early school, travel and passport records forever hidden from the citizens who elected him. Even the supposed birth certificate he presented has been proven by experts to be a photoshopped fraud, which in court would be ruled a crime worthy of impeachment. He just exercised executive privilege ordering his attorney general, Eric Holder, not to obey the congressional demand for thousands of documents related to the Fast and Furious plot, which gave hundreds of weapons to Mexican drug dealers and resulted in the death of a young U.S. Border Patrol agent. In many other ways, instead of being transparent he has become the secretive president. There are actually too many tags and associations, with which history will always label this man, to be detailed here (most know them already), but here is a partial image. Picture him approaching in his jaunty, confident gait, with membership buttons and labels displayed on his lapels and across his chest: The gay president,the abortion president,the same-sex marriage president,the homosexual-military president,the pot president,the illegal-alien president,the anti-security president,the secretive president,the $16 trillion dollar debt president,the Obamacare takeover president,the ACORN corruption president,the anti-Israel pro-Arab president,the anti-Catholic president,the Ground Zero mosque president,the White House Ramadan president,the U.N. gun-control president,the pro-Hamas president and the recently revealed damn flag president(nodding agreement with Michelles murmured but lip-read statement). My question: Comparing Barack Obama to all the above-mentioned presidents and what they stood for and asking ourselves if we can encourage our kids and grandkids to be like him when you grow up should we Americans give him another four years to fundamentally transform the United States of America and the presidency itself?"&&&3
Poll: Obama made country worse&&&Two-thirds of likely voters say President Obama has kept his 2008 campaign promise to change America  but its changed for the worse, according to a sizable majority.

Is guru in that one percent richest in the USA or just another BS birther&&&Guru claims he is in that 1% of the richest people in America. He posted and boasted that he owns several income producing properties in Hawaii. What bothers me is his lack of knowledge when it comes to absentee landlords. Under Hawaii Real estate law a absentee owner must retain a agent here in Hawaii and to manage his property. It does not matter if you have 1 or many you must abide by this law. You must also obtain a gross income license and pay the State of Hawaii 4.5 % of your rental fees. When it comes to Federal taxes you must also pay on any profit generated by this income. We all know what happens if you do not abide by laws on taxes and failure to file income taxes is foolish especially if you are in this 1% richest in the USA. I believe this LA Guru guy is a nusiance that clutters up our forum with anti Obama rehtoric and liar comments on realestate. His useless comments to degrade the BLACK American president birth certificate and ignorance of Hawaii's real estate law tells me this guy is a manic depressed LIAR. What super rich realestate mogul is dumb about Hawaii landowner owner laws, state/federal taxes and has the time to posts 46,000 usless comments? Is he really just another Republican birther LIAR trying to decieve us? Sure looks that way to me.&&&14

CAN YOU SAY CORRUPT DEMOCRAT REGIME???

CONDI&&&ROMNEY NARROWS VP CHOICES; CONDI EMERGES AS FRONTRUNNER Thu Jul 12 2012 19:30:01 ET **Exclusive** Late Thursday evening, Mitt Romney's presidential campaign launched a new fundraising drive,'Meet The VP'-- just as Romney himself has narrowed the field of candidates to a handful, sources reveal. And a surprise name is now near the top of the list: Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice! The timing of the announcement is now set for 'coming weeks'. MORE It was Condi who received two standing ovations at Romney's Utah retreat a few weeks ago, and everyone left with her name on their lips. Rice made an extended argument for American leadership in the world. In recent days, she emailed supporters: "2012 is perhaps a turning point for the United States." "The upcoming elections loom as one of the most important in my lifetime," she warned. "I'm very often asked to speak about our current foreign policy and the challenges that lie before us. However, we, as a country, are not going to be able to address any of those international challenges unless we first get our domestic house in order." Developing..." this is a brilliant choice!&&&5

Obama used I 98 times and me 19 times, according to a transcript of the speech posted by the White House. A videotape of the speech posted on YouTube shows that Obama spoke for about 25-and-a-half minutes. During this speech, Obama used I or me approximately once every 13.09 seconds.&&&23

83% of doctors may quit because of ObamaCare&&&More reasons why it should be repealed and Obama ousted. Eighty-three percent of American physicians have considered leaving their practices over President Barack Obamas health care reform law, according to a survey released by the Doctor Patient Medical Association. The DPMA, a non-partisan association of doctors and patients, surveyed a random selection of 699 doctors nationwide. The survey found that the majority have thought about bailing out of their careers over the legislation, which was upheld last month by the Supreme Court. Even if doctors do not quit their jobs over the ruling, America will face a shortage of at least 90,000 doctors by 2020. The new health care law increases demand for physicians by expanding insurance coverage. This change will exacerbate the current shortage as more Americans live past 65. By 2025 the shortage will balloon to over 130,000, Len Marquez, the director of government relations at the American Association of Medical Colleges, told The Daily Caller.&&&2

I'm sure somebody thought it was a pretty funny joke but we try to convey a lot of important information with these signs, Alaska DOT regional construction engineer Tim Croghan told the station, which is the NBC affiliate in Alaska. The television station reported that the Alaska transportation department does not lock the boxes that contain the controls for its electronic signs. ---------- Click the link to see the sign!&&&7

Five major ObamaCare taxes implemented in 2013&&&More reasons to repeal the fcking thing! Six months from now, in January 2013, five major ObamaCare taxes will come into force: 1. The ObamaCare Medical Device Manufacturing Tax This 2.3 percent tax on medical device makers will raise the price of (for example) every pacemaker, prosthetic limb, stent, and operating table. Can you remind us, Mr. President, how taxing medical devices will reduce the cost of health care? The tax is particularly destructive because it is levied on gross sales and even targets companies who havent turned a profit yet. These are often small, scrappy companies with less than 20 employees who pioneer the next generation of life-prolonging devices. In addition to raising the cost of health care, this $20 billion tax over the next ten years will not help the countrys jobs outlook, as the industry employs nearly 400,000 Americans. Several companies have already responded to the looming tax by cutting research and development budgets and laying off workers. 2. The ObamaCare High Medical Bills Tax This onerous tax provision will hit Americans facing the highest out-of-pocket medical bills. Currently, Americans are allowed to deduct medical expenses on their 1040 form to the extent the costs exceed 7.5 percent of ones adjusted gross income. The new ObamaCare provision will raise that threshold to 10 percent, subjecting patients to a higher tax bill. This tax will hit pre-retirement seniors the hardest. Over the next ten years, affected Americans will pony up a minimum total of $15 billion in taxes thanks to this provision. 3. The ObamaCare Flexible Spending Account Cap The 24 million Americans who have Flexible Spending Accounts will face a new federally imposed $2,500 annual cap. These pre-tax accounts, which currently have no federal limit, are used to purchase everything from contact lenses to childrens braces. With the cost of braces being as high as $7,200, this tax provision will play an unwelcome role in everyday kitchen-table health care decisions. The cap will also affect families with special-needs children, whose tuition can be covered using FSA funds. Special-needs tuition can cost up to $14,000 per child per year. This cruel tax provision will limit the options available to such families, all so that the federal government can squeeze an additional $13 billion out of taxpayer pockets over the next ten years. The targeting of FSAs by President Obama and congressional Democrats is no accident. The progressive left has never been fond of the consumer-driven accounts, which serve as a small roadblock in their long-term drive for a one-size-fits-all government health care bureaucracy. For further proof, note the ObamaCare medicine cabinet tax which since 2011 has barred the 13.5 million Americans with Health Savings Accounts from purchasing over-the-counter medicines with pre-tax funds. 4. The ObamaCare Surtax on Investment Income Under current law, the capital gains tax rate for all Americans rises from 15 to 20 percent in 2013, while the top dividend rate rises from 15 to 39.6 percent. The new ObamaCare surtax takes the top capital gains rate to 23.8 percent and top dividend rate to 43.4 percent. The tax will take a minimum of $123 billion out of taxpayer pockets over the next ten years. And, last but not least... 5. The ObamaCare Medicare Payroll Tax increase This tax soaks employers to the tune of $86 billion over the next ten years. As you can understand, there is a reason why the authors of ObamaCare wrote the law in such a way that the most brutal tax increases take effect conveniently after the 2012 election. Its the same reason President Obama, congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media conveniently neglect to mention these taxes and prefer that you simply move on after the Supreme Court ruling.&&&4

OBAMACARE will COST $15,000/Year for families&&&Jones blasts Supreme Court health care ruling 0 Email Teri Webster's photo Teri Webster Alex Jones Examiner + Subscribe Control freaks are now controlling health care, says radio host Alex Jones. Calling it a sickening joke, Jones boiled over with disgust and anger following the Supreme Courts ruling in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare. Key talking points on Jones Thursday broadcast included:  The Act was written by insurance companies and the banks who own them, for their own financial benefit.  The IRS can enforce the Act with penalties and interest for people who dont buy health insurance. Advertisement Death panels can decide who receives care and who does not. Its written by insurance companies to scam you, period, said Jones. Akin to the banker bailouts, the health care act takes taxpayer money and funnels it into private corporations. Health insurance companies are guaranteed policies through a law that not only compels people to buy insurance but uses government resources to enforce it. One analysis of the health care program found it would cost the average middle class family about $15,000 a year. On the heels of the Supreme Court ruling, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney announced he would attempt to repeal the Act should he become president. Jones said that is unlikely as Romney authored much of what became the template for Obamacare. Romney helped write what became the law, he said. A caller into Jones radio program who identified himself as a medical doctor said he does not understand how the health care act was sanctioned. He characterized it as absolute and total tyranny. Its absolute and total tyranny when you dont even have control over your body anymore; when the government tells you how to live and die, the caller said. Jones called another caller an idiot for supporting the health care act. According to reports Obama hailed the Supreme Courts decision as a way to make people's lives more secure. The ruling affirmed that Congress is within its right to require most Americans to buy health insurance through a tax. "It is a dark day for this country," said Jones.&&&2

Is yourr BALLS missing&&&A true Hawaiian mystery. This is one for McGarret, and his super sleuths team to get to the bottom of this week long mystery. Whatever happened to Joe Balls can only mean his sudden disappearance is connected to something terrible. I am surprised there is hardly any speculation on the Honolulu forum about the disappearance of this infamous uneducated blogger from Waianae. Before his sudden exit Joe Balls would publish some 50 degrading accusation type comments daily. Could this nasty habit of posting racially profiling rants against the locals or maybe his outspoken attacks against politicians that hold high political offices be the cause of his sudden disappearing act? Who knows and really who cares?&&&10

Filipinos changing isle politics' equation&&&Filipinos are a strongly religious people by and large and mainly Catholic at that. The choice of conscious as between McCain and BO may come right down to their respective stances on whether BO favors abortion and what some argue is the taking of innocent life, versus McCain's consistently conservative position on the matter to preserve innocent lives that would be destoryed by abortion. Obama is for abortion. McCain is against abortion. In the voting booth, the Filipinos may think back to their up-bringing and the sacrifices made by their ancestors before them and the struggles it took to get here and their faith in their God and religion that helped them through the tough times. My hunch is that a lot of these citizens will honor their parents and religious upbringing and cast their vote for McCain.&&&147

Hawaii Superferry reprieve being drafted&&&I am in favor of a special session to save the Hawaii Superferry. I feel this special session to help this one company is not to save it because of what it did wrong, but that a special session should correct the interpretation of the Supreme Court (HSC) and the Maui Judge of HRS 343. The improvements made, even though made for the Hawaii Superferry, were, in fact, made. According to the HSC, Judge Cardoza ruled incorrectly in 2005 in not requiring the Environmental Assessment that led the company to build the ship and the harbors to be improved. It seems very clear to me why the company did not want to be required to do it---look at all the divisions that have opened up in our state between our islands over this matter. We should have the right to travel by car throughout our state just as roads on the mainland connect cities and towns there. And now that a company has stepped up to risk capital to provide this service they should be allowed to operate. Their way was paved with the approvals they got from so many federal and state officials. The law must be changed to do what is right. I truly feel the vast majority of Hawaii voters support this. At this point the fairest thing to do is to let market forces determine the companys fate. Let the law be changed to honor the exemption made already.(Im not skilled in law, but simply ...) 343-5 10. The following exemption is otherwise provided: A. All harbor improvements made on Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai for interisland ferry service during 2004-2007 are exempt from environmental assessment and therefore an environmental impact statement, and from all conditions precedent. B. The first inter-island passenger/vehicle ferry company using such improvements shall also be exempt from any condition precedent and any environmental assessment, and therefore exempt from any environmental impact statement in the use of these facilities and in operation within all the waters of the state of Hawaii. C. The first company to operate interisland passenger/vehicle ferry service shall be deemed to be JF Lehman and Company, Hawaii Superferry, and HSF Holding, Inc. D. The first company to operate interisland passenger/vehicle ferry shall conform to any and all operation requirements of the Hawaii Department of Transportation.&&&245

Hawaii real estate market to fall further, expert says - Hawaii...&&&"While many U.S. mainland real estate markets are finally showing signs of recovery, steep drops in the number of Hawaii sales during the second quarter indicate the market has further to fall, according to the head of a national consumer real estate information portal." This is why those writers who do not have experience in real estate may not want to write about real estate. For the Tampa Bay area appraisers are coming back with appraisals that are decreasing by 1 to 1.5% per month. However inventory is shrinking which is a good sign. Hawai'i is similar but as usual some writers feel a lame need to sensationalize data in order to sell ad space. No wonder subscriptions are plummeting.&&&286
Rental Bubble is Bursting in Vegas, Hawaii is Next&&&I've watched over the last couple of years as investors have come into Vegas to buy up foreclosed properties and turn them into rentals.

Because of over buying, the rental inventory has been skyrocketing and over the last several months I have watched as the rental inventory has increased over 30%. I believe that we will see significant price reductions in rentals very soon. Hawaii has had artificial rent prices for quite awhile. But what goes up must come down.&&&74

HAWAII'S REAL ESTATE Market right now...&&&The FOUR PHASES of the RE cycle: HAWAII (6/8/12) 1. Expansion (you are entering this now) 2. Equilibrium 3. Decline 4. Absorption (you are leaving this now) ...buying is USUALLY best in #'s 4-1 ...holding is best in 1-2 ...selling is best in 2 Buying is specific. You can make good deals in any market. Real Estate is an imperfect market. Meaning that one person may not take care of his property, or have other situations or needs to take care of, and if you can buy on GOOD TERMS, and at the right price (you make your money going in, you realize it when you sell), you can do well. Buyers have now lived through all of this, and that will change the mentality of their thinking. Stay one step ahead of that, or several, do your own research, and you will do well. BTW...no more flipping. That is over unless you are a very seasoned investor with cash. We are in uncharted territory for awhile. Buy and hold now. Or sell and move up. Pay attention to everything out there, you will have to dig for your own information. A new economy is coming. It takes about a year to get going, sometimes less, sometimes more. The start of this next cycle will last about 5-7 years. Caveat is everything out there. War, politics, money supply, the FED, overseas, etc. Any one or several can delay this. My advice is to buy if you need to, or if you want to improve your situation. Pay as much cash down as you comfortably can, and take as long of a mortgage as you can. Verify all of your paperwork, and take nothing for granted that is told to you unless you know what you are doing. Trust and Verify at all times. Don't move until you can see it in your mind and have verified everything. Then move fast or you will miss it. Repeat the process. Real Estate is KING. Remember that. It has cycles that you can anticipate and verify. That is your key. It is more important now to get the property than to get your price. Inflation is still out there, and is showing up in various sectors. It won't take off like the late 70's again until wages and jobs go up. Watch and monitor your local economy. Watch the bigs...when they start building that is your signal that the economy is coming back That is happening now. Lock down the lowest interest rates in history and buy good, viable properties then improve them to their highest and best use. Generate cash from them if you can and the property supports that end. Once you have done that on a few properties your won't care about politics anymore, or if Social Security will be around for you. At this point, you will be financially free. Millions are doing it right now. It takes about 5 years to become financially free for most, and then another 10 years before you can retire from it. Some will do far better. Some will fail because they lose control of the situation, and they become "don't-wanters". remember, all real estate is in an imperfect market. You can get great deals anywhere. Take an older run down property with good bones and no real serious problems and make it new again. It takes nothing to paint and landscape and the benefits are enormous. Once you do this you can do it on almost any property. Those that do this will be the next winners. Those that wait will miss out and complain about paying high rents. If you can't manage it alone get 1 or more GOOD partners that are self sufficient. Continue to educate yourself everyday on the economy, real estate, etc, and talk to everybody. Again, do nothing until you can see it for yourself. But you better start now or you WILL miss the next opportunity phase that you are entering right now. Interview your Realtors and get to know them. See everything. Give up weekends are see every open house. A good Realtor is worth their weight in gold! Good luck! Now get started!&&&2

The Wisconsin Recall Stakes A test of whether taxpayers can control the entitlement state. A single election rarely determines a democracy's fate, but some matter more than others. Tuesday's recall election of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is one that matters a great deal because it will test whether taxpayers have any hope of controlling the entitlement state and its dominant special interests. Specifically, we will learn if a politician can dare to cross government unions and survive. Mr. Walker isn't facing this extraordinary midterm challenge because he and a GOP legislature asked public workers to pay 12.6% of their health insurance premiums and put 5.8% of their paychecks toward their pensions. Those are small sums compared to what private employees typically pay. Enlarge Image Associated Press Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker . His political offense was daring to challenge the monopoly sway that public unions have come to hold over modern state government through collective bargaining. Public unions aren't like private unions that negotiate labor terms with a single company or workplace. Public unions have outsize influence because they can often buy the politicians who are supposed to represent taxpayers. The unions effectively sit on both sides of the bargaining table. Thus over time they have been able to extort excessive wages, benefits and pensions, as well as sweetheart contracts like the monopoly provision of health insurance. Their focused special interest trumps the general interest of taxpayers, who are busy making a living and lack the time to focus on politics other than during elections or amid a fiscal crisis. Democratseven liberalsonce understood this danger and opposed collective bargaining for public workers. No less a Democratic hero than Franklin Roosevelt once said that collective bargaining "can not be transplanted into the public service." As recently as the 1970s, Jimmy Carter signed the Civil Service Reform Act, which reduced collective-bargaining rights for federal employees. But as public unions began to dominate the modern labor movement, collective bargaining became a sacrosanct part of the liberal agenda. Mr. Walker and his fellow Republicans challenged that status quo, and the unions have reacted with such vitriol because they realize the threat to their long-unchallenged clout. They're especially incensed that the reforms ended the state's practice of automatically collecting union dues. Now dues are voluntaryand lo, many government workers are finding they don't want to join the union after all. // lot's more for those who dial up this URL //&&&4

For People Who Hate Obama more than they Love America&&&-An-open-letter-to-the-people- who-hate-Obama-more-than-they- love-Americaa more than they love America I meet you all the time. You hate Obama. You hate gay people. You hate black people, immigrants, Muslims, labor unions, women who want the right to make choices concerning their bodies, you hate em all. You hate being called racist. You hate being called a bigot. Maybe if you talked about creating jobs more than you talk about why you hate gay people we wouldn't call you bigots. Maybe if you talked about black people without automatically assuming they are on food stamps while demanding their birth certificates we wouldn't call you racist. You hate socialism and social justice. You hate regulations and taxes and spending and the Government. You hate. You like war. You like torture. You like Jesus. I don't know how in the hell any of that is compatible, but no one ever accused you haters of being over-committed to ideological consistency. You like people who look like you or at least hate most of the things that you hate. You hate everything else. Now, I know you profess to love our country and the founding fathers (unless you are reminded that they believed in the separation of church and state), but I need to remind you that America is NOT what Fox News says it is. America is a melting pot, it always has been. We are a multi-cultural amalgamation of all kinds of people, and yet you still demonize everyone who is not a rich, white, heterosexual christian male or his submissive and obedient wife. You hate liberals, moderates, hell, anyone who disagrees with Conservative dogma as espoused by Fox News and Rush Limbaugh. You hate em. Well, here are the facts, Jack. If you hate the Government then you are unqualified to manage it. If you hate gay people more than you love America than you should take your own advice and get the hell out. There are several countries that are openly hostile to gay people, but they are full of brown people and you don't like them much either from what I understand. It looks like you are screwed, but that's not what I am here to tell you. More rant below the fold ...&&&8

Since April, women have gone from strongly backing Obama to endorsing Romney. In April, Obama held a 49 percent to 43 percent lead among women. That has now flipped to 46 percent backing Romney with 44 percent for Obama, an 8-point switch.&&&22

U.S. Military Course taught Officers 'ISLAM IS THE ENEMY'&&&Hawaii we have jobs for a select few of you. You have shown by your daily bashing of I SLAM you would work for us for free. Pentagon suspended the course in late April when a student objected to the material. The FBI also changed some agent training last year after discovering that it, too, was critical of Islam. The teaching in the military course was counter to repeated assertions by US officials over the past decade that America is at war against Islamic extremists, not the religion itself. "They hate everything you stand for and will never coexist with you, unless you submit," the instructor, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Dooley, said in a presentation last July for the course at Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. The college, for professional military members, teaches mid-level officers and government civilians on subjects related to planning and executing war. Dooley also presumed, for the purposes of his theoretical war plan, that the Geneva conventions that set standards of armed conflict, are "no longer relevant". He adds: "This would leave open the option once again of taking war to a civilian population wherever necessary (the historical precedents of Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki being applicable to the Mecca and Medina destruction decision point)." His war plan suggests possible outcomes such as "Saudi Arabia threatened with starvation ... Islam reduced to cult status". A copy of the presentation was obtained and posted online by 's Danger Room blog. The college did not respond to the Associated Press' requests for copies of the documents, but a Pentagon spokesman authenticated the documents. Dooley still works for the college, but is no longer teaching, said the joint chiefs of staff chairman, General Martin Dempsey. Dooley has refused to comment. A military service record summary provided by army human resources at Fort Knox, Kentucky, shows that Dooley was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon graduation from the US military academy at West Point, New York, in May 1994. He has served tours in Germany, Bosnia, Kuwait and Iraq. He has numerous awards including a Bronze Star medal, the fourth-highest US combat award. In what he termed a model for a campaign to force a transformation of Islam, Dooley called for "a direct ideological and philosophical confrontation with Islam", with the presumption that Islam is an ideology rather than just a religion. He further asserted that Islam has already declared war on the west, and the US specifically. "It is therefore illogical" to continue with the current US strategy, which Dooley said presumes there is a way of finding common ground with Islamic religious leaders, without "waging near total war". The course on Islam had been taught since 2004, but was not part of the required core curriculum. It was offered five times a year, with about 20 students each time. Though Dooley has been teaching at the college since August 2010, it was unclear when he took on that particular class, called Perspectives on Islam and Islamic Radicalism. The joint staff suspended the course after it had received a student complaint, and within days Dempsey ordered all service branches to review their training to ensure other courses do not use anti-Islamic material. On Thursday, Dempsey said the material in the Norfolk course was counter to American "appreciation for religious freedom and cultural awareness". "It was just totally objectionable, against our values, and it wasn't academically sound," Dempsey said. "This wasn't about ... pushing back on liberal thought; this was objectionable, academically irresponsible." In his July 2011 presentation on "counterjihad", Dooley asserted that the rise of what he called a "military Islam/Islamist resurgence" compels the US to consider extreme measures, "unconstrained by fears of political incorrectness".

Dumb Californian Stabbed by Cockfighting Bird&&&man attending an illegal cockfight in California died after being stabbed in the leg by one of the birds, officials have said. The cock had a knife attached to its limb to take part in the gambling fight in Tulare County, central California. Jose Luis Ochoa, 35, was declared dead in hospital where he arrived some two hours after being injured. The coroner's report said he had suffered an accidental "sharp force injury" to his right calf. It was not immediately clear if a delay in seeking medical attention was a factor in the death. "I have never seen this type of incident," Sgt Martin King, who had worked in the sheriff's department for more than two decades, told the Bakersfield Californian on Sunday, when the incident happened. Other dead roosters and materials suggesting cockfighting were found at the location, reports said, but no arrests were made. Mr Ochoa, reportedly a regular participant in organised cockfights, had already been fined for owning or training an animal for fighting, according to court records cited by the newspaper. Though cockfighting is illegal in the US, California is a popular destination state for people involved in the sport as raising the gamecocks, organising matches and attending fights as a spectator are all classified as misdemeanours on the first offence, rather than more serious criminal offences in the state. California fall into the sea already. Such jokesters!&&&7
Signing up for Medicare at 65 not mandatory - Kokua Line&&&Excellent! Have no intention of signing up for any of this freeloading leftist crap at age 65 (next year).

Fact is, one day you'll wake up dead and won't even know it. In the meantime, enjoy each day as a wonderful gift .. which it is. I'm looking forward to maybe living long enough to see this out of control monster of a government collapse into chaos. Give this clown from Kenya who now infests the white house a few more months and the process will greatly accelerate. Wonder what the geezers will do when the government stooges start handing out obama-script instead of actual money? Then too, will the IRS hit them for income tax on the IOUs? Fools and slaves!&&&16

School locker searches useful, if used with caution&&&"While that's possible, there is certainly precedence [sic] for such searches in other school districts ...." The word is precedent, not "precedence." I refer the editors to "Helpful Hints for Student Authors." "67.'Precedents' is the plural of precedent. Although they both are nouns, come from the same root (precede), and are pronounced the same way, precedents is quite different from 'precedence.' Precedence normally refers to having priority in order or importance (as in: doing my Chemistry homework must take precedence, because that is my major). Precedent refers to an event or decision that happened before the present (preceded the current event), and serves as an example or justification (as in: the decisions of the Supreme Court served as precedents for the Appeals Court's decisions). The legal phrase stare decisis, which means 'to stand by decided matters,' is another way of stating the legal doctrine of precedent."&&&165

It made the news. **********Back to Business********** Guru has this larger than life over the top, anti-obama, pro republican online personally so you know he is out with different "girls" every week. He is a "Player". ^^^^^^^^^^ FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY^^^^^^^^^^ Today approximately 11,000 people are living with AIDS in the City of Los Angeles. A total of 28,244 AIDS cases have been reported in the City since the epidemic began. During the year 2005, 555 AIDS cases (487 male, 68 female) were diagnosed in the City of Los Angeles. Estimates suggest that approximately 30,000 people in the City of Los Angeles are living with AIDS or HIV, including people who do not yet know they are infected. The charts included on this page include AIDS cases only, because California HIV statistics are incomplete at this time. The information below offers more details on the epidemic in the City of Los Angeles. The AIDS Coordinators Office is committed to using this information to target HIV/AIDS prevention and care services to the people most in need. Gender Trends in the Los Angeles Epidemic Although women are still a minority of AIDS cases diagnosed, their numbers are rising. While women represented only 5% of the AIDS cases diagnosed in the City of Los Angeles in 1991-92, they accounted for 12% of cases diagnosed in 2005. SOCKS @ B U Guru..........IT REALLY DOES.&&&25

Bed-and-breakfast bill advances in Council - Hawaii News&&&There is an underlying irony to this contentious matter. Regardless of whether or not one supports any modification of the rules regulating transient rentals to tourists, it is indisputable that many hundreds of property owners have been willing to break the law for their own profit. They are "scofflaws," who now boldly attend hearings to influence the legislative process and present themselves as good citizens who are somehow being wronged. The property owners who are already lawbreakers are asking for their current criminal behavior to be legitimized. What confidence can neighbors have that the scofflaws will not violate any new regulations designed to limit additional commercial activities that might appeal to the lawbreakers? How can we trust that expanded transient rentals will be any better monitored than in the past by a government that was unable to investigate and shut down offenders despite daring advertising, promotion, and marketing on the internet. People wishing to live peacefully in their homes in residential neighborhoods deserve that their rights be respected and that scofflaws, interlopers, and profiteers not be rewarded for their astonishing disrespect for civility.&&&72

This would be the first election without a veteran representing a major party in the race since 1944. 2) Both Obama and Romney hail from far-flung family histories. Obama's father was born in Kenya; his mother in Kansas. Romney's father was born in Mexico; his mother in Utah. 3) Both men operate from out-of-the-norm religious backgrounds. Obama, the Christian son of a Muslim father, says that his faith guides his decision-making; Romney is the Mormon son of a Mormon father. Both religious upbringings can elicit prejudice. 4) Both men earned degrees at Harvard University. Romney spent four years among the ivied towers, graduating in 1975 with a joint degree in law and business. Obama spent three years in Cambridge, graduating from Harvard Law School in 1991. 5) Both men worked in the financial sector. In 1983, Obama took a job at Business International Corp., a New York-based multinational business counseling firm, as a researcher in the financial services division. "He wasn't there long  only about a year," NPR's Scott Horsley reported in 2008. "But the job at Business International Corp. provided a crash course in market economics." Both politicians have been heavily funded by Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg reports. Romney migrated from the banks of the Charles River to the banking world of Bain Capital, a private equity firm. "What Bain Capital did  and was among the first, if not the first, to do it  was to look at the operations before buying the company, as well as after," Romney told NPR's Ari Shapiro in 2011, "and try to figure out, how can we make it better and then help the management team to improve the company." 6) Both served, for a time, as advisers to their communities: Obama as a community organizer in Chicago; Romney as a bishop  a spiritual lay leader  in the Boston area. 7) Each man lost his first federal election. Romney lost to incumbent Ted Kennedy in a 1994 Massachusetts senatorial contest; Obama lost to incumbent Bobby Rush in a 2000 Illinois House of Representatives election. 8) Both men have championed comprehensive health care initiatives. Romney, when he was governor of Massachusetts and Obama as president. "Romneycare and Obamacare are essentially the same," Gingrich told ABC News. 9) Both Obama and Romney stay fit, dress sharply and look vaguely out of sync when wearing blue jeans. 10) Both occasionally laugh uncomfortably at their own humor. 11) Both have been known to lapse into song during public speaking. 12) Both are political pragmatists. "This presidential election tells us something unexpected about American politics," writes presidential historian Julian Zelizer on . "For all the talk about polarization and discord in Washington, it appears that both parties will have pragmatic problem-solvers at the top of their tickets." The Party Trumps All Watching the 2012 slates materialize  bringing together two similar political figures  reminds Sabato of certain similarities between the candidates in the election of 2000. George W. Bush and Al Gore "were crown princes who had gotten as far as they did because of their fathers' successes," Sabato says. "So the parallels between Obama and Romney aren't that unusual in American politics." (Which may raise another question about the type of person who runs  and whom we nominate  for president.) On Monday's Morning Edition, NPR will air the first in its series, "Parallel Lives," comparing President Obama and Mitt Romney.&&&3
PROFILE: BARAK OBAMA&&&IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH > READ THE REST OF THE STORY Profile: Barack Obama Mr Obama will attempt to rekindle the enthusiasm that propelled him to victory in 2008 President Barack Obama has so far had a turbulent first term in office, dashing many supporters' hopes that his overwhelming 2008 election would usher in an era of liberalism in US politics. He and his Democratic Party passed important elements of their domestic agenda, such as healthcare reform, in the face of united Republican opposition. He has helped bring the war in Iraq to a close, with the US due to pull out all its forces by the end of 2011, and is poised to begin withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan. And under his orders, US commandos found and killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Born 4 Aug 1961 in Hawaii Studied law at Harvard Worked as a civil rights lawyer in Chicago Served in Illinois state senate 1996-2004 Elected to the US Senate in 2004 Bested Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic presidential nomination Won the 2008 presidential election, defeating Republican Senator John McCain But the Democratic Party suffered historic losses in the mid-term polls in November 2010, with the Republicans emerging more determined than ever to promote their conservative agenda. Now, Republicans have started lining up to challenge the president in the November 2012 election. They are betting that Mr Obama will be unable to inspire the same enthusiasm that carried him to the White House and that independent voters will turn away from his policies amid a still-lagging economy. Oratory, charm, background Barack Hussein Obama made history on 4 November 2008, when he easily defeated Republican rival John McCain to become the first black president of the United States. Aged 47 when he was inaugurated, Mr Obama was also the first urban president since Harry Truman and the first president born in Hawaii. More than a million supporters and fans stood in the freezing cold to see Mr Obama inaugurated And unlike John McCain, George Bush and Bill Clinton, his background was not steeped in the Vietnam War or the cultural conflicts of the 1960s. In the two years after he took office, the Democrats overcame Republicans' united opposition to pass an economic stimulus programme, overhauled the US healthcare system, laid down new rules for Wall Street and the banking industry, and passed other key pieces of Mr Obama's agenda. His international achievements include striking a new nuclear arms treaty with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and overseeing the withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq. Early in his presidency he escalated the US-led war in Afghanistan, and the US has seen a consequent rise in violence there. But Mr Obama pledged to begin bringing US troops home in July 2011. Mr Obama and the Democrats were unable to convert those achievements into electoral success, and in the November 2010 mid-term election, the party lost control of the House of Representatives. International upbringing Mr Obama was born in 1961 and was named for his father, a Kenyan intellectual who met Mr Obama's mother Ann, a white teenager from Kansas, while studying at the University of Hawaii. When Mr Obama was a toddler, his father abandoned the family and the couple divorced. Father and son were to meet only once more, during a brief visit to Hawaii by the elder Barack Obama. The White House released an image of Mr Obama in the situation room as US commandos killed Bin Laden When Mr Obama was six, his mother married an Indonesian man and the family moved to Jakarta. Then known as "Barry", Mr Obama later moved back to Hawaii, where he was raised largely by his grandparents. IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF THE TRUTH THAT IS OK, WE WILL STILL PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO WHINE.&&&1

Plaster the pictures on the TV news and in the newspapers so we can all laugh at and ridicule the punks, in addition to identifying them. 4. Put a camera behing Waianae Hardware store. 5. Don't use the word "ALLEGED" in the news. If they get it on film, you are GUILTY. Man up and punish them immediately. Why should we pay a lawyer?&&&68

Evidently they are blind to the neglect of services for several years. City and County can no longer even pay for burying sewer pipes, they run down sidewalks. Plus the EPA is requiring billions of dollars of sewer repairs as a result of long battle with honorable hanneman. In an announcement a few months ago the new budget cut down on public safety, that is fire, police, lifeguards. Many of our major roads are slightly better than gravel roads. The emergency medical for leeward area is a store front setup in Pearl City. But lets grub out all the trees and pour concrete over the grassy areas and get this train going as it will save Oahu.&&&16

Someone mentioned on another blog that if convicted these so called perps should have their families pay the bill for their time in prison rather than Mr.& Ms. taxpayer.

Inflation rate highest in 25 years hoo.c om/ap/080226/econo my.html......this is CLASSIC stagflation/real estate bottoming(it has a while to run, depending on area. Start doing your research now). When this hits hard, both in terms of inflation, rate hikes, low pricing for distressed sellers who NEED to sell....Even if you buy at the highest interest rates possible(maybe10-2 0% interest rates for first mortgages, do it. Then simply refi out to a low rate loan in a year or two. LOW PRICE REAL ESTATE, LOW MORTGAGE AMOUNT WITH A LOW INTEREST RATE, HIGHLY APPRECIATING PROPERTY WITH GREAT CASH FLOW. Magic.&&&1434

If you own a home&&&***IMPORTANT! If you own a home, Please read this. THIS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY !!!!! The National Association of REALTORS is all over this and working to get it repealed, before it takes effect. But, I am very pleased we aren't the only ones who know about this ploy to steal billions from unsuspecting homeowners. How many REALTORS do you think will vote Democratic in 2012? Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it? That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home,$38,000 ON A MILLION DOLLAR HOME, etc. When did this happen? It's in the health care bill and goes into effect in 2013. Why 2013? Could it be to come to light AFTER the 2012 elections? So, this is "change you can believe in"? Under the new health care bill all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax. If you sell a $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Does this make your November and 2012 vote more important? Oh, you weren't aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren't alone. There are more than a few members of Congress that aren't aware of it either < ... ; I hope you forward this to every single person in your address book.

Evidently he feels that would make him welcome here. What the rail people are counting on by signing as many contracts as fast as they can is that it will cost too much in payoffs to stop it, which should still happen. They need to be checked out. Remember hanneman's campaign worked given %500,000 to write a train newsletter. How many of these are still stealing taxpayer $$$ that we do not know about.

I sat there for awhile, because it's so easy to say, "I want a knew car, a new house, money,etc." My response, "I'm done corrupting my life with drugs and alcohol, I'm done corrupting, my family and selling myself short. I asked for God, to rain down on these islands like Hail, wash away our sins" I asked, this in JESUS CHRIST NAME, OUR GOD. The TRUTH has set me free, an Awakening in ME. With that said, I've been led here to this site, so my question to you is, "How do I go about creating a non profit organization, which raises funds for substance abuse awareness, education, outreach, etc.?"

Speeding violations stir police concern - News&&&Yesterday, A motorcycle passed me on H3, High Handlebars, local male rider, no helmet, swerving in and out of traffic like an idiot at speeds over 100 MPH. Don't you think part of the problem is HPD's targeting of the average citizen and their 10 miles over habit while the speedsters evade all. When we read about this guy I saw yesterday will HPD introduce yet another program to tag more average citizens?&&&276

retirement income&&&60 retirerees in the State are drawing more than $100,000 a month and 40 are former DOE educational officers. This is how it is being done by the DOE. An example. A principal of a small school is placed in a school with a large enrollment and thus draws a higher salary for the last three years. Retirement compensation is based on the highest 3 years of employment, so this principal will draw a salary well above the $100,000 mark. Many teacers also spend their last three years in the central office and thus may not be in the $100,000 mark but gain an appreciable amount in their retirement pay. This payment is for life and you wonder as a tax payer as to why our retirement system is going broke.&&&22

Obama's three lies to AIPAC&&&President Barack Obama addressed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) today, and doubled down on his call for a return to the 1967 lines as the basis for restarting negotiations towards a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Declaring that real friends talk openly and honestly with one another, Obama proceeded to tell three lies about Israel and his administrations policy towards it. 1. Lie #1: President Obamas call for negotiations on the 1967 lines was nothing new and has always been the policy of the United States. There was nothing particularly original in my proposal; this basic framework for negotiations has long been the basis for discussions among the parties, including previous U.S. Administrations. What I did on Thursday was to say publicly what has long been acknowledged privately. In fact, previous administrations have all rejected the 1967 lines as the starting point for negotiations. Obamas predecessors have all acknowledged that Israel would retain some of the territory it gained during the 1967 conflict. What Obama did on Thursdayand again todaywas to deny publicly that which has been acknowledged privately by the Palestinians, and publicly by the U.S., hurting Israels negotiating position badly.&&&42

Hawaii you bought it&&&hook, line and sinker! ".....and I quote: "Arpaio emphasized that the Hawaii Department of Health needs to provide, as part of the full disclosure, evidence regarding the chain of custody of all Obama birth records, including paper, microfilm and electronic records to eliminate the possibility that a forger or forgers may have tampered with the birth records. The sheriff said the president should also authorize Honolulus Kapiolani Hospital, the birth hospital listed on the Obama long-form birth certificate, to release any hospital patient records for Stanley Ann Dunham Obama, his mother, and for the newly born Barack Obama, to provide corroboration for the records held in the Hawaii Department of Health vault. Absent the authentic Hawaii Department of Health 1961 birth records for Barack Obama, there is no other credible proof supporting the idea or belief that President Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, as he and the White House have consistently asserted, Zullo said. In fact, absent the authentication of Hawaii Department of Health 1961 birth records for Barack Obama, there is no other proof he was born anywhere within the United States. In addition, investigators say they have developed credible evidence that President Obamas Selective Service card was a forgery, based on an examination of the postal date stamp on the document. Also, records of Immigration and Naturalization Service cards filled out by passengers arriving on international flights originating outside the United States in the month of August 1961, examined at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., are missing records for the week of President Obamas birth.

Unlike Hawaii 5 O or Magnum PI which are detective type shows that showcased the Islands beautiful scenery. Dog da bounty hunter would be sort of OK to swallow if the Chapmans can remain of the radar of controversy with police arrest,court appearances or lawsuits. His wife Beth could tone down her brash dirty mouth too. Apparently they have a following so even racial slurs did not completely stop their show. The big BUT will be their habit of breaking laws for which they have ties to.&&&89

Hawaii Senate To Honor islam Day&&&muslims Trick Americans As Hawaii islam Day Secretly Marks September 11.. To Honor Obama? Muslims have just tricked the Hawaii Legislature into celebrating Islam on September 11. Hawaii has no Christianity Day, no Judaism Day, and no Buddhism Day--but Hawaiis Democrat Legislatorswith the loud public support of Ron Paul connected Rep Kym Pine (R-Ewa)passed a resolution to create Islam Day. By a 22-3 vote the Hawaii Senate May 7 approved House Concurrent Resolution 100 which designates September 24, 2009 as Islam Day. The State House had quietly approved the measure without dissent March 17. Introduced March 4 as HCR100 by Reps Faye Hanohano (D-Puna), Lyla Berg (D-Hawai`i Ka`i), and Della Au Belatti (D-Makiki) HCR proposed Islam Day to be November 21, 2009, marks the anniversary of the founding of Islam. But that was soon amended to HCR100HD1 which intones,the Prophet Mohammad left his house to migrate to Madinah and reached Quba in the vicinity of Madinah on the 12th day of Rabi ul-Awwal according to the lunar calendar, or September 24th according to the Gregorian calendar, thereby marking the birth of Islam.(Emphasis added) This is false. September 24th is the date of Mohammads arrival in Medina according to the old Julian calendarwhich is 13 days behind the modern Gregorian calendar. The fact that Gregorian is mentioned in the resolution implies that somebody was considering the two calendars. Had the Hawaii legislature intended to mark the Julian date September 24 they would have picked the Gregorian date October 7, 2009 for Islam Day. Had they wished to mark the date celebrated each year by Muslims, that would have been the 12th day of Rabi ul-AwwalMarch 9, 2009. But instead they picked the modern Gregorian date September 24, 2009. This day corresponds to no holiday in the Islamic calendar. But on the Julian calendar it is September 11, 2009.&&&3

Governor heckled over Hawaii Superferry - The Honolulu Advertiser&&&Instead of screaming "the sky is falling!" Mr. Hao should realize that these "deadly pathogens" are quite likely to arrive in HI whether UH brings them in or not. And if they come in on their own, without the lab strains to compare them with and without the research, then there will be hell to pay. Don't think that somehow being on an island is going to protect us. We get people from around the world and some of them arrive sick. HI already has some of the world's most resistant Staph, the dreaded "flesh eating bacteria"; not because UH brought it in but brought by visitors to the islands. And fortunately UH is a leader in research on treating Staph. Hiding one's head under the covers and yelling "Don't bring them in" isn't going to keep diseases away. Research gives us the health we have today. We need to keep it up.&&&34

Pearl Ultra Lounge&&&Pearl UltraRetirementHome is like a retirement home(except they serve booze). You get treated badly and they barely want to serve you but you are paying so they'll cope with your existence. They can't wait for you to die(leave) so they can have someone a bit younger than you so they can torture them too until they die off (or until they run out of money) Pearl is inconveniently outside of Waikiki, caters to the 50+ crowd. It's not a hip bar and it deserves no stars. Management (Daniel) is a balding old guy, much like its clientel. And Kasey is a poor college student bartender wannabe. This bar is set for failure to close. Mark my words. The only reason why it's still running is probably because they are squeezeing insurance money off of the retired residents from the first world war. Pearl UltraRetirementHome is wheelchair accessible.(Wheelchair cost extra $10 on top of the normal cover charge)&&&11

Honolulu Star-Advertiser&&&TRUTH IS For Barack Obama to qualify as a natural born Citizen, it is necessary that both parents must have been U.S. citizens, either native born or naturalized, at the time of his birth. By his own admission, and under the British Nationality Act of 1948, Barack Obama was born a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and from 1963 until at least 1984 was a citizen of the Republic of Kenya. Barack Obama was born with dual US-British citizenship by descent from his Kenyan father and his American mother. Part 2, Section 5(1) of the British Nationality Act of 1948 reads, in part, as follows:Subject to the provisions of this section, a person born after the commencement of this Act (Barack Obama, Jr.) shall be a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by descent if his father (Obama, Sr.) is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies at the time of the birth. Obama lost his dual US-British citizenship on December 12, 1963, the day on which Kenya won its independence from Great Britain. However, Chapter VI, Section 87[3] of the 1963 Kenyan Constitution provided as follows:(1) Every person who, having been born in Kenya, is on 11th December, 1963 a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (Barack Obama, Sr,) shall become a citizen of Kenya on 12th December 1963(2) Every person who, having been born outside Kenya, is on 11th December, 1963 a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (Barack Obama, Jr.) shall, if his father becomes, or would but for his death have become a citizen of Kenya by virtue of subsection (1), become a citizen of Kenya on 12th December, 1963. Obama held dual US-Kenyan citizenship from December 12, 1963 until August 4, 1984, his 23rd birthday. However, he became a Kenyan citizen by birth on August 4, 2010, the day on which Kenya adopted a revised constitution. Chapter 3, Section 14 of the 2010 constitution provides as follows:A person is a citizen by birth if on the day of the persons birth, whether or not the person is born in Kenya, either the mother or father of the person is a citizen (of Kenya). Due to his dual citizenship with the United Kingdom and with Kenya, Barack Obama was born with dual allegiances to foreign nations other than the United States of America.&&&3

Hal Summers - ukelele&&&I recently read online about a well-known ukelele maker and ukelele-guitar teacher in Honolulu named Harold (Hal) Summers, who was very active in the 1920s-30s. Back in the late 1960's, I remember taking guitar lessons from a Hal Summers at his apartment-music studio directly across from Waikiki Beach. He was an elderly portly gentleman who played ukelele while I played guitar. He seemed to have a lot of students. Does anyone remember him? Is he the same Hal Summers as the one back in the 1920s and 30s?&&&2

Rail Rifts&&&On Jan. 26, members of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transit (HART) Finance Committee mostly sat in silence while listening to an earful from Wynnie Joy-Hee of Mililani, who said that she had taken the bus all the way into town at 7am to address the issue of how her tax money is being spent. After calling the board out on issues of secrecy and what she called a lack of ethics, Joy-Hee stood up and pulled out a green cloth shopping bag emblazoned with a HART logo and expressed her distaste at Honolulu rails being marketed as a green project. How green is it? she asked.I bet this bag comes from China! HART Finance Committee chairman Don Horner unsuccessfully tried to tell Joy-Hee that she could not testify, since she didn&#699;t have any comments relating to the meetings agenda (construction change orders). He also repeatedly attempted to cut off the testimony of Tom Coffman, an author and board member of Hawaiis Thousand Friends, which has joined in the federal lawsuit demanding the project be halted until an adequate Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is completed. *******(The city has allotted $1.8 million of taxpayer dollars to pay its legal fees so far.) (SHAME ON THESE THEIVES)!!!!!!!!! In Horners defense, Coffman was well over the two-minute time limit for public testimony; however, the two-minute-rule was not as strictly enforced with any of the other public testifiers. I do not think thats adequate for any meaningful interaction with the public, said Coffman to Horner before concluding his remarks about change orders, delays, cost overruns and the need for more stringent guidelines. A regular testifier at HART meetings, Pearl Johnson of the League of Women Voters, criticized the agencys lack of transparency with regard to how contracts were awarded. Michael Domingo, a member of the construction industry, asked why more local contractors were not sought out and given an opportunity to bid on rail contracts, claiming that few, if any, local contractors even knew what contracts are available or how to bid on them. Board members concurred that the main contractor, Kiewit Infrastructure, is in charge of hiring its own subcontractors for the project. HART interim executive director Toru Hamayasu added thataccording to Federal Transit Authority (FTA) regulationsgeographical preference is prohibited in the contractor selection process. Victoria Cannon, a 23-year Makakilo resident, said the project is not pono and It is ridiculous for us to expect a project of this size to come in on budget. It may have come as a surprise to some, still present when Horner himself commented at HARTs following board of directors meeting, claiming he appreciated critical public testimony.They hold us accountable, and rightly so, he said. &&&12

Initial Public Offering ... and HOW! WOW! Facebook!&&&Facebook IPO Filing Reveals Its Stunning Size: A Private Jet,$1 Billion In Profits, And More We knew Facebook was big -- you don't get to 800 million users without making a few bucks -- but until today, we didn't know just how big. Facebook filed papers for an initial public offering on Wednesday, pulling back the curtains on the inner workings of the world's largest social networking site and opening a new phase in the company's ambitious plan to compile, and make money off of, our personal information. Facebook seeks to raise $5 billion in an IPO that looks likely to be the largest by a web company since Google in 2004 and could place the social network's value as high as $75 billion to $100 billion. The portrait of Facebook that emerges in Facebook's over 150-page S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission is of a mature company -- by Silicon Valley standards -- already enjoying robust revenues thanks to a vast, active userbase churning out data for the site. Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg also enjoys the use of a private plane, the filing revealed, and earned a base salary of $500,000 last year, more than triple the salary of Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin when Google filed for its IPO. Facebook looks more seasoned than many of its Silicon Valley peers had when they announced plans to go public. According to the prospectus it filed with the SEC, Facebook has been profitable for the past three years. The company reported revenues of $3.7 billion last year, an 88 percent increase over the prior year, and earned a $1 billion profit, more than Google's total revenue the year it debuted on public markets. Facebook's income also dwarfs that of other internet companies that recently completed their IPOs. Zynga's profits totaled $90.6 million in 2010, for example, while LinkedIn had barely flirted with profitability when it filed for its IPO and Pandora was still hundreds of millions of dollars short of breaking even. Advertising comprises a full 85 percent of Facebook's revenues, down from 98 percent in 2009. Zynga alone accounts for 12 percent of Facebook's total revenues, as the social gaming company must pay Facebook a cut of purchases made in Zynga's Facebook games. // more to follow //&&&3

Joe Balls and his pathelogical lies and madeup stories&&&Does anyone out there besides myself think that this guy Joe Balls makes up stories to conviently fit the thread he comments on? Heres a guy that brazenly posts comments that he buys food stamps from drug addicts and at the same time claims he has property rentals. He accuses oppositional commenters that question his chronic IGNORANT comments of being just 1 person named Harry. Balls dislikes when people posts under aliases and at the same time is known as Stumpy,Jack Meoff,Obama calls me BWANA,Moosechelle, Harrys bestest friend,Harryluvsmyballs, and many more. Just thinking its time for this guy to get a thread of his own and other commenters letting him know what we think about him. Lets see how many HARRYS are out there.&&&53

Homeless hang in at park - Hawaii News&&&A city ordinance prohibits camping at any park not designated as a campground. The maximum penalty for violating the ordinance is a $500 fine, 30 days in jail or both. A bill pending in the City Council would make it illegal for anyone 18 or older to sleep in Kapiolani Park between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Because the penalty can include jail time, the campers said judges do not allow them to plead guilty without first getting assigned a public defender, which requires them to appear in court more than once. So how are they going to expect the violaters to pay a $500 fine, what incentive do they have to pay a fine, they can stay in jail for 30 days and get 3 meals a day. And the bill making it illegal for 18 years old and older to sleep at Kapiolani park overnite, what about the ones under 18 years old?&&&118

HMSA REFUSES CANCER DRUG TO MY WIFE&&&HMSA today officially informed my wife that they would not cover the use of the cancer drug AVASTIN because it has not been proven effective, however, my wife's physcian, a renowned oncologist, feels it is something that may save her life. I am wondering how it is, that a qualified medical professional in the specific skill that treats my wife's illness believes the drug provides a chance for life, and an insurance company doesn't believe so. HMSA says they had "THEIR" medical doctor review the supporting data provided by our oncologist, and "he" says, "it does not satisfy HMSA's criteria for approval." Well I wonder why??? I seriously doubt if any doctor dependent on HMSA for his livelihood would take an alternative view. My wife is dying, an inch a day, from a devastating disease. Our oncologist tells me this new drug targets the specific type of cancer she has and that "previous use has shown promise." He doesn't offer a guarantee, but from our discussion, I believe he knew before submitting the paperwork that the chances of HMSA approving was slim because of the drug's very highcost. So here I sit, watching my wife die, and I can't help but think if the nearly $500,000 the Chairman of HMSA was paid last year (2010) in bonuses was collected by his company's refusal to treat its client's illnesses. I hope you enjoy your bonus this year Mr. Chairman. I'm sure my wife's premiums helped you "earn" it.&&&5

2012 arrived to Honolulu, Hawaii&&&Editor: Citation:Cayetano considers Honolulu mayoral challenge: The former governor opposes the Citys rail transit project, by: Kevin Dayton, Honolulu Star Advertiser newspaper (Honolulu, Hawaii), Paper Version, Local News, Sunday, 1/1/2012, p. A-1 URL: I read with great interest, former Gov. Ben Cayetanos comments on light rail [in relation to a possible mayoral candidacy this year]. It seems to me that the proposed Oahu light rail system is relatively inflexible. There is no network of light rail fixed guideways, just one long, coastal, high capacity passenger vehicle, linear route (passing by populated valleys serviced by a feeder public bus network). Also, the current Oahu light rail system is dependent on a steady series of land acquisitions along a single corridor (which will take forever to accumulate, even with eminent domain powers of government to condemn private property; easy to delay completion & frustrate the entire system). It seems to me that if we could somehow convert the existing Oahu roadway network (in phases)[from mixed uses (public buses, private passenger vehicles, & cargo), to dedicated BRT/Bus Rapid Transit bus lanes (similar to the former general use roadway Hotel Street bus mall in downtown Honolulu) network, to light rail network], it would be more feasible to wean the public from its dependence on car culture. Along future junctures, you can begin to link up mass transport segments, utilizing a phased, multiple path approach. Consider that the existing Oahu roadway network is a fixed guideway system. We drive internal combustion engine motor vehicles along that fixed guideway network. Similarly, a train travels on railroad tracks along a fixed guideway. With existing articulated buses (which resembles small trains), a public bus network is virtually a light rail system. Over the years, land use politics in Hawaii archipelago government has frustrated repeated attempts to wean the Oahu populace from car culture. Yet, the fuel economy of high density passenger vehicles becomes more appealing with Peak Oil. Liquid transportation fuels are diminishing in availability (at any price, including blood and treasure to wage war to obtain overseas oil colonies). Under the current proposed Oahu linear light rail system, a phased, multiple path approach seems to be a more feasible alternative to implementing a higher density passenger vehicle network goal (with a steady series of increasingly demanding operational objectives). With the explosion of passenger transport technology, tomorrows outlook shows great promise (in a steady series of future technical methods upgrade performance segments). Aloha. Mike Chun&&&2

Liberal collapse is here&&&...is in full swing now all over the world as the as the money dries up and the welfare state collapses. Greece, France, Italy, USA, etc. Riots happening all over the world as the crash begins and the hard working people realize that the gig is up and refuse to pay more taxes for the deadbeats of society who scream and wail when they don't get their welfare fix and realize that they have done nothing in their life and now have to actually work to eat and get by, otherwise they are going to starve. The gravy train has run out you babies. The people are not going to vote more taxes for you and you kind to live in comfort while they toil and work. You can complain and throw tantrums all day long...it isn't going to change. In fact, it is going to get much worse. This is you wake up call.&&&11

Honoring WWII service of Japanese Americans&&&i am proud of what our japanese-americans did for us during WW 2. i had a very close family friend that was assigned to the 442nd and was not only proud but honored to have known him. he unfortunately passed away a few years back but i remember swapping war stories with him back in 2001 when i came back home to the big island for my dad's funeral. although we both fought in very different generations i always was amazed at how combat was like during WW 2 compared to what we go through today. when i do fly back home next year i do plan on visiting the history and learning center. also as a side note, i did google my hanai uncle's name (btw his name was Tadasu Muraoka and was a private during WW2) and came up with this webiste hit that lists not only every person assigned to the 442nd, but also the medals won and here's that link: i hope everyone gets to at least take a look at that link and to also thank them for their unquestionable sacrifice for not only Hawaii but also America.&&&16

After you fumble through all the restrictions, advanced booking requirements, eligible dates, blackout periods, one-year expiration date and lack of significant cost savings, you have to wonder if Mark did this just to placate the petitions by the Kamaaina peasants who can no longer afford to fly between the islands, or if Mark (& his management team) truly have their head up their okoles. Time to shift gears and petition Southwest Airlines and ask them if they would enter the market to bring truly affordable airfares back to Hawaii's residents!&&&5

Na Koa Hires Local Boy As New Skipper&&&Na Koa Ikaika Maui Sagara back with Na Koa as manager December 3, 2011 By ROBERT COLLIAS - Staff Writer (rcollias@mauinews.com), The Maui News Save | WAILEA - Brendan Sagara has been waiting for this opportunity all of his life. The veteran independent-league pitching coach was named the third manager in Na Koa Ikaika Maui's two-year-plus history during a news conference at the Fairmont Kea Lani Maui on Friday. The 36-year-old graduate of Leilehua High School and the University of Hawaii-Hilo has been a finalist for "seven or eight" managerial jobs in the last couple of years, but couldn't pass on the opportunity to be the skipper of the only professional baseball team in his home state. Sagara was Na Koa's pitching coach under Cory Snyder in the team's inaugural season of 2010. He guided a staff that had the Golden Baseball League's top ERA, with the league's individual leader and runner-up - Wes Etheridge, who signed with the Toronto Blue Jays organization, and Donald Brandt. Maui has played in two leagues, and had two ownership groups, the latter of which is down to only Bob Young after he was part of a trio of owners to start 2011. Na Koa averaged only 320 fans at Maehara Stadium last year and did not play their final 27 scheduled games - the final week of the North American League schedule was wiped out for financial reasons. "Like anybody else, I was concerned about a few things," said Sagara, who is succeeding Garry Templeton. "I was talking to Dan (Partney, Na Koa's general manager) for a couple of months, and it was a couple of months. It took some time to talk things over and make sure that all the T's were crossed and I's were dotted the way they were supposed to be. When I come in now, I have complete faith that things are going to be better and I hope to be a big part of that." Sagara, currently a scout for the Atlanta Braves, has had the same role with the Washington Nationals. "I can't tell you how excited I am," said Partney, who has lived on Maui since 2007. "I have great passion for the game, I have a great passion for Maui and my local neighbors, friends and family. I am the type of guy who listens to what the community wants and the community out there told me - and I went out there and asked them,'What can we do to make this a successful deal?' They all told me,'Make this a community deal,' and that is what I've done. Hiring Brendan is a great start of that." Sagara and Partney said their first goal is to sign as many local players as possible. Sagara said, "In 2010, I think at one point we had 12 of the 22 players on our roster were from Hawaii and it is probably going to be something similar to that." Sagara said his team will be Maui's team. "Playing at Hawaii-Hilo in college we had 'Hawaii' across our chests," he said. "And we will have 'Maui' across our jersey. You have to have pride in that and that has to mean something to you to play here. It is a lot different than playing for a lot of other minor league clubs across the country." Also joining the club as a consultant is Chris Osgood, who has lived on Maui on and off since 1984 and has extensive radio background with the Braves and Houston Astros on the major league level. Osgood praised the changes Young has made. "They have gotten a lot of the wrong people off the bus, a lot of the right people on the bus," Osgood said. * Robert Collias is at rcollias@mauinews.com&&&1

REAL ESTATE Condos&&&Real Estate to start a new uptrend on Oahu "Janis L. Magin Managing Editor of Digital Content - Pacific Business News Eight years ago, Alexander & Baldwin Alexander & Baldwin Latest from The Business Journals Hawaii still core market for Matson after separationA&B, Matson to become separate companiesHawaiian Holdings stock up 8%; DJIA gains 490 points Follow this company was the first developer in Hawaii to get started on a high-rise condominium project just in time to take advantage of an upswing in the residential real estate market. The Hokua project, which A&B developed with The MacNaughton Group and the Kobayashi Group Kobayashi Group Latest from The Business Journals 38 Hawaii residents named Pacific Century FellowsPrice Busters owners expect higher 2011 sales Ala Moana Center tower would take 18 months to build Follow this company , quickly sold out and ended up being the first of nearly a dozen condo towers to sprout up around Honolulu during the last economic boom. Now A&B is announcing plans to develop another condo tower nearby in Kakaako, just as the local economy is starting to recover from a recession and prolonged downturn. Is this a signal that good times are just around the corner for Honolulus real estate market? Maybe. We did feel that coming out of this recent economic downturn that were going to be the first one out of the gate in this next cycle, which we feel is going to be a good cycle for residential real estate on Oahu and in particular for high-rise condos, A&B Land Group President Chris Benjamin said. The 43-story Waihonua at Kewalo tower is planned for a 1.73-acre lot sandwiched between the Hawaiki and Koolani towers that A&B purchased last year. The building will have 345 one-, two- and three-bedroom units that will be priced starting at $400,000,$565,000 and $720,000. There will also be seven penthouse units. The architects are Design Partners Inc. of Honolulu and Pappageorge Haymes of Chicago, with interior design by Honolulu-based Philpotts & Associates. Its being referred to as an upscale project because of the finishes in the units, but not as upscale as the luxury Hokua, whose units are more spacious and have better, unobstructed views of the Pacific Ocean. Benjamin said the project should appeal to a broad market, from first-time buyers to people looking to downsize from single-family homes."&&&1

Full-Blooded Hawaiians - The disappearing race&&&In Korea, Thailand and Vietniem where you find a lot of half-breeds because of U.S. Military presence at one time or another, these group are the most discriminated against because they are half-Korean; half Thai; and half-Vietnamese. I'm sure it occurs in other countries. With that said, you cannot find to many full-blooded hawaiians in the island these days. I wouldn't be surprise that those who want to create their own Hawaiian nation are half-hawaiians. At one time, the majority population in Hawaii was of course full-blooded Hawaiians. Would they discriminate a half-hawaiian /half Chinese; half hawaiian / half filipino; or half hawaiian half haole or hapa haole? Many half or even less hawaiian blood living here have change their first name to a hawaiian name.... are they considered Hawaiian?&&&80

Now that the homosexual political agenda -- to wit: promoting the idea that homosexual practice is perfectly normal to children in tax supported public schools -- is blossoming as never before, the worst of these homosexual degenerates really have convinced themselves they can do ANYTHING and get away with it.

(usually said with the first thing women like to hear, for added effect) And by all means, do NOT have a moment of honesty when she asks the question: "Does this make my hips look big?" It is a trap play you cannot win. You can only throw a Hail Mary pass to try salvaging a respectable losing score. AND NOTE: no matter how true or honest or helpful it may be, never, ever respond by saying, "No, baby. Your ass make your hips look big." Instead, tell her: "The color doesn't highlight your complexion," then hurriedly go to mop the kitchen or put air in her tires. Ironically, in marriage it is the skillful husband who knows how to sacrifice the truth in order to retain his manhood.&&&1

Complaints about Scams in Hawaii are Rising&&&Be careful, if you rent, work or buy things in Hawaii, be sure to review the companies that you are dealing with first. The economy has become so bad, that crooks are coming up with more clever ways to rip you off all of the time. Don't assume everything is 100% bad or good says Bob Jackson who is a local watchdog exposing slumlords ripping off tenants and employers ripping off workers. You must take the 10 minutes out of your busy schedule to research the company that you are doing business with before making a decision. Jackson also mentions that by doing a little research now, it could save you countless hours of aggravation and thousands of dollars in hard earned money or precious property.&&&4

A clip from Rush's show today&&&ENJOY!! "The Democrat Party can't bring anybody along. Government can't bring anybody along. But, you know, I don't disagree with you totally. You are closer to being right than you know when you say that Obama has looked and he has seen the people left behind. That's not what he sees. What he sees is a country of immorality. Obama sees a nation that has not gotten beyond its slavery past. He sees a nation that has not gotten beyond its immorality, its racism, its sexism, its bigotry and homophobia. He looks at this country and he's got a chip on his shoulder. When he goes around the world and apologizes for this country, it's because he thinks this country's guilty, this country needs to be cut down a size or two. This country needs to find out what it's like to be a different country than the rest of the world. He believes this country's greatness has not come from our people; he believes this country's greatness has come from theft. We have stolen oil; we have stolen resources; we have stolen people; we have stolen land; we've stolen everything to be great. None of it was ours. It's about time we paid the price. So he's knocking us down a peg or two. We are gonna find out what it's like to be a victim of the United States. That's what he and his wife view as their mission. Now, you got close to describing it correctly but you got the motivation wrong. I'm glad you called."&&&12

Man shot to death in Waikiki had drugs in his system&&&Kollin Elderts' family has been emboldened by the actions and statements of their attorney, Michael Green. Deedy's lawyer, Brook Hart, has already been critical of Green, and the "people who know" are not making statements to the press. As the investigation goes forward, I'm guessing that things will be revealed that indicate Elderts was "ackin' up" and was high on alcohol or drugs, while Deedy was derelict in his handling of the situation, and let it spin out of control. If that's how it plays out, look for a murder acquittal, with lesser charge of manslaughter, and a civil settlement of less than $1mil. Two lives ruined.&&&1
Hawaii News, Honolulu, Honolulu News, Sports, Editorial, Features, Travel and Business - Honolulu Star-Advertiser - Hawaii Newspaper&&&Meth and Crack are epidemic and could not possibly exist on an island without police and government being involved in the importation. Just like the old days when the cops were harvesting the pot plants and cutting all the tops off and setting them aside for themselves. One way or the other they make sure they get their cut. Everyone on an island knows. The cops all have family here and the word gets around. Everyone knows whats going on. The pot prohibition is just an excuse. We all know pot is harmless and actually a huge benefit to people who need it. when pot is legal, other drugs are not as popular. Crime and violence also drops. Who are the police? What are they doing with their lives? Power and Greed knowonder people call them PIG's. Don't believe what the police tell you. Don't believe government lies. They spread lies and intimidate with propaganda and fear. They come to the table with guns tazer's handcuff's and the threat of prison. Why would you believe anything they have to say. They are ugly ignorant soulless human beings. Don't trust anyone who caries a gun and follows orders.&&&2

In the Afterglow of A.P.E.C.&&&I don't mind that there was a high level meeting held here, but just how did the common citizen benefit from all of these goings-on? If my memory serves me well, then I can recall that it had taken 22 months to plan for this event. 48 security agencies were involved with the security for the event. The military was used to enforce civilian laws--Posse Commitatus violation? The HPD for three years prior to this event asked every consecutive year for 34 new cameras. Only this year did the city council give in to the demand, why? Well it might have had something to do with the Department of Defense, Homeland Security the tourism Bureau and several other state agencies and several private donors who coughed up the money to purchase and to install the 34 new cameras. HPD said that brings them up to 234 cameras total and they can monitor only 50 at any one time. When the summit ended HPD said they will Uninstall some of these new cameras. The city council owes a duty to the public to ask just exactly the features this camera possesses. I think that all of the cameras bought simply because the FED threw money around should be uninstalled and sent back to the Pentagon or wherever they came from. This is arrogance on the part of the city council and the HPD. The HPD is standing at the edge of a very steep cliff doing such things causes the rest of us to begin believing that HPD place itself superior to and separate from the citizens. Well they need to be reminded that they are citizens too. You cannot be allowed to create a backdoor tax increase, which this camera thing is. Someone has to pay for the maintenance of these cameras it is the tax payers who pay the bill.&&&1

Then they were thinking they got away with grazing. Cant stand when I see people do it in bulk food aisle. -Or do the right thing and keep them in the cart and give them to the cashier when they checked out. So how'd they miss it. I can see her being dizzy and needing a quick food fix. But how does that expain the husband? Also, why were they held in the Safeway office for hours before the police showed up? If any of us went to a restaurant and had a meal, then said you were pregnant and dizzy and walked out and forgot to pay the bill - you'd be charged too.&&&13

Police Officers and parking laws&&&I remember this morning passing a local restaurant and noticing that there was a police car and police motorcycle parked directly before the front door of that restaurant. It was striped zone and clearly marked "No Parking" and one side marked "15 minutes". Inside one could clearly see the two officers sitting before their respective plates of what appeared to be the remains of a larger meal. At least one that would have taken more than 15 minutes to have finished. This made me very angry. I wonder if Police officers are citizens or are they something above average citizen?? Do they have to obey the laws that the rest of us have to obey or can they suspend the law whenever they please??? these officers should have been ticketed and given 2nd written reprimands. No doubt, at least I am convinced of it, that if someone were to mention to these officers to re-position their vehicles that they would have been arrested. I am tired of this kind of abuse going on unchecked. How about you? what should one do about this???&&&12

Huzzah for The Herminator!&&&November 8, 2011, 5:47 PM ET Cain Says Alleged Groping Simply Did Not Happen WASHINGTON WIRE HOME PAGE  By Jared A. Favole Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain on Tuesday dismissed accusations that he had groped a woman in 1997, saying the events didnt happen and he would continue his campaign. Mr. Cain, speaking at a press conference in Phoenix, said he doesnt even remember meeting Sharon Bialek, the Chicago woman who made the allegations of groping during a Monday press conference. My first response in my mind, and my reaction was, I dont even know who this woman is, Mr. Cain said when he saw Ms. Bialek speaking Monday in Manhattan. He said he rejects the events Ms. Bialek described. I have never acted inappropriately with anyone, period, Mr. Cain said. He said he wont allow the accusations to derail his campaign It aint going to happen, he said, adding that he is campaigning for the American people, and for their children and their grandchildren. Mr. Cain said he would be willing to undergo a lie-detector test to prove his innocence. Ms. Bialek was the first woman to hold a news conference to detail her accusations against Mr. Cain, who has had to fend off questions since allegations about inappropriate behavior toward women surfaced more than a week ago. Neither Ms. Bialek nor her lawyer, Gloria Allred, returned calls seeking comment.&&&4

Rental housing prices down 8.2 percent.

That's in contrast to the previous two quarters, when occupancy was on the rise or holding steady. RealFacts compared unemployment and vacancy rates and found that they're nearly identical when tracked over a period of time. It's safe to assume that changes in apartment vacancy will occur to the same degree as unemployment, Bridge said.&&&7

Man drowns as lifeguard funds languish&&&"We are continuing to work with the county to provide lifeguard services at this beach as rapidly as possible," she (Ward) said. Harker said he began lobbying for lifeguard services at the park after witnessing the death of Richard McKeon Young of Idaho in rough surf four years ago. He said he has witnessed three deaths in waters off the state beach at Makena and that the latest could have been avoided. "This was a preventable drowning," Harker said. "Lifeguards would have noted dangerous conditions. Lifeguards situated in the area could have responded in minutes to the initial 911 call." How many more death must happen? Obviously, there is a need for life guards here. Find the money somewhere! Do away wait something not need and put the money there. Act now. When a law suit hits, then it would've been better to invest that money in the first place.&&&9

Barack Hussein Obama&&&Well said! Barack Hussein Obama II (born August 4, 1961) is the 44th President of the United States and the controversial recipient of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. Overcoming a short political career, Obama defeated Republican nominee John McCain for the presidency in 2008, campaigning on promises of "hope" and "change". In effect, that change has been an embrace of socialism, Marxism, and liberal policies. Barack Obama has been widely criticized by the American business community and others for his anti-business policies that are killing American jobs during a period of high unemployment.[1] Trend forecaster Gerald Celente indicates that Obama administration's response to the the failed American economy is more war and the creation of misleading economic statistics.[2] Under President Obama's management of the economy, the United States Government's credit rating has, for the first time in it's history, been downgraded from AAA to AA+, and poverty[3] has increased markedly. By and large his policies to combat the recession, unemployment, slow growth, the deficit, and expanding national debt, have failed.[4] Also on the domestic front, Obama passed an expensive health care bill in 2009 with no bipartisan support and 34 Democrats dissenting. In foreign policy Obama has escalated the Afghanistan War and, against his own Defense Secretary's advice, attacked Libya - a possible violation of the War Powers Act. After he announced the killing of September 11th mastermind and terrorist Osama bin Laden, the U.S. State Department warned of the increased risk to the lives and safety of Americans around the world.[5] Bin Laden's death had negligible impact on Obama's approval ratings.&&&32

Obama readies an ugly campaign,&&&P. Noonan (excerpts) People are increasingly fearing the divisions within, even the potential coming apart of, our country. Rich/poor, black/white, young/old, red/blue: The things that divide us are not new, yet there's a sense now that the glue that held us together for more than two centuries has thinned and cracked with age. -- -- But there is a broad fear out there that we are coming apart, or rather living through the moment we'll look back on as the beginning of the Great Coming Apart. Economic crisis, cultural stresses: "Half the country isn't speaking to the other half," a moderate Democrat said the other day. She was referring to liberals of her acquaintance who know little of the South and who don't wish to know of it, who write it off as apart from them, maybe beneath them. -- -- Where is the president in all this? He doesn't seem to be as worried about his country's continuance as his own. He's out campaigning and talking of our problems, but he seems oddly oblivious to or detached from America's deeper fears. And so he feels free to exploit divisions. It's all the rich versus the rest, and there are a lot more of the latter. -- -- Occupy Wall Street makes an economic critique that echoes the president's, though more bluntly: the rich are bad, down with the elites. It's all ad hoc, more poetry slam than platform. Too bad it's not serious in its substance. There's a lot to rebel against, to want to throw off. If they want to make a serious economic and political critique, they should make the one Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner make in "Reckless Endangerment": that real elites in Washington rigged the system for themselves and their friends, became rich and powerful, caused the great catering, and then "slipped quietly from the scene." It is a blow-by-blow recounting of how politiciansDemocrats and Republicanspassed the laws that encouraged the banks to make the loans that would never be repaid, and that would result in your lost job. Specifically it is the story of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage insurers, and how their politically connected CEOs, especially Fannie's Franklin Raines and James Johnson, took actions that tanked the American economy and walked away rich. It began in the early 1990s, in the Clinton administration, and continued under the Bush administration, with the help of an entrenched Congress that wanted only two things: to receive campaign contributions and to be re-elected. The story is a scandal, and the book should be the bible of Occupy Wall Street. -- --&&&1

Cut and run .... and then try to survive the consequences&&&> EditorialsPremium > OUR VIEW End in Iraq puts needed focus on U.S. POSTED: 01:30 a.m. HST, Oct 23, 2011 After nearly nine years of being entrenched in a country that was mistakenly accused of connections with the 9/11 attack on America, virtually all U.S. troops will be withdrawn from Iraq by year's end. At long last, and with profound relief. -- -- -- "I just hope the bad guys don't load up again. As soon as we back off, the insurgents start up again," a soldier at Schofield told the Star-Advertiser. -- -- The Bush administration had attacked Iraq based on terrible intelligence that Iraq somehow was in cahoots with the 9/11 attackers. -- -- -- Hawaii's U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono is right in saying that the lives lost -- and "the $1 trillion that has been added to our national debt -- has been tragic." She also points out that maintaining a strong military able to respond to threats should be combined with "diplomacy to achieve and keep the peace, and oppose ill-considered international military entanglements."&&&14

Maybe even have some young and tender girls younger than 12 to escort them back to their lands to show proper aloha to keep the old fogies company, its just a friendship thing....If we knew that these people were going to create such a security risk then they could have just stayed home and purchased "Go to Meeting. com" then they would have no security problem.

U.S. Nuclear Testing Program in the Marshall Islands During the period from June 30, 1946, to August 18, 1958, the United States conducted 67 nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands, all of which were considered atmospheric. The most powerful of those tests was the "Bravo" shot, a 15 megaton device detonated on March 1, 1954, at Bikini atoll. That test alone was equivalent to 1,000 Hiroshima bombs. While the Bravo test is well known, it should be acknowledged that 17 other tests in the Marshall Islands were in the megaton range and the total yield of the 67 tests was 108 megatons, the equivalent of more than 7,000 Hiroshima bombs. For the sake of comparison, it may be noted that from 1945 to 1988, the U.S. conducted a total of 930 known nuclear tests with a combined yield estimated to be 174 megatons. Approximately 137 megatons of that total was detonated in the atmosphere. In other words, while the number of tests conducted in the Marshall Islands represents only about 14% of all U.S. tests, the yield of the tests in the Marshalls comprised nearly 80% of the atmospheric total detonated by the U.S. Under Article IV of the Section 177 Agreement, The Governments of the United States and the Marshall Islands agreed to the establishment of a Claims Tribunal which would have jurisdiction "to render final determinations of all claims past, present and future, of the Government, citizens and nationals of the Marshall Islands which are based on, arise out of, or are in any way related to the Nuclear Testing Program, and disputes arising from distributions made under Article II and III of this agreement."&&&8

We provide medical and psychological insights with the hope of getting people to conquer their addiction. Our production crew is trained to handle sensitive stories and, of course, each and every story will be treated delicately.

Identity thieves love tourists&&&I just want to say that the lifestyle in Hawaii SUCKS. The reason why there are so many crimes is because the law in Hawaii is WEAK. I've experienced living on O'ahu & I am disappointed to have experienced being around so many arrogant, selfish, uneducated, racist individuals who have the nerve to convey what they call the "Aloha Spirit". It's BULLSHIT. Given the opportunity to live on an island whom many people call "Paradise" is a joke. I think Hawaii could be better if the people & the environment improves. It sucks to think you can walk around Waikiki or anywhere hoping to enjoy the scenery but can't because there are so many drug Crystal Meth using losers walking around town getting high right in front of tourist. It's disgusting. There are so many people in Hawaii who are so rude & unprofessional. The go around telling new residents to "act like your a local" to get accepted. Why do you need to pretend to be something your not? just to get accepted? PIECE OF SHIT. This island sucks. I guarantee that I will never recommend living on the island of O'ahu or even visiting at all. Granted the beaches are beautiful, but what makes it unwelcoming are the locals of Hawaii who are RACIST. FUCK HAWAII. HAWAII SUCKS BRAH!&&&174

Search for bones to affect traffic along rail route&&&Another way of Transportation Dept. to waste taxpayer dollars on this rail fiasco which has not been permitted yet. If by some odd chance the rail project is forced upon Oahu, it would be years before it reaches this area in town. Actually this is where it should be started not out in some farmer's fields. All a part of his "honor's" plan to spend as much of taxpayers $$$ as possible so when it is close to being cancelled he can point out how many millions have already been spent which would have been a waste. Meanwhile there is talk of adding MORE to GET for roads. What happens to the huge amount of dollars we pay in fuel tax, does it also get added to general fund to support the welfare costs (along with sewer fund and hurricane fund)?&&&11
SolyndraGate&&&Hopefully this corruption scandal will lead to Obama's impeachment. Let's keep our fingers crossed!! ... Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that his committee plans to investigate government loan programs to private corporations in light of allegations of improper dealings between the White House and failed energy company Solyndra and wireless start-up LightSquared. "I want to see when the president and his cronies are picking winners and losers it wasn't because there were large contributions given to them," the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee said Tuesday morning on C-SPAN. Issa said the committee was looking at whether it was improper for members of Congress or White House staff to select companies eligible for subsidized government loans when those companies could give campaign donations. Loan programs have been a popular tool to provide funding for popular industries  like tech, green energy, and American auto companies  at more favorable terms than could be secured privately. The Obama administration has been defending itself against criticism by Republicans that it exerted improper influence to the aid of both companies. Solyndra abruptly filed for bankruptcy earlier this month, surprising both employees and the administration, which had secured $535 million in low-interest loans for the company.&&&23

Woman sentenced in child assault - Hawaii News&&&I feel that the sentence that was given to Poouahi was wrong she needs to be locked up for the rest of her life,she needs to endure the same pain that she and her family inflicted upon this child,this little girl will suffer the rest of her life because of what these animals did to her.They are lower than animals and should be put away forever so they can't hurt anyone else. I do not understand why the judge accepted any kind of a plea bargain,the child was unable to be heard when her crys of suffering were ignored by these horrible people,who's child will be next the laws should be changed so this does not happen again. Maybe if this had happened to a law enforcement agent or some well to do person in the public eye more would have been done. I just hope that this family will endure the same pain in there lifetime.Or maybe with any kind of justice the inmates in prison will take care of this parisite and here family that participated in this crime they are lucky it wasn't one of my family.People wonder why familys retaliate against evil people who prey upon children.Law Enforcement wake up!&&&2
HUGE MEDICARE INCREASE&&&MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASE For those of you who are on Medicare, read the following.

These are provisions incorporated in the Obamacare legislation, purposely delayed so as not to 'confuse' the 2012 re-election campaigns. Send this to all seniors that you know, so they will know who's throwing them under the bus. BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA.,Harry Reid,Barbara Boxer, Barney Franks,Maxine Waters,Queen Nancy Pelosi, and the rest of the LIBERAL Democrats ... ...by the way...they are not under the health care package that they passed ..... ...by the way MUSLIMS and Illegals are not subject to OBAMA CARE.....

Honolulu cuts federal fund projections for rail by $300M&&&FACT CHECK  Rail Opponents: City Needs $100M Per Year To Keep Trains Running Honolulu City Government UPDATED 9/22/2011 12:01 a.m. Editor's Note: Four well-known opponents of rail published an opinion piece in the Aug. 21 edition of the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Civil Beat has identified seven claims worthy of a closer look. This is one of those Fact Checks. Perhaps the most common refrain from rail critics is that the proposed technology is more than is needed for our small island, that the $5.3 billion price tag is too high, and, basically, that we can't afford it. In their Aug. 21 op-ed, four well-known opponents made the following statement: Even with such cherry-picking and wildly optimistic forecasting, however, the city reluctantly acknowledges that if rail were to be built, another $100 million would need to be "found" each year, just to keep the trains running. The obvious sources are substantially higher fares for riders and substantially higher taxes for everyone. Loading Asked for support documents, one of the piece's authors, Cliff Slater, provided the following statement to Civil Beat: See DRAFT Financial Plan for Entry into Final Design April 2011, Cash flow attachment. Subsidy for first full year of operation in 2020, less Handi-Van, is $216 million. For 2010 it is $97 million.&&&13

Then you go to all the Korean bars here and there are some women that actually drink while they work too! The liquor commissioner has been seen in the bar too and he doesn't site any business too! If I had his job, the County would have extra spending money from me sighting the clubs and bars. I know that these girls DO NOT pay taxes too, it's all cash paid jobs.&&&32

Slick article about 16 new HPD survelliance cameras&&&I see the news article in the Wednesday September 21, 2011 edition of the Honolulu Star-Advertiser about the debuting of 16 new surveillance cameras, written by Mr. Gordon Y.K. Pang. As I recall this debut of the cameras is the culmination of the H.P.D. having asked for them for over three years. I am not certain why the city council had refused them in the previous years, but this was not noted by Mr. Pang. Also not noted by Mr. Pang was the fact that the money to purchase them was provided by the State tourism bureau, the Department of Homeland security, and a handful of other unnamed state agencies and departments. The HPD asked for 34 and got 34 new cameras. The article by Mr. Pang says there are only 16. Not so, there are a total of 34. This is a carefully engineered backdoor tax increase to filter through to the police department. We were told in previous how much the visiting APEC delegates and their minions will benefit the economy. They should run the story with the fact that these people will be carrying cards supplied usually to diplomats that excuses them from paying taxes on all their purchases. Since 1989 these world leaders come together and discuss these non-binding issues and simply have a very fancy picnic. So, as nearly as I can recall, that makes 2,021 people who will coming here and not paying taxes on all that they purchase....how does that benefit again?????&&&7

For example, last year’s dredging stopped at the Ala Moana Bridge. A larger-walled Canal, carrying more water, will damage the marina. The boats in the marina take the brunt of the damage. In the last ten years, during heavy rains, boats were carried away.” Changing the subject slightly, does someone knows when and why DLNR, Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation (DoBOR) is responsible to cleaning all the debris that Ala Wai Canal brings to Ala Wai Small Boat Harbor?&&&5

UH football&&&Pollard should be penciled out of the UH football lineup. He had a good gain runnibg into traffic so he should have played safe, tuck in the ball and went down on the five yard line. If he was on the side lines he could have made a bold attempt at the end zone because out of bounce would protect him from fumbling the ball. Second misplay. Dropping a well thrown ball in midfield by Moniz. Third misplay. The long pass should have been read as short because the defender was back of him but pollard never looked back and did not know where the ball was. Fourth misplay. When Moniz was scrambking, Pollard instead of running in the back of the end zone should have helped Moniz by running towards Moniz.&&&11

Zippys Japanese section in Kahala&&&Zippys Japanese section in Kahala is not serving a menu that suits the taste of Hawaii residents. As a result, the place is usually empty.&&&27
Appointed school board&&&Our appointed school board is ineffective because our Dept. of Education is an ineffective Government agency. The way it operates is not conducive to serve the children of Hawaii. It is more concerned with payrolls of the Beaucrats and handing out choice contracts to friends and relatives. Money not well spent is government tax dollars wasted. We are now broke and there is no relief in sight. Our appointed school board is again on the path of closing more schools.&&&21
Hawaiian, Korean Air team up - Business&&&While flying from Seoul to Honolulu this past February we were treated to friendly and generous service by our KAL Flight attendents. They wished us well as we disembarked and looked as radiant and fresh as they did throughout the flight. When we got on to our connecting Hawaiian Air flight to our home island we were met at the entry way by surley and grumpy flight attendant. What an eye-opening and very noticeable observation in contrasting "friendliness". Maybe they're overworked and underpaid but We hope Hawaiian Air polices their flight attendants for the better.&&&17

Obamanomics: ZERO jobs added in August&&&Obama = FAILURE Employers added no jobs in August - an alarming setback for the economy that renewed fears of another recession and raised pressure on Washington to end the hiring standstill. Worries flared Friday after the release of the worst jobs report since September 2010. Total payrolls were unchanged, the first time since 1945 that the government reported a net job change of zero. The unemployment rate stayed at 9.1 percent. The dismal news two day before Labor Day sent stocks plunging. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 253 points, more than 2 percent. Analysts say the economy cannot continue to expand unless hiring picks up. In the first six months of 2011, growth was measured at an annual rate of 0.7 percent. Companies are mostly keeping their payrolls intact. They're not laying off many workers. But they're not hiring, either. Without more jobs to fuel consumer spending, economists say another recession would be inevitable. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic growth.&&&22
Man shot down, witnesses say&&&I'm sure you read , but it was about a woman. Tempers can flare up , when so many people are feeling the new cost of rents and housing, this might add to alot more crime. So many people seem hopeless and desperate there , with the recent real estate boom and affordability . More people homeless and more problems. It seems to always go that way on the mainland, but maybe Hawaii is different ???&&&3

New data posted Sunday shows that 39% of Americans approve of Obama's job performance, while 54% disapprove. Both are the worst numbers of his presidency.&&&39

Honolulu Police ask for more surveillance cameras&&&Just at the time that the governor's hard work to balance the budget has been rewarded the feeding frenzy begins. The police department is in its third or fourth year of asking the city counsel for extra surveillance cameras. I don't know what how successful this bid will be. But it seems to me that the nerve they have in asking for this is tantamount to a back door tax increase. They want to install the cameras for the safety of the APEC attendees. These APEC attendees should have to cough up the money for the cameras and then uninstall them after they leave and they should be made to pay for that too. None of the rascals in the government can see that we are tired of spending money unnecessarily.&&&12

Makaha Victim's Family Angered By Suspect's Release&&&First of all my deep condolences the Willingham family. I really think they have a strong point here regardless of the suspect clean criminal record, It is fact he did try to flee the scene and had to be forcefully held, by two Good samaritans until police came. That in itself, seems reasonable that the suspect would be a flight risk or at least run from the Police, when they get a warrant for him. Why no bail? complex case, my you know what! this idiot try driving away with a torn body sticking out his front windsheild, and then took off on foot! What an A#$.. maybe HPD/Prosecuters should fix this..because dont look good ehh.&&&17

BirtherGate is still alive and kicking!&&&Just How Far Will the Hawaii Department of Health Go to Cover for Obamaand Themselves? On July 23, 2011, The Post & Email mailed a request to Loretta Fuddy, Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, under the states open records, or UIPA, law. Our request was received by the Hawaii Department of Health on July 28, 2011 and responded to on August 3, 2011 as having been denied in its entirety. The reason for the denial given was Director Fuddys personal calendar is not a government record within the scope of HRS 92F-3, See OIP Opinion 04-17. The calendar was sought because a member of the public had been told that Fuddy was on leave and had left the island when calling to inquire as to whether or not Fuddy intended to comply with a subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court in Honolulu in relation to the lawsuit Taitz v. Astrue. The Post & Email was told by an Oahu resident acquainted with certain employees in the Health Department that Fuddy had been gone for a few days but had been in her office during the weeks of July 18 and July 25, 2011.&&&50

They would be able to stop the crime before it happened, cameras MAY identify criminals but so far are not enough in Hawaii for an arrest warrant. However, this quote from the story makes this camera idea even stupider. "The cameras would record video not audio. HPD staff won't monitor them 24/7, in fact they can only watch 50 out of the more than 250 cameras at one time."&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&While Sandy Arterburn from Hawaii Kai defends BB's I have a different take. I purchased a single family home 25 years ago in Kailua. Where I grew up. I selected this home because the area was quiet and peaceful. Five years ago, a home up the street was sold to a young couple from the mainland who probably could not afford the rent. They immediately began renting rooms to outsiders (young single people from the mainland) who drive BMW's and love to go fast. Our tranquil street today resembles a racetrack while young children play close to the edge. In my opinion, no one should ave the right to alter the ambiance of an entire neighborhood for their own benefit and we need laws to protect us from the homeowner who displays little common sense in this matter. Without the laws, Kailua's neighborhoods have become a zoo while hotel occupancy is at an all time low.&&&13

Hawaii real estate suit filed over noisy frog - The Honolulu Ad...&&&this is ridiculous. the coqui frogs have in Wainaku, and many other places on the Big Island for a long time; this is a typical frivilous lawsuit from people who buy a $2 million dollarpiece of property, sight unseen, and then complain about the local conditions. Moran clearly states that the coqui frogs were signed off on addendums and contracts and that he therefore did not misrepresent the property. The frogs can be controlled with citric acid; but i guess this is too much work for people who want to buy a piece of paradise turnkey!&&&160

Honolulu wages higher for construction, transportation&&&That's because they're mostly union jobs and the union base their wages on the cost of living times 1000 (or some ridiculous number) and since the cost of living here is outrageously expensive naturally their wages would be higher.

The problem with alcoholics and/or drunk drivers is that they don't know how to stay off the roads when they drink. My friend's late alcoholic husband used to drive to buy more liquor because no one would get it for him. She couldn't stop him and would pray that he didn't kill someone.&&&49

Fireworks injuries fly higher - Hawaii News&&&A total ban IS possible, and has been implemented in many large cities throughout the world, even in Asia, were the cultural tradition is much, much older than in Hawaii. The illegal fireworks are smuggled in with the legal ones, then people have been modifying both types to make homemade bombs. This is a federal offense, and is completely insane and has to stop. Along with the neighborhood terrorists inflicting harm on others and their property there will soon be real, full-fledged terrorists who realize that Hawaii provides the perfect combination of abundant explosives and high-profile targets. It's totally out of control when my house, which is built like a tank, shook more on New Year's Eve than in the last two earthquakes because of the bombs going off all night. I know that in many areas the bombs have been going off since October, and are STILL going off. Sorry, that is NOT a tradition--that's terroristic threatening. OUr legislators have to be step up to the plate and put public safety ahead of the concerns of the people whose selfish behavior is inflicting harm on innocent people and animals.&&&33
Let's Fix Congress&&&Please consider, if you agree, sending the following message to as many people that you can vial e-mail. The 26th amendment (granting the right to vote for 18 year-olds) took only 3 months & 8 days to be ratified! Why? Simple! The people demanded it. That was in 1971...before computers, before e-mail, before cell phones, etc. Of the 27 amendments to the Constitution, seven (7) took 1 year or less to become the law of the land...all because of public pressure. I'm asking each addressee to forward this email to a minimum of twenty people on their address list; in turn ask each of those to do likewise. In three days, most people in The United States of America will have the message. This is one idea that really should be passed around. Congressional Reform Act of 2011 1. Term Limits. 12 years only, one of the possible options below. A. Two Six-year Senate terms B. Six Two-year House terms C. One Six-year Senate term and three Two-Year House terms 2. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they are out of office. 3. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. 4. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do. 5. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%. 6. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people. 7. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people. 8. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void effective 1/1/12. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen. Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work. If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it will only take three days for most people (in the U.S.) to receive the message. Maybe it is time. LET'S FIX CONGRESS!!!!! If you agree, pass it on. If not, just ignore. Please keep it going .&&&2
Bar backs legal aid rule shift&&&The courts belong to the people not the attorney's. The people should have complete and total access with or without an attorney. What good is a court if you can only use it with a lawyer. Who can afford an attorney. Ever try to get an attorney without a $5,000 retainer. You do not need an attorney to get justice. You need a judge. Citizens pay for the courts, we own them. Citizens should have unbridled access to all courts in the State of Hawaii. Too many attorney's not enough justice.&&&4
poor customer service at waikele sports authority&&&My family and I spent almost $200 worth in items at Sports Authority. The sales clerk did not greet us with a smile or a hello. During the entire transaction, the salesclerk did not once smile. At the end of the transaction, she thanked us looking in another direction without a smile (no eye contact). It pisses me off when I receive poor customer service. I deal with customers on a daily basis and I do not show my customers if I am having a bad day.

Illegal Homeless Camps a Growing Problem&&&I have an idea, lets shut down Ala Moana Beach Park and force the homeless people to Waianae coast. Lets do it without coordinating anything with the state. We need to keep our friends at Hokua happy, since they contributed to my many losing campaigns in the past. What was Mufi thinking? Did he think the homeless people would disappear? Well, I guess as long as his friends are comfortable in their fancy condos, then the problem will just go away. Props to councilman Apo, I hope his protest is a success. If anyone has details on how to help organizing please post here.&&&24

Obama care a joke&&&New Word For The Day - "Dhimmitude" What Does It Mean? Obama used it in the health care bill. Now isn't this interesting? It was used in the health care law. Every day there's another revelation of what Obama is doing to our country. Dhimmitude -- I had never heard the word until now. Type it into Google and start reading. Pretty interesting. It's on page 107 of the healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and yep, it exists. It is a REAL word. Word of the Day: Dhimmitude Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad. Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam. Obama Care allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States . Folks, this is exclusively an Islamic concept under Sharia Law. So exclusive they had to make up an English word to define the concept. Why would our government start interjecting Sharia Law concepts into new broad and sweeping legislation like health care that would control the US population?....Anyone? Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be "gambling", "risk-taking", and "usury" and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this. How convenient. So a Christian would have crippling IRS liens placed against all of their assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivables, and will face hard prison time because they refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan and all other US Muslims will have no such penalty and will have 100% of their health needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Sharia Law definition of... Dhimmitude. This is not a Western Civilization concept. Dhimmit has two purposes: To enrich Muslims AND to drive conversions to Islam. I recommend sending this post to your contacts. This is desperately important and people need to know about it -- quickly! This really is happening in our country. A fraction at a time. Wake up America ! They're coming in the back door.&&&1

One for the stupid criminals TV show&&&It was just before 3 a.m. Wednesday when an alert neighbor saw what appeared to be a burglary in progress on Lusitana Street and called police. When officers arrived they found the home was tented for fumigation and then spotted a man trying to flee from the property. 21-year old James Tolentino Malgana was arrested on suspicion of burglary. His partner refused repeated commands to come out. The fumigation company was notified. A crew from Diversified Exterminators opened the tent to air out the home. Officers entered the home more than three hours later at about 6:15 and found the suspect hiding in a bedroom. 25-year-old Joshua Yoshimura was arrested on suspicion of burglary. Police charged both suspects with burglary in the first degree. Malgana's bail is set at $11,000, and Yoshimura's bail is $20,000. The prosecutor's office says no court date has been set for the men yet.&&&7

Gas prices in Honolulu are about 63 cents higher than last year, but still far below the record of $4.48 cents a gallon on May 6. The statewide average price of regular gas is about $4.12 a gallon, up 2 cents from yesterday and seven cents higher than last month. Pump prices continue to climb across the country even though demand has been anemic for July, which typically is one of the heaviest driving periods as Americans travel on vacation.&&&1
Subpoena filed&&&Impeachment on the way...you will have a big day on August 8 Hawaii... "WND Exclusive CERTIFIGATE The birth certificate please! Subpoena to be delivered Attorney, doc experts to show up at Hawaii Department of Health with court document Posted: July 28, 2011 11:15 pm Eastern By Jerome R. Corsi  2011 WND President Barack Obama in the Oval Office April 4. Computer scanning expert Doug Vogt and typesetting expert Paul Irey say they will accompany attorney Orly Taitz when she presents to the Hawaii Department of Health a subpoena that should allow her to examine Barack Obama's original 1961 typewritten birth certificate. Vogt and Irey both told WND they are making travel plans to join Taitz in Honolulu when she goes to the state agency at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8, to present the subpoena in person. "We will plan to hold a press conference late in the day of Aug. 8," Vogt said, "and if the document we see varies from the birth certificate documents the White House released, we plan to file criminal charges in Hawaii immediately." Get the New York Times best-seller "Where's the Birth Certificate? The Case that Barack Obama Is Not Eligible to be President," by Jerome Corsi. Vogt shared with WND a copy of a letter he has written to Hawaii Attorney General David Louie, putting Louie on notice regarding the reasons he believes the birth certificate released by the White House is fraudulent. (Story continues below) WND previously reported on Vogt's decision to file a 22-page criminal complaint with the FBI. Irey says it won't take long to evaluate the original birth record, if it exists. "Over the years of my career, I've seen everything that can be put on paper," he said. "Now that I'm thoroughly familiar with what the White House released, I will be able to tell you within a few minutes, if what the Hawaii DOH has matches what the White House has released, or not. "I will expect to see the same differences in typeface that are on the White House version, otherwise I will know immediately that what the Hawaii DOH is showing us is a forgery."

After awhile he catches two nice sized fish, and as it is starting to get dark, he packs up his stuff, ties the fish up and throws them over his back, and leaves. About half way back to his car...he suddenly realizes that something is following him. He turns around and a 7 foot tall Bigfoot is standing 3 feet behind him, and is just starring at him. Not knowing what to do, he hands the Bigfoot both of the fish. The Bigfoot takes the fish, looks at them, then hands one back to the guy and walks away.&&&15

Would anybody in their right mind put mayonnaise on a $50 steak? No way! Why not? It would ruin the flavor. Then why do people eat mayonnaise at all? Because it's just there, and people have been force-fed it their entire lives. Companies even try to hide it in things like honey mustard, which shouldn't be anything but honey and mustard. Why do they hide it? It's the food industry's equivalent to brain-washing.&&&19

Smoke some more dope Abercrombie&&&HONOLULU (AP)-- Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said Thursday it's "so stupid" that the cash-strapped state pays millions to host the Pro Bowl when the money could be used for education. Abercrombie said he opposes a deal the state made in 2009 to pay $4 million per game for the rights to hold the NFL's all-star game in Hawaii this and next year. "You can't do things like give 4 million bucks to a $9 billion football industry and not give any money to children," Abercrombie said as he announced early childhood education and health plans. "You've got this spectacle of these multimillionaires and billionaires out there arguing about how they're going to divide it up, and then they come and ask us to bribe them with $4 million to have a scrimmage out here in paradise. "We've got to get our values straight and our priorities straight." The Pro Bowl returned to Aloha Stadium this year after it was played in Miami in 2010, breaking up a 30-year run in Hawaii in which every game was a sellout. The first-year Democratic governor and former longtime congressman said the NFL can ship the game back to Florida if it continues to require Hawaii to pay to keep it in the islands. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league has no comment on Abercrombie's statements. Tourism officials said this January's Pro Bowl attracted 17,000 visitors to the state, generated $28.15 million in visitor spending and created $3.07 million in state taxes from people who traveled to attend the game. But Abercrombie dismissed the economic impact of the game, saying newly enacted same-sex civil unions will do just as much to bring visitors to the state. "Oh please. We'll get more out of civil unions in a weekend then we'll get out of those guys," he said. "We're going to market. Don't worry about marketing." Apparently the idea of investing money to MAKE MORE money is lost on a burned out child of the sixties. Civil unions? yeah that will make more money than the NFL.&&&61

Truth is the little girl knew that his heart was good and that is why she knew she was safe with him, and was not kicking, screaming, or running away with him. Instead she felt safe enough to leave her yard to get her some candy. She is smart, and responsible for a lil 4 yr old, otherwise her dad would have not left her unattended outside. Right?

Bachmanns a Republican candidarte for president is caught lieing&&&Looks like Michelle Bachmanns rising star status has already hit a dead end.Pulitzer Prize winning a fact checking service examining 24 of her statements found just 1 that is fully true.17 to be FALSE(7 to be pants on FIRE FALSE). There is no other candidate in history(running for president) that has such a lieing BS record of inaccuracy.So much for California based Guru and Infidel Hawaii's known fabricater of false statements(LIAR) for posting that Michelle Bachmann is eating Obama up in the polls.That may have been so until TODAY when she was found out to be just another LIEING REPUBLICAN. Hell she even matched Sara Palins Paul revere history screw up stating that John Wayne was born in her Waterloo Iowa town. He was born 150 miles away. The only famous Wayne that lived there is John Wayne GACY responsible for(pay attention Infidel) 33 MAHU sexual motivated killings. Politifact caught her without her panties when she claimed that she recieved no income from a family farm that recieved Federal aide.Well it looks like its back to the drawing board for a candidate that can at least tell the truth. Stand bye folks this scandel is just starting to unravel as we will hear more about Michelle Bachmanns lies. What was she thinking that a candidate for presidency can get away without someone FACT CHECKING her? U STUPID brithers(Guru,Infidel, and Joe Balls) should have waited before jumping the gun with claims that she is the Conservatives MESSIAH.&&&12

Medical liability reform bill killed&&&Medical malpractice tort reform should be passed not because it will solve the doctor shortage problem, but because it is the right thing to do. Just as we cannot sue judges, parol boards, state psychologists, etc. when they make a human error and put a dangerous criminal back on the street, who then goes ahead and kills or harms another citizen, so should we indemnify our doctors when they make a human error. The legislation will never pass only because the trial lawyers ("consumer lawyers"), who make a handsome living from all this, contribute so heavily to the campaign funds of the legislators. Old fashioned payola, old fashioned politics.&&&78

Death: Donald Scott Whtie&&&Could anyone help me? Our neighbor received a call a little while ago from their sister-in-law that informed them that his brother (adopted) is dead. She told them that he died on June 9th and that his body was still at the funeral home. She would not tell them the name of the funeral home or anything about his death, he was also retired from the Air Force. Could any of you tell me if you may have seen an obituary in the paper about him. He was also called Bobby. We are more than 4000 miles away from Hawaii and are just looking for some info so that our neighbor can make arrangements for the funeral if need be or at least to come out and lay flowers/wreath at the grave. Thank any of you for your assistance it is truly appreciated.&&&1
Romney leads Obama in polls!&&&Hang on America!!!..17 more months and Obama the FAILURE is finally out of our WH...Hope and Change is on the way, YES WE CAN!!! The public opinion boost President Obama received after the killing of Osama bin Laden has dissipated, and Americans disapproval of how he is handling the nations economy and the deficit has reached new highs, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. The survey portrays a broadly pessimistic mood in the country this spring as higher gasoline prices, sliding home values and a disappointing employment picture have raised fresh concerns about the pace of the economic recovery. By 2 to 1, Americans say the country is pretty seriously on the wrong track, and nine in 10 continue to rate the economy in negative terms. Nearly six in 10 say the economy has not started to recover, regardless of what official statistics may say, and most of those who say it has improved rate the recovery as weak. New Post-ABC numbers show Obama leading five of six potential Republican presidential rivals tested in the poll. But he is in a dead heat with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who formally announced his 2012 candidacy last week, making jobs and the economy the central issues in his campaign. Among all Americans, Obama and Romney are knotted at 47 percent each, and among registered voters, the former governor is numerically ahead, 49 percent to 46 percent.&&&39

Democrat Weiner RESIGNS because of cyberflirting/lying&&&Democrat Anthony Weiner resigned today as U.S. representative from the 9th District of New York, saying the decision would benefit his party, constituents and wife Huma Abedin. "I'm announcing my resignation from Congress so my colleagues can get back to work, my neighbors can choose a new representative and, most importantly, that my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage I have caused," Weiner said at a news conference made raucous by loud yells from hecklers. "I had hoped to be able to continue the work that the citizens of my district elected me to do," he said. "Unfortunately, the distraction that I have created has made that impossible."&&&20

Dont you just love it when the Dems eat each other alive?? Altogether now (smart people):WE TOLD YOU SO!!! A new poll found that a majority of younger voters disapprove of President Obama's handling of the economy. The results suggest Republicans have an opportunity to win back some of the younger voters who backed Obama in 2008. Obama vowed on the campaign trail to change Washington, but 69 percent of poll respondents contend that leaders in the nation's capital are failing to serve their generation.&&&44

Democrat Anthony Weiner should resign!&&&During several television interviews, he looked the American people straight in the eye and adamantly claimed he didnt send half nekkid pics of his weiner to women on the internet, he claimed his computer was hacked, he slandered Andrew Breibart and accused him of being the hacker all the while knowing he sent the half nekkid weiner pics himself. More proof Democrats are shamless liars, they will look you straight in the eye and LIE, LIE, LIE! __________ In a bombshell announcement, Brooklyn-Queens Congressman Anthony Weiner admitted Monday afternoon to sending racy online messages to six women over the last three years, after claiming for several days that he had nothing to do with a lewd photo posted from his Twitter account. Speaking at a Midtown press conference, the prospective mayoral candidate said he will not resign from Congress and that he accepts "full responsibility" for his actions. "This is a deep weakness that I have demonstrated," Weiner said. The 46-year-old congressman said he has never had sex outside his marriage, and said that he sent the suggestive messages and pictures to women he had never met in person. He broke down several times while apologizing to his wife and his supporters. "Over the past few years I have engaged in several inappropriate conversations conducted over Twitter, Facebook, e-mail and occasionally over the phone with women I had met online. I've exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years," Weiner said. "For the most part these communications took place before my marriage, but some of them sadly took place after."&&&65

Lawmakers adopted the amendment to a military appropriations bill by a vote of 248 to 163.

Maybe the typist changed the IBM Selectric ball repeatedly during the course of typing the document, that makes sense huh? Scroll down to the letter chart and look at the difference in letter font. The small e is the worst in my opinion, the horizontal versus angled line. In other words, this is even more proof of a cut and paste forgery. This on top of the verified NINE layers in the PDF document. Now WHY would the bisexual marxist need to forge a birth certificate??????????

We ALL dislike him and his policies. He is unable to manage, he has bankrupted the country and has formed alliances with the extremely wealthy and does not care about the people. We are now looking for another place for him to reside. Please help America and take him in. Also be aware he needs homosexual partners, extravegant living arrangements for extended family members, multiple illicit drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, direct communications with know terrorists both foreign and domestic. Please let us know soon. Thank you. P.S., We asked Kenya, and they refused.&&&7
9.1% Unemployment&&&In the good ole days, when the GREAT President Bush was in office, the unemployment rate averaged 5%...and random shootings and home invasions here in Hawaii were unheard of. BRING BACK BUSH!! The nation's job market took a turn for the worse last month as employers sharply pulled back their hiring and the unemployment rate edged up to 9.1 percent, the Labor Department said Friday. The discouraging report provided the latest and strongest evidence of a sputtering economic recovery. In recent days, various data have pointed to a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as persistent weakness in the depressed housing market.&&&8
Obama Birth Certificate&&&Repost from the Chicago forum: In the hospital the relatives gathered in the waiting room, where a family member lay gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came in looking tired and somber. "I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news, he said as he surveyed the worried faces. The only hope left for your loved one at this time is a brain transplant. It's an experimental procedure, very risky, but it is the only hope. Insurance will cover the procedure, but you will have to pay for the BRAIN." The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a time, someone asked,'How much will a brain cost?' The doctor quickly responded, "$5,000 for a Democrat's brain; $200 for a Republican's brain." The moment turned awkward. Some of the Democrats actually had to 'try' to not smile, avoiding eye contact with the Republicans. A man unable to control his curiosity, finally blurted out the question everyone wanted to ask, "Why is the Democrats brain so much more than a Republicans brain?" The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and explained to the entire group, "It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to price the Republicans brains a lot lower because they've been used." SEND THIS TO A SMART Republican WHO NEEDS A LAUGH, AND TO ANY Democrat WHOM YOU THINK CAN HANDLE IT!&&&1

ATTENTION RESIDENTS OF FOREST CITY: CONDITIONS MUST IMPROVE!&&&We would like to hear from residents who have experienced issues (past or present of any kind) in regards to Forest City Management. The intent would be to forward a Strength In Numbers packet to various city government, consumer agencies and media resources. These concerns must also go beyond Hawaiian jurisdiction. Hopefully the efforts of a few brave & committed military family members will bring forth necessary change. The Following Items Would Greatly Assist Our Efforts:  Letters - Providing full names is preferred, but not necessary. The resident can use their initials, or simply choose to remain anonymous.  Photos and/or video backing claims of deferred or inferior maintenance.  Any data pointing to safety/liability issues.  Links to other resources documenting complaints against Forest city. Please contact: Thecwexperience@hotmail.com for additional info. Place Forest City in the subject lineThanks in advance for your support!&&&1

Kahala brand succeeds by going back to roots&&&Heart?! Their products are good, but $50,$60, approaching $100 for an aloha shirt, where's the heart or Aloha in that? Every company wants to be profitable, but let's be real about buying an aloha shirt. Obviously there is plenty of demand, and they're able to meet the demand. Is it really necessary to charge this much for a product? Let's trying thinking outside the box for a moment. How about a kamaaina rate for their line of aloha shirts. How could this affect profits and/or the competition? Since things "Hawaiian" are in such demand not only here, but nationally and internationally, maybe a similar pricing could apply to any other product being swooped up by consumers, that has its roots in, promotes, and is unique to Hawaii? Just a thought.&&&28

Getting Laid in Honolulu - NSA General Rules&&&How does one get laid in Honolulu with no strings attached (NSA)? Now, before you judge the question please understand the motive. Simply put, some people are new to the adult scene and adult nite-life and need some basic guidelines to understand. Rules really are very simple and straight. Some people however, really don't mean NSA. Here are basic rules everyone should follow. 1) No strings attached mean no commitments, games, foolishness. 2) No quickies or long over nighters unless mutual. 3) It's not cheating as long as there's no guilt. 4) Clean people can have clean fun. It's no one elses business. 5) Sex is meant to be fun or it would not feel so good. 6) Agree on type of sex. I.e., Straight sex only. No surprises! 7) Date like-minded people only. Opposites are dangerous. 8) Age IS always a factor. Don't kill the old guy. 9) Do not look for a 10 when a 3 will do. Any could do. 10) If you're a 5 or 8, say so and don't fool yourself or others! 11) Mutual neutral location, mutually agreed upon. 12) USE PROTECTION and HAVE FUN! Feel free to add or comment as necessary. And have fun!!!&&&17

Schnabel gets 20 years&&&Good riddance for Schnabel. It's too bad that he couldn't have been put away sooner. A 20 year sentence seems like a good number but I wonder if he will mature enough within that time period to really change his ways. He will be about 43 years old and it is really questionable if he will really change his ways. Some people are just bad and can't just change all of a sudden. I'm sure that he regrets his actions but it is only because he realizes that he is going to prison for 20 years. I doubt that he is sorry for the victim.&&&213

Obama hurts Israel&&&How Obama has hurt Israel and helped Palestinians. If you have been paying attention at all you know what Obama did recently and since he has been in office is no better. He has hurt our friend Israel. What Obama Did To Israel Every Arab-Israeli negotiation contains a fundamental asymmetry: Israel gives up land, which is tangible; the Arabs make promises, which are ephemeral. The long-standing American solution has been to nonetheless urge Israel to take risks for peace while America balances things by giving assurances of U.S. support for Israel's security and diplomatic needs. It's on the basis of such solemn assurances that Israel undertook, for example, the Gaza withdrawal. In order to mitigate this risk, President George W. Bush gave a written commitment that America supported Israel absorbing major settlement blocs in any peace agreement, opposed any return to the 1967 lines and stood firm against the so-called Palestinian right of return to Israel. For two and a half years, the Obama administration has refused to recognize and reaffirm these assurances. Then last week in his State Department speech, President Obama definitively trashed them. He declared that the Arab-Israeli conflict should indeed be resolved along "the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps." Nothing new here, said Obama three days later. "By definition, it means that the parties themselves -- Israelis and Palestinians -- will negotiate a border that is different" from 1967. It means nothing of the sort. "Mutually" means both parties have to agree. And if one side doesn't? Then, by definition, you're back to the 1967 lines. Nor is this merely a theoretical proposition. Three times the Palestinians have been offered exactly that formula, 1967 plus swaps -- at Camp David 2000, Taba 2001, and the 2008 Olmert-Abbas negotiations. Every time, the Palestinians said no and walked away. And that remains their position today: The 1967 lines. Period. Indeed, in September the Palestinians are going to the U.N. to get the world to ratify precisely that -- a Palestinian state on the 67 lines. No swaps. read the rest...&&&17

American kids to blame for Chinese Slavery&&&Just Kidding but this story is sad and strange and true.. Chinese Prisoners Forced to Play World of Warcraft, Detainee Says Liu Dali told The Guardian website that guards traded the credits inmates built up playing games such as World of Warcraft for money."Prison bosses made more money forcing inmates to play games than they do forcing people to do manual labor," he said. "There were 300 prisoners forced to play games. We worked 12-hour shifts in the camp. I heard them say they could earn 5000-6000rmb a day. "We didn't see any of the money. The computers were never turned off." The building up and trading of game credits is known as gold farming. Millions of gamers around the world pay real money for the credits in order to save hours of playing time. Gold farming is rampant in China and other developing nations. Many Chinese gamers have full-time jobs as gold farmers but The Guardian story highlights the first time it has been practiced in labor camps. Quoting figures from the China Internet Center, the paper says almost 1.2 billion ($1.65 billion) worth of virtual currencies was traded in China in 2008. Read more:&&&3

Snake Causes Power Outtage&&&Posted: 2:05 AM May 25, 2011 ---------- Snake causes explosion and fire at substation: Thousands of people lost power in Berea early Wednesday morning after an explosion and fire rocked the substation. People living in the Hickory Lane area of Berea say they heard the explosion around 1 Wednesday morning. When firefighters and electrical crews arrived on the scene, they found the substation engulfed in flames. Some iWitness viewers sent us video showing the fire, which lit up the night sky. "I looked through the blind, and it was just light outside," Sue Cain, who lives nearby, said. "A green light outside. The sky was totally lit. You could feel the heat from four doors away from the fire." Officials with East Kentucky Power and Blue Grass Energy say a snake sparked all the trouble. "The snake did get into the equipment," Nick Comer with East Kentucky Power/Blue Grass Energy, said. "It did apparently cause a short circuit and caused the fire." Comer says the explosions followed because of certain equipment that contains oil. Firefighters had to let the fire burn itself out because of the oil and electricity. Blue Grass Energy officials say 3,200 customers initially lost power, including Silver Creek Elementary School. Students at the school are spending the day at Madison Southern High School, where they got to enjoy field day. Electrical workers are installing a mobile substation to restore power to all the customers who lost it. As of noon, 1,600 customers were still without power. Blue Grass Energy officials hope to have electricity restored to everyone by later Wednesday afternoon. Officials with Madison County Schools say they expect students at Silver Creek Elementary to be back in school Thursday morning. However, they say they'll make a decision in the morning if the power is still out.&&&5

Following a number of comments made by Cain regarding his attitudes toward Muslim people, he was asked in March 2011 if he would feel comfortable appointing a Muslim to his administration or as a Judge. Cain said "No, I will not ... There's this creeping attempt, there's this attempt, to gradually ease Shariah Law, and the Muslim faith into our government. It does not belong in our government"[25][26] and he went on to cite court cases in Oklahoma[27] and New Jersey as evidence.[28] This led to criticisms of "bigotry" and "muslim bashing" from CAIR, whose spokesperson stated "It would be laughable if it weren't having such a negative impact on the lives of Muslim Americans".[29][30] After the May 5, 2011 Fox News-sponsored Presidential debate, Cain was declared the winner by pollster Frank Luntz.[31][32]&&&10

Obama Foreign Policy Flubs&&&Obama this week alone showed his lack of a solid plan that is US and US ally friendly. Top 10 Obama Foreign Policy Flubs from Barack Obama brought to the presidency the foreign policy experience of a community organizer, that is to say, none. And it shows. If there is such a thing as an Obama Doctrine, it might be this: React slowly to a foreign crisis and, in a conflict, pick a side hostile to U.S. interests. Here are the Top 10 Obama Foreign Policy Flubs. 1. Libya: NATOs Obama-backed Libyan excursion is entering its third month with no end in sight, as Muammar Gaddafi and the ill-trained and ill-equipped rebel forces battle to a stalemate. Without the U.S. taking the dominant military lead, NATOs feeble effort is exposing a shocking weakness in the military alliance. And Obama still hasnt explained why Gaddafis troops shooting into crowds warrants retribution, while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad can do the same with impunity. What an ill-conceived effort, with no real leadership and no clear goals. 2. Iran: In 2009, when Tehran protesters looked to Washington for help, Obama offered little support as he held on to the dream that his magical words could sway Irans Islamist leaders. His naive stance snubbed the masses of people hoping for democratic reform while ensuring that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will continue his march to make Iran a nuclear power. 3. Egypt: First, Vice President Joe Biden says longtime U.S. ally Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is not a dictator, then the administration calls for him to step aside. By withdrawing support for Mubarak, Obama sent shock waves to other U.S. allies in the Middle Eastincluding oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Bahrainand gave an opening for the Muslim Brotherhood to rise to power. 4. The Dollar: Fed Chairman Ben Bernankes policy of qualitative easing is eroding the dollar while encouraging inflation. International holders of U.S. dollars are not pleased to see the drop, spurring talk of a different currency to dominate the worlds financial system. Along with the Obama deficits, Americas creditworthiness is in question.&&&9
Look what Oklahoma just did&&&Subject: Fw: OKLAHOMA did it!!!! This is great, hope it catches on throughout the country. While everyone is focusing on Arizona 's new law, look what Oklahoma has been doing!!!! An update from Oklahoma : Oklahoma law passed, 37 to 9, had a few liberals in the mix, an amendment to place the Ten Commandments on the front entrance to the state capitol. The feds in D.C., along with the ACLU, said it would be a mistake. Hey this is a conservative state, based on Christian values...! HB 1330 Guess what......... Oklahoma did it anyway. Oklahoma recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal immigrants, and ship them back to where they came from unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. HB 1804. Hope we didn't send any of them to your state. This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU, they said it would be a mistake. Guess what.......... Oklahoma did it anyway. Recently we passed a law to include DNA samples from any and all illegal's to the Oklahoma database, for criminal investigative purposes. Pelosi said it was unconstitutional SB 1102 Guess what........ Oklahoma did it anyway. Several weeks ago, we passed a law, declaring Oklahoma as a Sovereign state, not under the Federal Government directives. Joining Texas , Montana and Utah as the only states to do so. More states are likely to follow: Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolina's, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, West Virginia,Mississippi, Florida. Save your confederate money, it appears the South is about to rise up once again. HJR 1003 The federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I'm sure that was a set back for the criminals. The Liberals didn't like it -- But ..... Guess what.......... Oklahoma did it anyway. Just this month, the state has voted and passed a law that ALL driver's license exams will be printed in English, and only English, and no other language. They have been called racist for doing this, but the fact is that ALL of the road signs are in English only. If you want to drive in Oklahoma , you must read and write English. Really simple. By the way, the Liberals don't like any of this either. Guess what...who cares... Oklahoma is doing it anyway. If you like it, pass it on.&&&8

Obama stands wih the Palestineans...&&&Still need proof he's a Muslim?? President Barack Obama is endorsing the Palestinians' demand for their future state to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war, in a move that will likely infuriate Israel. Israel says the borders of a Palestinian state have to be determined through negotiations. In a speech outlining U.S. policy in the Middle East and North Africa, Obama on Thursday sided with the Palestinians' opening position a day ahead of a visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu is vehemently opposed to referring to the 1967 borders.&&&16

Day of Yahweh&&&Morality was apply within only a particular tribes agreements, and the rightness of action on its collective mood towards addressing other groups, its individuated and localized to only particular groupings, and really should have reality within the attendant cultural paradigms who agree with it. But the Israelites had a specific worldview, and they imposed that worldview; that radical new world view was monotheism. The eating off this tree of knowledge of good and bad has caused a moral conflict and tension between Yahwehs good design for creation. The drama of humanitys life should revolve not around the search for eternal life, nor preoccupation with immortality; it was not in Yahwehs design for this kind of drama. Its the power of moral choice alone that is godlike. Moralitys about balance and survival, and the methods arent as important as the mannerisms in preserving humanity for eons instead of centuries, as humanity is walking in the footsteps of so called ancient civilizations in odious and strange ways. A pop culture where the modus litany puts valuables before values, character, ethic, writes a recipe for ruin. The error is as deep as the nature of man, humanity cannot expect any deliverance from it so long as the nature of man continues the same, and humanitys natural love of truth almost as depraved as humanitys natural love of holiness. Humanity has before it the opportunity to become a conscious cooperator, no longer must we be merely unconscious players at the mercy of forces and energies beyond our control. Today we are intelligent enough and conscious enough to see the patterns and cycles that converge to form human destiny. Today humanity can take an active part in molding that destiny and not be simply the unwitting subject of the forces of change. But awaiting humanity is the Day of Yahweh, a popular idea among the Israelites, that on some future occasion, Yahweh would dramatically intervene in world affairs and he would do so on Israels behalf. He would lead Israel in victory over her enemies. They would be punished. Israel would be restored to her full and former glory. Remember those covenants,&&&4

In the islam countries they dont protest and say things.. they bomb christian churches and kill it's members. This is a huge difference!! HUGE!!! CNN needs to get a grip along with the rest of the LIBERAL wingnuts..this is AMERICA we CAN protest and TALK about things we don't like or agree with. It is our RIGHT!!! We have freedoms and a vote unlike those countries that CNN and the liberal wingnuts hold up so high with their American hating arms. They also support the poor poor PROTESTING muslims in other countries all while those they support would kill those idiot liberal wingnuts in a heart beat and if they went to their country those huggable muslim protesters if in charge would cut their throats if they tried to practice Christianity in their town!! These liberal cry babies need to grow up and get and come to reality. So what if Americans are "speaking" against muslim mosques in their neighborhood.

Aside from the likelihood that Ensign will face criminal charges, recent revelations dont paint a very good picture of Sen. Tom Coburn, former senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum, nor the Justice Department. When details of his affair with the wife of a former staffer and close family friend revealed what looked to many observers like a cover-up  including the payment of large sums of money via his parents  Ensign announced that he would not run for reelection. Then last week he abruptly resigned his seat in order to avoid having to personally face a Senate Ethics Committee investigation and his likely expulsion from the Senate.

Johnny Isakson (R) of Georgia issued its scathing report. “Based on the record in this matter, the Special Counsel respectfully submits that there is substantial credible evidence that provides substantial cause to conclude that Senator Ensign violated Senate Rules and federal civil and criminal laws, and engaged in improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate, thus betraying the public trust and bringing discredit to the Senate, Among other things, the report alleges that Ensign and his parents made illegal payments to his mistress and her husband, made false or misleading statements to the Federal Election Commission, and “permitted spoliation [alteration or destruction] of documents and engaged in potential obstruction of justice violations. The committee has referred the matter to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. Critics wonder why the Justice Department appears not to have pursued the Ensign case with any sense of vigor. Last December, the Justice Department informed Ensign's lawyers that he was "no longer a target" in a corruption probe. It is puzzling how DOJ, armed with the full might of the legal system, was unwilling or unable to reach the same conclusions as the ethics committee, said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, in a statement.Perhaps this report will give DOJ the spine it so clearly lacks, and the courage to finally take on Senator Ensign. "It is only a question of when the government is going to indict," Douglas McNabb, a federal criminal defense attorney, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal Friday. "I don't understand why they set it aside before." Meanwhile, Ensigns personal disgrace and political downfall appears to have touched at least two of his Senate colleagues. Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R) of Pennsylvania  who lost his reelection bid in 2006 and is now running for president on a platform stressing family values  learned of the Ensign affair in an email from Doug Hampton, Ensigns former chief of staff and husband of Ensigns mistress Cynthia Hampton. Hampton reportedly was seeking Santorums help. But rather than reply to Hampton, Santorum forwarded the email to Ensign, tipping him off to the impending scandal. As the episode continued, Sen. Tom Coburn (R) of Oklahoma became involved in negotiating financial payment to the Hamptons (which involved Ensigns parents) apparently as a way of settling the situation in a way that would limit political damage. As the Senate Ethics Committee report details, theres much more to the story  including Ensigns trying to generate lobbying business for Mr. Hampton after Hampton was pushed out of his job working for the Nevada senator. None of it is likely to do any good to the reputation of Sen. Coburn or to the presidential ambitions of Mr. Santorum.&&&1

He kaulike ko ka nuhou? - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Synopsis: Media coverage of Hawaiians tends to ignore successful endeavors while highlighting those activities that perpetuate negative stereotypes." To the extent that statement is true, it is true because Hawaiian institutions inflict those stereotypes on Hawaiians in an effort to portray themselves as poor, downtrodden victims in need of huge gobs of money from the government. Kamehameha Schools has a very large research division whose main activity is to do data mining of Census Bureau statistics in order to prove that ethnic Hawaiians have the lowest income, highest levels of incarceration and drug abuse, worst victimhood for breast cancer and diabetes, etc. etc. etc. Then they send out press releases about it, and the newspapers dutifully publish articles about it. Gordon Pang, an Advertiser reporter, is one of the media shills for the Hawaiian victimhood grievance industry. One of his articles was so outrageous that I wrote a 30-page webpage rebutting some of the data and showing how stoooopid it was. See: "Forced assimilation may hurt Hawaiians" -- A typical combination of junk history and junk science fueling the Hawaiian grievance industry&&&16
Where is the rail money?&&&$2B for rail projects, speed upgrades announced I do not see hawaii listed do you? "Republican members of Congress have also opposed funds for high-speed trains, rescinding $400 million of the money previously awarded to Florida, as well as other unspent money designated for trains in budget deliberations with the administration." Keep public in loop on rail costs "City officials insist that the Federal Transit Administration is still flashing green lights that the funding will be forthcoming. We cautiously accept their assertions, but Honolulu taxpayers must be forgiven for feeling wary. There's a reason why "I'll believe it when I see it" is a common human reaction."&&&5

Matson the greedy monopoly raising its rates AGAIN...DIG DEEPER HAWAII!!&&&WHAAAAT?? 4 RATE HIKES IN 5 MONTHS?? Must be nice to be a filthy rich, greedy monopoly protected by the Democrat regime...you can use any lame excuse to rip people off and get away with it. The price of most goods sold in the islands will likely rise next month as Matson Navigation Co. boosts shipping costs for the fourth time this year. The largest ocean shipper for Hawaii will raise its fuel surcharge June 12 by 4 percentage points to 47.5 percent, the highest since Matson first imposed the fee in 1999. The increase follows 8.5 percentage point rises in March and May. "Higher fuel prices means higher prices for everyone, which will put some businesses out of business because less people will start buying things," said Eric Wong, owner of fast-food and catering companies Wiki Wiki Drive Inn and Loco Moco Ewa Beach. "They'll make the choice of not spending the money to eat out. My business works with a very price-sensitive community, such as Ewa Beach and West Oahu. When Matson goes up 40-plus percent, I'm sure my teriyaki beef will go up 20 percent as well."&&&4
"Common" Nonsense&&&Brent Bozell 'Common' Nonsense The Obamas want credit for bringing American culture to the White House. When they decided to celebrate poetry at the White House on May 10, it was really not a surprise they would try to make it socially "relevant" by inviting a rap music "artist" to unload some rhymes. The rapper goes by the name "Common" (real name: Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.). He is celebrated by many on the left as a "socially conscious" street poet. But that's not the way it was seen by cops in New Jersey. ABC reporter Jake Tapper blogged that Dave Jones, president of the New Jersey State Trooper Fraternal Association, was contacted by the White House about trooper objections. Obama officials claimed they had never heard of Joanne Chesimard (who renamed herself Assata Shakur), a woman Common celebrated in "song." Who is Chesimard? "She's a domestic terrorist who wrapped her criminality and her abhorrent anti-social behavior in a cause to try to disguise her disgust for America in this make-believe 1960s radicalism," Jones explained. "In 1973, she executed Trooper Werner Foerster with his own gun after he was already shot and didn't represent a threat to anyone. And after she shot him, she kicked him in the head to the point that hours later, after he was picked up, his brain was still part of the remnants on her shoe." Common wrote "A Song for Assata," claiming this "queen of the Black Liberation Army" was innocent: "Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done," Common rapped. "Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun ... I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me/All of this s--- so we could be free." The song also features Cee Lo Green singing, "I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah/Listen to my love, Assata, yeah/We're molded from the same mud, Assata/We share the same blood, Assata, yeah ... Your power and pride, so beautiful /May God bless your soul." That's sick. In 1977, Chesimard was found guilty of first-degree murder, assault and battery of a police officer, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to kill, illegal possession of a weapon and armed robbery, and was sentenced to life in prison. In November 1979, she escaped from prison and made her way to her revolutionary paradise in Cuba. Since May 2, 2005, the FBI has classified her as a "domestic terrorist" and offered a $1 million reward for assistance in her capture. Her "revolutionary" actions are now being celebrated at the Obama White House. Common is also a champion of another convicted cop-killer, Mumia Abu-Jamal, also a radical cause celebre. In a Def Poetry Jam rhyming session, Common declared, "We all children of Allah, keep on. Fliers say 'Free Mumia' on my freezer." I am just shocked!! NOT!&&&1

Obama walks away sister of 9/11 victim&&&Obama Rejects Plea From Sister of 9/11 Victim to End to CIA Probe The sister of a Sept. 11 victim said President Obama on Thursday turned down her request to advise Attorney General Eric Holder to drop his probe of CIA agents whose interrogation methods may have provided information leading to the raid on Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden. Debra Burlingame, whose brother was the pilot of American Airlines Flight 77, which was hijacked and forced into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, told Fox News on Thursday that she made the request during Obama's meeting with families of victims of the Al Qaeda attack. When the president approached her table, Burlingame said she told him that as a former attorney she knows he can't tell the attorney general what to do  an assessment the president agreed with, she said. "And I said, but that shouldn't stop you from offering your opinion. After all, we wouldn't be here celebrating today if they hadn't done their job," she said. "And they have the hammer of a possible indictment over their heads. Can't you at least give him your opinion?" The president replied that he wouldn't, she said. She added, "And he turned around and walked away." Holder launched the investigation in late 2009, appointing a special prosecutor to review cases of possible detainee abuse at the hands of CIA agents. Around the same time, the administration shifted responsibility for interrogations of top terror suspects away from the CIA. At the beginning of his presidency, Obama had ordered that interrogations stick to the guidelines in the Army Field Manual. Republicans and ex-officials wants the Obama administration to not only restart the CIA interrogation program in some form but to end the probe of CIA employees. Debate has been raging on Capitol Hill over whether so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, played a role in tracking bin Laden. The White House says that a range of sources contributed, and that no single bit of information was a deciding factor. Read more:&&&6

And heres Nancy Pelosi yesterday: The death of Osama bin Laden marks the most significant development in our fight against al-Qaida.... I salute President Obama, his national security team, Director Panetta, our men and women in the intelligence community and military, and other nations who supported this effort for their leadership in achieving this major accomplishment....

BUT how sick is it to post vindictive and made up information just to look important? It does nothing but fan the fires of hatred and racism which seems the real goal of people like Stumpy.&&&6

The girl was playing with her brother in the front yard of their home on Makule Road when a 37-year-old man reached over a chain link fence and snatched the girl, police said. The child's brother told his father what happened. The father notified his friends, who helped launch a search. About 15 to 20 minutes later, one of the family friends found the man and the girl inside a nearby store. Authorities were called. Police arrested the suspect on Fort Weaver Road on kidnapping charges. " I wonder how bad the "man" ( to nice a word ) was beaten ( hopefully ) before the cops arrived?&&&19

By October 17, 1901, 5,000 Puerto Rican men, women and children had made their new homes on the four islands. Records show that, in 1902, 34 plantations had 1,773 Puerto Ricans on their payrolls; 1,734 worked as field hands and another 39 were clerks or overseers (foremen). In 2,000 estimated Puerto Ricans pop was approx 30,000 Now I see in the 2010 census the Latino pop grew by 37.8% I cant find the current exact split of the Illegals or legal Mexicans in Hawaii or the total amount of Puerto Ricans in 2010. I do know what impact the Latinos and the Puerto Ricans have been on the mainland but what about hawaii Will history repeats itself???&&&16
Another man shot DEAD by HPD&&&....violent, heinous crimes continue to rise in this soft on crime DEMOCRAT run state! An off-duty police officer shot and fatally wounded a man at Waimalu Shopping Center on Kamehameha Highway, police said. The man allegedly stole money at gunpoint from a massage business at the center, then made a threatening move with a gun when he was shot, witnesses said. Officials said a man in his 30s or 40s in cardiac arrest was taken to a hospital after sustaining a gunshot wound to his right clavicle. He died at a hospital, police said. Police are also investigating whether there was a robbery at the shopping center. The shooting happened at the Ewa end of the strip mall. Police closed Kauwa and Kanuku streets in the area of the shooting as a result of the investigation. The officer has been assigned to administrative duty. No other suspects are being sought, police spokeswoman Michelle Yu said. Police closed Kauwa and Kanuku streets behind the shopping center. The owner of Sukies Skin Care, who only gave her first name Sukie, said she heard from the owner of Pukana La Massage Therapy that a customer pulled out a handgun after receiving a massage. He took cash and ran out while being chased by the owner at the Ewa end of the shopping center. Hieu Bui, who had just finished eating at a restaurant at the center, said he chased the gunman through the parking lot until he noticed the man was carrying a handgun near the Zippys restaurant on the Diamond Head end of the strip mall. He stopped chasing the man and stood several feet behind a patrol officer who happened to be at the scene directing traffic. The gunman continued to wave the gun in the air and pointed at Biu and the officer, Bui said. The gunman then ran around the back side of the center along Kauwa Street and back toward the Ewa end. Juju Yee, a security guard at Waimalu Shopping Center, said a man told him there was a robbery after finding a purse and shoes on the ground fronting Pukana La Masssage Therapy. He went upstairs to check and found an unspent bullet on the stairwell and the doors of the business already locked. Yee said he walked to an emergency exit on the second floor, looked down and saw a gunman yelling and a police officer in a vest on Kauwa Street. The officer shouted three times at the man to drop his weapon. The man started to lower the weapon toward the officer when the officer shot him in the torso two times, Yee said. Yee said the officer had little choice. "You can't tell what else the man was up to," he said.&&&3

Dog advocates rally - News&&&The propaganda surge begins: Said Shell Ewing, 40, of Mililani: "Passing this law would be like taking away our children." "My dogs are my family," said Elizabeth Cabibi, 37, who recently moved from Seattle to Ewa Beach with her two pit bulls. Here we go again ... created as a breed to kill bulls and having the strength, endurance, ferocity, and jaw power to easily kill a human being, pit bulls are dangerous and need to be banned. The special interests of the breeders are behind the rallying to stop this needed legal protection from even being debated. This breed is chosen by thugs for good reason; they are the preferred dogs for fighting. They have a reputation for turning on their owners and are particularly dangerous to children. They are banned from several countries and many municipalities, and elsewhere are required to be muzzled whenever in public and to be confined behind six foot high fencing where domiciled. What do these other communities know that we do not? Probably that it is time to control these dangerous animals once and for all. The recent series of pit bull attacks (and all of the recent dog attacks were by this breed) cannot be explained away by the breeders although they will try. We owe it to the children to stand up to this lobby and ban the breed from Hawaii.&&&627

By a late Friday night deadline next week, House and Senate conference committees must agree on enough tax hikes and spending reductions to pay for a $1.3 billion government deficit projected over the next two years. Final votes would occur the following week before this year's legislative session adjourns May 5.&&&1

The "discrimination" bill that discriminates against employers&&&...you know ..the guy who owns the freaking business?? The government tells him who he can and cannot hire. Transvestites now have more rights than the person who owns the business. Yes, I kid you not. A proposal to solidify civil rights protections for transgendered employees is headed for the governors desk after the state House agreed to a Senate draft of the bill earlier this week. House Bill 546 would bar employers from discriminating on the basis of gender expression, bringing Hawaiis labor law in line with similar protections in the areas of housing and public accommodations. The House, in a 45-4 vote on Monday, agreed to accept the Senates amended draft of the bill, allowing the proposal to skip the conference committee process and move directly to the Gov. Neil Abercromie for his signature. The bill drew support from the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission as well as many LGBT advocacy groups because it would codify explicit protections against discrimination baed on gender expression, rather than relying on judicial interpretation of civil rights statutes. Today is a great day for all residents of Hawaii, said Alan Spector, co-chairman of Equality Hawaii.Providing employment protections to transgender people in Hawaii is a victory for civil rights. The people of this state should be judged on the quality of work they do and not on who they are  thats what this legislation guarantees. A similar proposal was passed by the Legislature two years ago but was vetoed by then-Gov. Linda Lingle.&&&6

Democrat run Hawaii has the highest gas prices in the nation&&&It's a record the state of Hawaii could do without. On Wednesday the average price of regular unleaded gas reached an all time high, and many experts say it may go even higher. In the past month alone the average price of gas in Hawaii has surged more than 41 cents per gallon. Experts say it's a combination of uncertainty in the Middle East and North Africa and the plummeting value of the U.S. dollar. Here at this gas station you can see the reality of the situation on the overhead sign. The Hawaii average is now at $4.51 per gallon. That's just slightly higher than the previous record, which was set in July of 2008. The average price in Honolulu also set a new record on Wednesday at $4.40 per gallon. In Hilo the average is $4.51 per gallon and in Wailuku, also another record at $4.89. The higher prices will impact consumers here at the pump and elsewhere. "They're gonna see prices rise because that fuel that's being used either to manufacture the product or to transport it is gonna be hidden in the cost of whatever item I'm gonna purchase, so families' budgets are gonna shrink even more beyond just what's at the pump," said Lowell Kalapa of Tax Foundation of Hawaii. Hawaii, on Wednesday, has the highest average price for gas in the nation. That's followed by California and Alaska, which are also above $4 a gallon. However you have to feel for the folks on Molokai who are paying $5.16 a gallon for their fuel.&&&6

Hawaii misses Lingle&&&As honeymoons come and go, it appears that Gov. Neil Abercrombie's is already pau. Last week's Public Policy Polling survey taken for the liberal-progressive website Daily Kos put Abercrombie at a 48 percent job approval. The question was: "Do you approve or disapprove of Gov. Neil Abercrombie's job performance?" Of the 898 registered voters surveyed across the state, 48 percent said they approved, 41 percent said they disapproved and 11 percent were unsure of Abercrombie's performance. Voters who described themselves as liberals, Obama voters or Democrats gave Abercrombie the highest rating, while Republicans and McCain voters had the largest rate of disapproval. The poll is not the final word on Abercrombie's first steps, but it does show that he is not communicating with, or connecting to, Hawaii voters. In comparison, during Gov. Linda Lingle's first year in office, her approval rating was at 71 percent. In fact, from 2003 to 2006 Lingle's job approval never went below 64 percent. It was after the public outcries with schoolteacher furloughs in 2010 that Lingle's approval rating slipped into the mid-40s. Rebecca Ward, president of Ward Research, also notes that the numbers are similar to Lingle during her decline. "I think the low approval among independent voters is the most telling," Ward said, adding that the budget crisis forced Abercrombie into a difficult position early in his administration. I asked three heavy-hitting political consultants, who have all been involved in successful Republican and Democratic campaigns, to comment, if I protected their anonymity. "Obviously you would expect there would be a honeymoon and hope that it continues," said one GOP consultant. "I would be disturbed if it were less than 50 percent in the first year; it is certainly a reflection." The two other consultants, who have worked for both Democrats and Republicans, said that while they had some questions about the poll, it should concern Abercrombie. "The problem with his communications team is that they have no experience in PR and it's beginning to show," said one of them. During the campaign Abercrombie had a strong team of veteran political operatives, who could forcefully tell Abercrombie what was working and what was not  but "those folks aren't around now," the consultant said. The other veteran said the almost-equal approval and disapproval numbers means about half of the people are still wrapped up in Abercrombie's campaign excitement. "The other half ( or slightly less) are beginning to realize they don't know what the plan is, or if there is one. "Perhaps as a plan and direction emerges more clearly, the new governor's poll numbers will improve. Or, there better be some damn good rhetoric," the consultant advised. Dylan Nonaka, state GOP executive director, said last week the party took its own poll. While not disclosing all the results, Nonaka said the poll of 793 registered voters asked: "Is the state going in the right direction economically, since the election of the new governor?" "It was 63 percent no and 37 percent yes," Nonaka said. It will be up to Abercrombie to decide if it is time to declare an in-flight emergency or just hope the smoke in the cockpit clears. &&&37

No excuse for lack of warning signs&&&The 2003 Legislature enacted a law that then-Attorney General Mark Bennett said would "assure both more safety for the public and fair protection for the state" when hikers are injured or killed on state trails. As a Kauai judge has ruled, the law does not let the state off the hook when it neglects to put up signs of danger where needed. When visitors Elizabeth Brem and Paula Ramirez of Oregon came upon two trails on their hike back from the lagoon of Opaekaa Falls on Kauai in December 2006, they came upon two trails. One on the left carried a sign warning "Danger  Keep Out  Hazardous Conditions." So they took the trail on the right, where dense foliage obscured the vertical drop of a steep cliff. Both women, horribly, slipped to their death.&&&12

I am very sorry to hear the news, but he must have been a pistol! I am very familiar with that 442nd Regimental Combat (not command) Team. Many of the members were Japanese Americans from Hawaii. They saw some of the heaviest battles of the European Theatre. Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii was a member and lost an arm in Enzio, Italy. I wish I could have met Mr. Frazier and asked him about those times.&&&3

New investigation into Obama's legitimacy and Hawaii Election Commission&&&Honolulu, Hawaii - At the center of the war over Barack Obamas illegitimacy as president are a series of deep seated, unanswered questions about the detailed involvement of several municipal employees and officials within the government of the State of Hawaii. From former governor, Linda Lingles convenient deniability, to former Health Department director, Chiyome Fukinos intentionally misleading statements about Obamas vital records. From the blatant, dismissive ignorance of Hawaiis legislature about the difference between "U.S. Citizenship" and "Natural-born citizenship", to the claims by a former Honolulu senior elections office clerk that the State of Hawaii does not possess an original, 1961 Certificate of Live Birth for Barack Obama, the State of Hawaii has emerged as the primary co-conspirator in keeping Obamas identity a well kept secret from the American people. Now, however, a new investigation of Hawaiis Election Commission and the laws used by the states Office of Elections to approve or deny candidates for inclusion on presidential ballots raises shocking revelations about the administrative power held by too few unaccountable officials and their unmonitored capacity to override the U.S. Constitution. The evidence reveals that municipal agents, working within the jurisdiction of Hawaii state law and complex administrative rules, opened shadowy legal channels which, ultimately, enabled Obama with an opportunity to usurp presidential power and assault the Constitutional sovereignty of the American people.&&&3

Questions for locals&&&Aloha everyone, We,re arriving in May and wondering if you guys can help us out. We'll be staying at the Ilikai, where we stayed 41 yers ago during my R&R from Viet Nam (we were suppose to be there for our 40th, but had to save more). While we're planning to eat out all the time, we'd like to know where we can buy some beer, wine, and liquor to enjoy on our balcony. Are there any stores near by or a short drive away? Also, which restaurants do you guys go to for Hawaiian food, that are reasonably priced? We'll hit a couple touristy restaurants, but would like to know if there are any good local restaurants that are lesser known that you can recommend. There are so many restaurants, it boggles our mind. When we were there in 1970, we never left Waikiki. This time we want to see the most we can of the island. we have most of the sights and beaches that are listed on the net, but are ther any lesser known places that you can recommend? We'll never be there again and want to make the most of this. Mahalo, Chuck & Phyllis&&&2

Obamanomics: Food and gas prices on a rapid rise&&&Whether it's at the pump or in checkout line at the grocery store, cost of living items are on the rise. A survey by the Wisconsin Farm Bureau shows food prices are up 5 percent this year. The bureau's 'Marketbasket' survey totals the cost of 16 food items. In the first three months of 2011, the total was $48. That is up $2.39 from December's price for the same items. Topping the survey's list Apples increased 24 cents (18 percent) to $1.52 per pound. A gallon of whole milk increased 50 cents (17 percent) to $3.41 per gallon. One pound of bagged salad increased 33 cents (15 percent) to $2.48. A five-pound bag of flour increased 25 cents (12 percent) to $2.34. One pound of ground chuck climbed 32 cents (10 percent) to $3.41. However the study shows Wisconsin's price is more than $1 less than the national survey of the same 16 food items. Prices are rising at the gas pump as well. According to AAA, the price for a gallon of regular grade gasoline in the Green Bay area is $3.767. That is up nearly 25 cents in the last month ($3.529) and about 90 cents form a year ago ($2.883) from this time last year. The highest recorded average price is $4.056 from July 2008&&&10
American_Infidel is stupid&&&Get a life,you stupid hawaii hating jerk. It's good we cant see you in person or we would BUST you up. You're not even hawaiian. You're haole. So,stop calling people haole. Never have I seen a supposed Hawaiian republican.&&&20
People Who Frequently Post Here&&&I use this page ( ) for my homepage. So, everytime I use the internet, this page pops up.I am in college and use the internet very frequently. I have noticed some people are here for hours on end posting comments which seems like every hour on the hour for almost 24 hours a day. Yesterday, I opened my homepage (here) at 2:00pm EST time thru this morning at 5:00 am EST time.Yep, I didnt get too much sleep,researching and all. Someone mentioned this before about people posting every hour on the hour ( I think it was Wahiawa is junk).I will mention this again. Sheesh, people really need to do something else than posting sometimes stupid comments on this forum. Like what Wahiawa is junk said to one of the regulars here,"go get a job and some excerise". This is my first time posting anything here at Topix.But after noticing how people are here almost every hour everyday here, inspired me to make a thread about this problem. I noticed Stumpy, Anti Alice, Alice,American_Infidel and Wahiawa is junk are here everyday. Though not every hour on the hour that Wahiawa person DOES post everyday. I am a republican and am very ashamed of American_Infidel's comments. He has so much hate towards democrats. I have never seen anyone with no much hate. I hope someone will reply to this thread in a polite,non bullying and mature matter. Peace.&&&23

Hawaii appellate court rejects American voter's request to see Obama's BC&&&And were surprised because??? These are handpicked puppets by the regime of course they're going to rule in Odummy's favor. A Hawaii appeals court has rejected a man's request to "inspect and copy" President Barack Obama's birth certificate, saying the plaintiff failed to state a valid claim to having access to the document. Chief Judge Craig Nakamura wrote in an opinion issued Thursday that Robert V. Justice didn't show there were "compelling circumstances" requiring the state Department of Health to show him the birth certificate. Two associate justices of the Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals concurred, one in a separate opinion. Hawaii's privacy laws bar the release of birth records unless the requester is someone with a tangible interest, such as a close family member. Hawaii's former health director has repeatedly said he's verified Obama's original records. Also, two local newspapers published notices of Obama's birth in 1961.&&&1

Hawaii is a great state.&&&Even though Hawaii is a liberal state, it's not as bad as what American_Infidel says it is.

Dont reply to American_Infidel's pointless comments&&&This idiot keeps posting anti liberal,anti democratic and stupid hate filled comments to everything. The best thing to do is to not reply to anymore of his comments. Since this imbecile will not get away from this forum,just flat out ignore him. He does have the right to post his opinions but not to the point when he calls his opponents stupid and idiots.And bullies everyone who disagrees with him. If American_Infidel were to be in a debate, he would lose.He could not go without saying about the people he disagrees with are stupid or are idiots.Instead of just explaining his opinions,he has to insult people's intelligence. Which is funny because who is the one trying to tell the people of Hawaii to be anti liberal,conservative,republica n and non democratic? It's like telling an army soldier to be a navy sailor.People will not change their minds on this forum politically.Especially by reading the comments on this board. Hawaii is a democratic state like it or not.It may take years for Hawaii to vote mostly republican,if it ever will be republican. Please surrender,American_Infidel.NOO NE takes you seriously.&&&4

How adult is his comments where he disrespects others for their rights on who to vote for? Lets get rid of him TODAY so the real adults can have a discussion.&&&8

Sam Slom wants to know whats on Obama's birth certificate&&&The lone Republican in the Hawaii State Senate was interviewed on the radio this morning, explaining that while he believes Barack Obama was born in the Aloha State, he questions what might be on the original, long-form birth certificate that would prompt the president to go to such lengths to conceal it. "I'm not a 'birther,'" Hawaii State Sen. Sam Slom told Jeff Katz of WXKS Radio in Boston, "and I followed this from the very beginning. At first I followed it with amusement, and then I got really concerned about it, because the question was if it was not just the birth certificate, but other records as well  school records, academic records, work records  why would anyone spend millions of dollars in legal fees, particularly someone in public office, particularly someone in the highest public office, to not make that information public?" "There are different theories," Slom continued. "One is that there is no birth certificate at all; I don't think that's true, I think there is a birth certificate. The second is there may be some very interesting information that the president does not want released, for example, who his father really is or what's listed on the birth certificate. "In any event, here is the president of the United States," Slom said, "you've got to have [a birth certificate to present], why don't we require that of the president?"&&&2

According to the GasBuddy gasoline price tracking web site, the price of a gallon of regular gas was around $1.79 when Mr. Obama took office. Today the national average is $3.58. The lowest average price in the continental United States is $3.31 in Tulsa Oklahoma, the highest is $4.14 in Santa Barbara, CA. Four-dollar-a-gallon gas has arrived on average throughout California, and a number of other states are headed in that direction. #&&&29
First there was babies being tossed onto freeways then home invasions&&&Now dead bodies are being found...in this SOFT ON CRIME DEMOCRAT RUN STATE!! Honolulu police detectives are following up on leads in the investigation into the death of a man found at Moanalua Community Park Friday night. Police believe the man may have been in a fight sometime before 11:30 p.m. on Friday. Investigators are still trying to determine if the fight happened at the park or somewhere else, said Det. Gordon Makishima of the Honolulu Police Department. Police said the man, 42, was found by a friend who saw him lying on the ground in the parking lot near the basketball courts with head injuries. The victim was taken to Queen's Medical Center where he died. Police received tips of the man's identification over the weekend after a CrimeStoppers news release on the case, but his identiy remains unconfirmed at this time, said Sgt. Kim Buffett of CrimeStoppers. An autopsy is being performed to determine his exact cause of death.&&&6

The Hawaii Democrat's wacky eco laws put troop lives in jeopardy&&&A Schofield Barracks aviation brigade deploying to southern Afghanistan with 2,600 Hawaii soldiers and 95 helicopters has been unable to conduct high-altitude training on the Big Island because of an inadequate Army environmental assessment, officials said. The delay has put the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade in a time and money crunch. The high-altitude flights are not only required by the Army, but also represent very important lifesaving training, said Col. Frank Tate, brigade commander. Helicopters frequently deliver combat soldiers to high-altitude locations in Afghanistan, where aerodynamics and terrain make flying extra challenging. All of the lives of those soldiers, not only in the air crew but certainly riding in the back, depend on the proficiency of these air crews coming from Hawaii, showing up in Afghanistan and, on day one when they arrive, being able to safely insert and/or extract those people off those kinds of mountaintops, Tate said.&&&7

A source tells CBS News the commission will be held at the Guantanamo Bay prison. Today's announcement represents a pronounced shift in the administration's handling of terrorism cases.

He beat Bush, the last President for both vacation time and time on the golf course. So while Obama was hitting up the links, the world has seen a lot of action. Japan, the Middle East, oil prices and the budget should all come before his vacations, golfing and his March Madness brackets. Obama and the First Lady are both hypocrites in their own rights. Mr. Obama because he constantly is preaching to Americans how cutting back is needed in this economy. He personally told companies, especially those who have taken government bail out money, not to take that "corporate meeting" to Vegas this year. He has preached restraint but as done the exact opposite. Michelle Obama, the First Lady, is just as bad she preaches a health movement but every time we see her she is on vacation eating ice cream.

TRUMP outs OBAMA&&&TRUMP calls out obama! ... Home | Headline Tags: Donald Trump | birth certificate | newsmax | Barack Obama Angry Trump Fires Back: Heres My Official Birth Certificate  Wheres Yours? Tuesday, 29 Mar 2011 01:24 PM By David A. Patten Billionaire real estate developer and rising GOP 2012 prospect Donald Trump is firing back at mainstream media reports that the birth document he provided exclusively to Newsmax on Monday was invalid. Donald Trump Trump has provided Newsmax a signed, dated Certificate of Birth from the City of New Yorks Department of Health. The new birth certificate states that Trump was born in the borough of Queens on June 14, 1946. It is signed by the mayor, the acting registrar of records, and the commissioner of health. Trump said that once he realized the document he provided Newsmax on Monday was not an official birth certificate, it only took him a couple of hours to clear up the matter and locate the official document. Some in the media were challenging my birth certificate, Trump told Newsmax Tuesday morning in an email.So I solved the problem in a couple hours: here is my official Department of Health Birth Certificate. Trump said he is asking for Obama to make his birth certificate public, though he was not suggesting he believes the President was born outside of the country. Anyone can get an official birth certificate  in New York it costs you about $38. I felt obligated to take it to the next step, and get even more than the original hospital birth certificate I provided. It is my honor to present my official birth certificate to the public. Look, I am proud to be an American. It was very easy to do." Trump added:For the sake of the country the president ought to do the same, and end this unfortunate controversy once and for all, Trump told Newsmax. On Monday Trump said that he initially had assumed President Obama had a valid U.S. birth certificate. But on Fox & Friends he said that facts are emerging raising a real question as to whether Obama is constitutionally eligible to serve as president. After Trump provided a certification of birth document to Newsmax on Monday to establish how easy it is to obtain such a document, the Politicos Ben Smith reported that an actual birth certificate must bear the signature of the city registrar. In an obvious gibe at Trump, and perhaps aimed at conspiracy theorists generally, Smith wrote:Trumps mother, it should be noted, was born in Scotland, which is not part of the United States. His plane is registered in the Bahamas, also a foreign country. This fact pattern  along with the wave of new questions surrounding what he claims is a birth certificate  raises serious doubts about his eligibility to serve as president of the United States. Legal sources tell Newsmax that a birth certificate is quite different from the certification of live birth document that the White House has provided to the media. The former officially confirms and records a newborn childs identity, as well of details of the birth. But the latter merely confirms that someone has reported the birth of the child. Because the standards needed to obtain a certificate of live birth are much lower, the sources say, they are easier to obtain. To obtain a copy of a birth certificate, the identity of the person making the request must be established beyond any doubt. A copy of Donald Trumps official birth certificate is below: Read more on : Angry Trump Fires Back: Heres My Official Birth Certificate  Wheres Yours? Important: Do You Support Pres.

GOING GREEN = MORE TAXES..BAG TAX ALERT!!&&&After two years of marketing the alleged horrors of the non-existent Pacific Garbage Patch, environmentalists, big business, and big government are ready to cash in. Senate Bill 1363 requires businesses in the State to collect a 5-cent fee for each (paper or plastic) single-use checkout bag provided to a customer. And after all that work using the equivalent of a mass-marketing campaign to con-vince the public to hate and fear plastic, the State General Fund, supermarkets, and environmentalists have hit on a way to divide up the loot. As is often the case, a scheme launched in Hawaii is envisioned as a model for the shake down of consumers all over the United Statesand it this case, business is already on board. Bob Gutierrez of Times Supermarket writes in support of SB1363: There are various models throughout the United States that address the use of single use bags, and while some are similar throughout states such as California, they lack a uniform approach. Hawaii would be the first state in the union to implement a statewide policy that holds all jurisdictions to the same standard. Participation in SB1363 will reinforce belief in the environmental religion, as one testifier writes:With the proper outreach, this bill could educate the public against a disposable lifestyle. Written testimony from Hawaii Department of Health Director Loretta Fuddy underlines some of the points which remain to be settled in secret by the House-Senate Conference Committee or the Democratic Caucus determining how the co-conspirators will divvy up their loot: The added cost to the department is estimated to be $1,000,000. This bill allows businesses to retain an unspecified percentage of offset fees collected as revenue subject to income tax but exempt from excise tax. Also unspecified is the portion the department is to be deposit into the general fund, and how much the department may retain to implement the program. Penalty amounts are also unspecified. Community outreach, education, litter cleanups =$350,000. Community outreach is code for jobs for enviro-activists. There is a dispute over whether the General Fund will get all of the States loot. Abercrombies budget director Kalbert Young testified March 22: A portion of the fees are to be deposited into a special account in the State general fund for expenditure by the Department of Health for expenses related to the administration and enforcement of this bill. As a matter of general policy, this department does not support the creation of any special account within the general fund of the State for specific purposes. Big business is also getting a cut of the action. Retailers have sharply opposed plastic bag bans on Maui and Kauai, but they are salivating over the bag tax. Lauren Zirbel of the Hawaii Food Industry Association testifies in support of SB1363: We are  pleased that this bill recognizes that it will cost retailers money in increased checkout time due to hassles associated with counting each bag at the point of sale. Without a fee on paper, our current plastic bag ban bills will result in a shift to paper bags. Paper bags can cost as much as 10 times more than plastic bags. Unelected progressives and environmental activists serve as an outlier which elected progressives can point to and then paint themselves as reasonable. For instance, Josh Frost of the Progressive Democrats of Hawaii writes:I would ask that the bill be amended to reinsert the fee amount at 25 cents. Several UH Richardson Law school students wrote testimony begging Legislators not to override the plastic bag bans in Kauai and Maui Counties. Those bag bans were the cudgel with which progressives brought big business to the bargaining table to divvy up the takings. As Bob Gutierrez of Times Supermarket explains in written testimony March 21:&&&7

Hawaii Real Estate & Geography&&&The full original article is at: I used to be a geographer. That sounds like a made-up career to many people, but its true and its a lot more involved than just making maps. I have a Master of Science degree in geography and even completed a few years of doctoral work as well before happily ejecting myself from the academic machine (glutton for punishment, I suppose). What exactly does it mean to be a geographer (and why am I writing about it in a Hawaii real estate blog)? Basically, geographers look at PATTERNS of physical and social relationships and phenomena. Put another way, we look at changes in physical or social characteristics between different places and how these characteristics evolve over time. So now youre probably thinking:Ok, that sounds nice and all, but how does that relate to Hawaii real estate and housing? Great question! The answer is actually quite simple. Im going to coin a phrase here:property expression of society. Real estate is the property expression of a societys values. There are reasons that we settle where we do and where we dont. Do we want to be near the beach? How close to the beach? Or do we prefer to be back in the valleys? How far back? Which side of a northeast facing slope? Where do the different ethnics groups concentrate? Chinatown is called that for a reason but WHY THERE? Waipahu has a high Filipino population, but WHY THERE? These are questions we dont ask ourselves because, for most of us, they are largely academic. We take it for granted  it just is what it is. Imagine taking a snapshot of Oahu or metro Honolulu and coloring in where the different groups have decided to buy or rent property. How would that finished colored photo look? Now imagine doing that once a year for ten or twenty years! How would those colors shift through time? Would you see the patterns changing from year to year? What if you could do it historically and analyze the changing patterns of property ownership for the past 50 years? What might you find? A geographer would do just that: collect data on previous property ownership records, try to assess the different demographic groups to which the owners belonged, and model the change of ownership of those different demographic groups over time and between different places. Theyd likely use a GIS (geographic information system) for the data compilation and analysis and output them in print and/or digital maps. Once you have a deeper understanding and appreciation of these patterns, now comes the big question: WHAT DOES IT MEAN? What are the underlying forces behind these settlement patterns of different people in different places? What causes certain groups to live in certain areas? Is it for social reasons? Economic incentives or job availability? Do these causes themselves change over time? If so, what do these changes in causes or social/economic priorities mean? Thats how a geographer would view Hawaii real estate  as the outward property expression of a societys values, its wants and needs reflected in the decision to plant roots in certain places. Its a lot more than just who lives where. Its digging deeper and understanding that there are real reasons, many of which were not aware of, that determine the decisions we make in real estate. The questions to ponder are: what are these reasons? why do they change? are these changes uniform across Hawaii or are they unique to each island or each town? The next time you find yourself with a nice view over part of whichever island you live on (I hike a lot, so I see lots of birds eye views over Oahu), take a moment and look out over the nearest town, settled area, etc. Try to imagine coloring in different groups (ethnicity, age, job type, etc.) of the photo in your mind and see the landscape for more than just rows of houses and streets. There are reasons that you see the pattern youre seeing.&&&6

Abercrombie Press Secretary Donalyn Dela Cruz told Civil Beat Friday morning that the transition will take place this month. OIP chiefs do not need to be confirmed by the Hawaii Senate.

Council Chairman Has $60,000 Part-Time Job&&&Honolulu City Council Chairman Nestor Garcia told KITV4 News Thursday that he will begin officially declaring that he has a conflict of interest on the rail transit issue when it comes up for votes in the council. Garcia has a $60,000 part-time job mostly funded by pro-rail developers and landowners. Rail transit critic Panos Prevedouros said he thinks the job is meant to influence Garcia.It's a sweet job, sweet job, Prevedouros said.I mean a lot of people in Hawaii would love to have that one. Garcia has been executive director of the Kapolei Chamber of Commerce since early 2009. He said his job includes taking minutes at quarterly chamber meetings, coordinating volunteers and organizing quarterly events, like a luncheon speech by the governor last week at the Ko Olina Resort. shocking... that is all that happens with our politicians conflicts of interest and "pay to play".

Arson suspected as another shark tour boat burns&&&Arson is suspected in a fire which burned a shark tour boat in Haleiwa Harbor last night and damaged an adjacent private boat. HFD firefighters arrived at 11:42 p.m. to find the cabin and deck of the 35-foot commercial shark tour boat in flames. The tour boat was on a trailer in the Haleiwa Harbor trailer yard. Heat from the fire damaged part of a 40-foot private boat on an adjacent trailer, firefighters said. An engine company from the Waialua fire station brought the fire under control at 11:46 p.m. said Fire Department spokesman Capt. Terry Seelig. Damage is estimated at $100,000 to the 35-foot shark tour boat and $20,000 to the 40-foot private boat. The investigation has been turned over to Honolulu police. Seelig said anyone with information is asked to call police or CrimeStoppers. This is the third arson case involving a shark tour boat at Haleiwa Harbor this year.

House Committees Approve Poker Proposal&&&Surprise Amendment Would Allow Poker Tournaments, On-Line Hosting Daryl Huff KITV 4 News Reporter POSTED: 11:25 am HST March 23, 2011 UPDATED: 12:21 pm HST March 23, 2011 [EMAIL: House Committees Approve Poker Proposal ] Email [PRINT: House Committees Approve Poker Proposal ] Print [COMMENTS: House Committees Approve Poker Proposal ] Comments (0) Bookmark and Share HONOLULU -- A proposal that would allow events like the World Series of Poker to take place in a Hawaii hotel or resort was passed in two legislative committees Wednesday. The proposal from House Economic Development Chairman Angus McKelvey allows up to two online poker companies to set up their servers in Hawaii, as long as they only hosted games in which players bet against each other and not against a house. The proposal would not allow ongoing gambling parlors, but only individual poker events approved by a state commission. The online licenses would require a payment of $100 million to the state as well as a portion of the wagers. The gambling events would also pay for the license and be charged a portion of the bets.&&&2

Dig deeper Hawaii..HEARTLESS .DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR HIGHER GAS TAX!!&&&The Honolulu City Council advanced measures to raise the gas tax 30 percent over three years.The city says they need it because the cost of road repairs is going up. But opponents say the cost of gas is already too high. When you pay at the pump in Honolulu, 16.5 cents out of every gallon goes to the city for its share of gas tax. Under a resolution and a bill both moving forward in the City Council, the price would go up to 17.5 cents in July, 19.5 cents in the summer of 2012 and 22.5 cents in July 2013. This would be a 30 percent hike overall. "The city's money situation is bad, but it's the same for all the drivers as well as the commercial transportation industry," said Gareth Sakakid from the Hawaii Transportation Association. On top of that, commercial drivers say they're still reeling from the vehicle weight tax raised last year and again this year to garner 24 million dollars in each year for the city. "We think 48 million, that's a lot of money for the drivers and commercial transportation industry to sustain," Sakakid said. Some lawmakers in support still had reservations about the impact. "The extent of the condition of our roads at this time needs a lot of repairs. We'd like to know how much money is needed for those," Romy Cachola from the Honolulu City Council said. In proposing the tax hike the Mayor said, "The increase is needed to provide funds for growing cost of road maintenance," but lawmakers opposing it question how it would be spent. "We should not at the same time be preparing to reduce the rehabilitation of streets line item in our budget from the 77 million allocation that this council has provided for the last three years to a proposal of this year to, I believe, 45 million dollars," Ikaika Anderson from the Honolulu City Council said. Others say use up any surplus first instead of implementing a hike now, "It's not logical to raise a fuel tax if they're not spending every penny as it stands," Tom Berg from the Honolulu City Council said. Both gas tax hike measures passed just it's first reading today as part of the council's series of budget items. The council has until June 15th to complete the budget.&&&29

City prevails in lawsuit seeking to block rail project to protect burial sites&&&By Minna Sugimoto - bio | email HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow)- An Oahu judge on Wednesday ruled in favor of the city of Honolulu in a lawsuit seeking to block the multi-billion dollar rail transit project. The suit filed by Paulette Kaleikini alleged that the city was violating state laws by failing to complete an archaeological inventory survey -- or AIS -- for the entire 20-mile rail corridor before commencing with the project. The plaintiff argued that without a full assessment, construction activity could disturb and cause irreparable harm to cultural and historic sites, such as native Hawaiian burial grounds. But the city says it is doing the massive project in four segments, and that conducting a separate AIS before the start of each phase is not illegal. The rail project's programmatic agreement requires the city to conduct archaeological field work and then submit a summary report to the Historic Preservation Division of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources for approval, before the final design of each phase. The city says it can make adjustments if the AIS identifies burial sites that could be affected. Circuit Judge Gary Chang ruled that the city is following the law, and that the programmatic agreement provides clear instruction on what to do if there is an inadvertent discovery of human remains after construction has begun. The AIS for the first phase has already been completed. While he sided with the city, the judge hailed the plaintiff for her "enormous contribution" in reminding government officials that our ancestors command respect. "It is the hope of the court that you do not feel defeated today," Judge Chang said. We'll have more on this story on Hawaii News Now beginning at 5:30 PM. On the same Day this story was Also posted: Feds tout Honolulu rail project By Brooks Baehr - bio | email HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow)- The United States Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, all four members of Hawaii's congressional delegation, and Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie met briefly with Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle Wednesday morning to discuss the city's rail transit project. After their meeting Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Senator Dan Inouye, Senator Dan Akaka, U.S. Representative Mazie Hirono, and U.S. Representative Colleen Hanabusa all spoke enthusiastically about the project. "This project is too important at this point for the jobs that will be provided for Hawaiians, for the model transit program that this will create on the island, and I have no doubt that if we continue to communicate and work with the folks here this project will move forward and the people will be the beneficiaries of it," LaHood said. "We've been working on this for over 50 years now and I am certain we are on our way," Inouye added. Honolulu City Council member Breene Harimoto, who chairs the city council's transportation committee, said the council is "very committed to the project, but I need to emphasize that there are growing concerns not only about the money but how things are going." Harimoto told Hawaii News Now he wants to learn more about Ansaldo Honolulu, the company under contract to build the rail line's 80 rail cars and system control center. He plans to visit at least one of the many cities where Ansaldo STS, an Italian based firm, has done rail work. "Preliminary research shows that other cities have had significant issues with that particular vendor, so we haven't done our full homework yet, but I think it raises enough questions and concerns that the council feels we need to investigate," Harimoto said.&&&2

Romney would use Executive Power to repeal ObamaCare&&&ROMNEY 2012!!! "If I were president, on Day One I would issue an executive order paving the way for Obamacare waivers to all 50 states. The executive order would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and all relevant federal officials to return the maximum possible authority to the states to innovate and design health-care solutions that work best for them. As I have stated time and again, a one-size-fits-all national plan that raises taxes is simply not the answer. Under our federalist system, the states are laboratories of democracy. They should be free to experiment. By the way, what works in one state may not be the answer for another. Of course, the ultimate goal is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with free-market reforms that promote competition and lower health-care costs. But since an outright repeal would take time, an executive order is the first step in returning power to the states."&&&12

Obama - The Liberal's Party Boi&&&All he wants to do is party, vacation and play golf... Obamas most self-indulgent moment was broadcast on national television this week when, in the midst of numerous crises crying out for American leadership, he took time to film his picks for the NCAA basketball tournament brackets for broadcast by the ESPN sports network. This follows a two-year string of self-indulgences by Obama since he became president that has demonstrated to the world that nothing comes before Obamas me-time. Most famously, Obama did not interrupt his 2009 luxury Christmas vacation in Hawaii when an Islamist terrorist tried to blow a passenger jet out of the sky over Detroit on Christmas Day. Obama could barely be moved to speak to the nation about the attack which came within a failed detonator of succeeding. Now, with the Middle East in flames and Americas closest Asian ally teetering on collapse from the triple-whammy of a 9.0 earthquake, subsequent apocalytic tsunami and multiple nuclear power plant failures, Obama has spent his time golfing, partying with the press, fundraising, hanging out with athletes, prepping for his NCAA brackets presentation and getting ready for the Obama family taxpayer funded Spring Break trip to Rio de Janeiro this weekend. The White House Web site proudly displays Obamas picks for the mens and womens tournaments. You, the U.S. taxpayer, paid for the posting and hosting of Obamas picks in pdf format.&&&80
Obama couldn't care less&&&If the world is in crisis, you wouldnt know it by watching President Obamas spring break. Between golf, basketball and the presidents upcoming trip to Rio de Janeiro, the White House is projecting a disinterested aura of business as usual. For this administration,tuned-out is the new normal. The Mideast crisis is continuing, and Hillary Rodham Clinton has been the one taking the 3 a.m. phone calls. The secretary of state has been dealing with political reform in Egypt, a military crackdown in Bahrain and the continuing civil war in Libya. However, she is hampered by a chief executive who cant make up his mind which course of action would best secure his place in history. Its no wonder she took the opportunity to tell CNN she had no interest in continuing in the job in a theoretical Obama second term. For the presidents part, he did manage to squeeze in a phone call to the kings of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia to express his deep concern over the violence in Bahrain and stress the importance of a political process as the only way to peacefully address the legitimate grievances of Bahrainis. After this exercise in talking-point leadership, Bahrains crackdown continued apace. Mr. Obamas views simply dont matter to a world that views him as weak. The news from Japan grows direr as the nuclear crisis intensifies. The Obama administration has shown considerably less interest in responding to this disaster - actually three disasters: earthquake, tsunami and potential nuclear meltdown - than it did to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. This is strange given the possibility for a monumental nuclear catastrophe and destabilizing the worlds third-largest economy, which also happens to be one of Americas best friends. A radioactive plume is set to hit the U.S. West Coast on Friday, and on Thursday President Obama said - twice - that we do not expect harmful levels of radition to reach the U.S.Either way, it certainly wont pose a threat to the president, who by this weekend will be safe with his family on Brazils beaches. Congress continued to debate a stopgap federal budget during the week, and on Tuesday the national debt scored a one-day $72 billion jump. Given the critical importance of the debate, it would be reasonable to expect Mr. Obama to be working hard to find a way out of the fiscal mess he largely created. The president, predictably, was nowhere to be found. Sen. Joe Manchin, West Virginia Democrat, scored the president for his failure to lead on the budget issue, and Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, said the president was absent from this debate. Vice President Joe Biden, who was supposed to be representing the White House in the congressional budget wrangle, instead took a trip to Russia. None of this is meant to suggest Mr. Obama hasnt been productive. He laughed it up at the Gridiron Club dinner, took a stand against schoolyard bullying and spoke on the radio about Womens History Month. Over the weekend, he played his 61st round of golf as president and finalized his March Madness bracket picks, predictably avoiding controversy by choosing the four top seeds for the Final Four. On Monday, he attended a gathering of potential big-money donors at the St. Regis hotel that Democratic Party officials insisted was not a fundraiser. Sure, it was not a fundraiser; and the White House isnt coming across as disconnected, weak, passive and paralyzed either.&&&30

Teachers willing to return for restored furlough days - Hawaii ...&&&A welcome sign of progress to end this Furlough Friday Failure that earned condemnation from across this nation, and from no less than Hawaii's own President Obama himself, in addition to international ridicule and scorn from throughout the world. In looking for funds to raid, the Rainy Day Fund should not be the only source. Governor Lingle also owes a duty to the People of Hawaii that includes advising and consulting with her AG Bennett about the Hawaii Supreme Court decision in the Superferry case, where the High Court stated the Legislature cannot pass "Special Acts" that are not applied uniformally througout Hawaii. Such is the case of the .5% GE rail tax that gouges only Oahu tax-payers. Reportedly, the scheme entails allowing all counties to raise a .5% GE tax for transit, HOWEVER, it is disparate, AS APPLIED, when only Oahu residents are subjected to this polite form of extortion, under threat of prosecution of State of Hawaii law for not complying. The State collected it. The State can prosecute for failure to pay it, and it is the State of Hawaii that holds that money. Having the Power to Collect that .5% GE tax, the State also holds the Power to Spend it on a priority more pressing than what has clearly developed into a make work project for the politically connected. There is no other top priority than insuring the next generation of Hawaii's leaders have the tools and resources that tax payers place high and above a train that goes nowhere to enrich a whole bunch of no-good, no-bodies, hanging around Mufi. Rail Fund: Raid it.&&&68

Hawaii politics&&&Mike G. H. Chun Email: chunmike@hotmail.com October 16, 2010 Professor Calvin Pang William S. Richardson School of Law University of Hawaii at Manoa Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 USA Cal, Hey, old buddy! In a few days, I will cast my absentee ballot by mail. It is with enthusiasm that will cast my ballot for Congressman Charles Djou for CD-1/Hawaii. His energy will illuminate the U.S. House of Representatives. Of course, in the race for Hawaii Governor, I will be voting for Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona. They say that this is the last political campaign for me. Its been nearly 33 years of Hawaii politics for me. Im just so tired. For years, I have been plagued by persistent & lingering fatigue. It is otherwise known popularly as burnout. I would say its closer to emotional exhaustion. Since Fall 1964, when we first met in the parking lot playground of Saint Theresas School as 5th graders, we have both pursued careers in government & politics. As you know, we both chose conservative paths. In the years since my initial involvement in 1978, I have witnessed the blurring of the dichotomy between the two major national political parties. Democrats continue to gradually move to the Right with the Political Dance of Life. Surprisingly, the Republicans have moved even further to the Right with the nascent TEA Party movement. In the 1978 Ariyoshi for Governor campaign, the grassroots coordinator briefed me on the Right-Center orientation of the mainstream Hawaii Democrat faction. A couple of years later, my Hawaii politics professor at UH Manoa indicated to me that UH Manoa CBA (College of Business Administration) was dominated by Japanese-Americans who were pursuing conservative business oriented paths. Within a decade, it became obvious to me that Hawaii would soon undergo Transformation. Political science UH Manoa lecturer/instructor Patsy Mink indicated in 1979, that the liberal initiatives of the 1960s were largely dismantled on the national level. In retrospect, the globalization initiatives of the Clinton 1 administration have supported an acceleration of off shoring, which is gratifying to acquisitive American big business. USA industry has shifted into transnational ventures linking our country with a thickening web of enterprise interests. The continuing expansionistic imperialism since the founding of America is obvious to me now. We are clearly fully engaged in creating a vast petroleum & opium empire abroad. The twin crisis with China & Iran has demonstrated that more USA military adventures overseas are on the horizon. Stuxnet cyber warfare can quickly bring our foreign rivals to their knees with pinpoint accuracy. American surrogates in South Korea, Taiwan, & Japan play a supportive role in justifying militaristic posturing towards the Peoples Republic of China. 200 mile EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone)[United Nations Law of the Sea] conflicts in the Arctic & Asian rims threaten fossil fuel resource wars for oil & natural gas. And at home, domestic internal security apparatus grows with increasing paranoia. But there is an alternative to more perpetual warfare. The GlobalFed nation which I once proposed is under discussion by the Global Plutocracy. With the thickening web of connections with the rise of globalism, blocs of nations can being to merge. Although this concept is not inevitable, decoupling is not likely. There have been periods of relative localization (e.g. Great Depression). And emergent Peak Oil does threaten a return to localization. But in the Information Revolution, we live in a shrinking Planet. Militarism & imperialism are again on the rise in America. Does George W. Bush really run the Obama White House? Can we avert more perpetual warfare? Do we have to continue to live under a constant war footing since December 7, 1941? Only time will tell.

Obama - The INVISIBLE little man, anti-leadership amid world crises&&&Where is the president? The world is beset. Moammar Khadafy is moving relentlessly to crush the Libyan revolt that once promised the overthrow of one of the world's most despicable regimes. So where is the president? Japan may be on the verge of a disaster that dwarfs any we have yet seen. A self-governing nation like the United States needs its leader to take full measure of his position at times of crises when the path forward is no longer clear. This is not a time for leadership; this is the time for leadership. So where is Barack Obama? The moment demands that he rise to the challenge of showing America and the world that he is taking the reins. How leaders act in times of unanticipated crisis, in which they do not have a formulated game plan and must instead navigate in treacherous waters, defines them. Obama is defining himself in a way that will destroy him. It is not merely that he isn't rising to the challenge. He is avoiding the challenge. He is Bartleby the President. He would prefer not to. He has access to a microphone 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If he tells the broadcast networks in the middle of the day that he has a major address to deliver on an unprecedented world situation, they will cancel their programming for him. And yet, since Friday and a press conference in which he managed to leave the American position on Libya more muddled than it was before, we have not heard his voice. Except in a radio address -- he talked about education legislation. And he appeared at a fund-raiser in DC. And sat down with ESPN to reveal his NCAA picks.&&&13

At any rate, which part of EMERGENCY reserves does he not understand??...It's so obvious, his real intent is to drain the reserves so in case of a REAL, dire emergency...it's bone dry and were fcked&&&6

Gulan Cult infiltrating our charter schools&&&A Muslim religious movement wants to conquer America. In fact, in a sense it has already conquered and no one has yet noticed. Nothing to do with al-Qaeda, terrorism or Islamic fundamentalism. We speak of a sect that is rather mysterious - so much so that it has been called the Muslim Opus Dei - founded in Turkey in the 1970s by an imam named Fethullah Glen. And noted rather for its moderation. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Gulens followers opened dozens of schools in Central Asia. From there, the network of Gulenist schools has spread across all of Asia and in many African countries with the aim of forming a new ruling class tied to Turkey and the Gulen movement. Eleven years ago, to escape the military, Gulen relocated from Turkey to a spiritual center in Pennsylvania that is two hours from New York. Since then, his movement, known among followers simply as "the Service" - Hizmet in Turkish  have opened a flurry of schools in the U.S.. The difference is that it is being done at the expense of American taxpayers. Il Sole 24 Ore has been able to determine that for months, the FBI, Department of Justice and Department of Education have been investigating the possible illegal use of these education funds, a criminal conspiracy, extortion, and violation of immigration laws. "The suspicion is that, behind an educational effort, there is a giant conspiracy" a federal officer, requesting anonymity, explained to our newspaper. "The plan is as simple as it is brilliant: to use public funding for schools to educate a new generation of Americans favorably inclined to Turkey and thus indirectly to the Gulen movement, and also to spend some of that money to fund foundations and cultural centers." Federal authorities have identified at least 120 schools opened in recent years by the movement in some twenty U.S. states, all charter schools, which are outside the loop of public education but financed by states and the federal government. Since each of these schools receives from 1.5 to 3 million dollars each year in public funds, it is a matter of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.&&&20

Regime ends Three strikes law&&&Not surprising in the soft on crime, soft on criminals DEMOCRAT run state where violent heinous crimes are on the rise!! Hawaii's three-strikes law was touted as a way to make the community safer, but since its passage nearly five years ago, the statute has been used only once and is now destined to quietly expire this summer. Hawaii's 'habitual felons' law The state "three-strikes" law was adopted in 2006 but has only been used once at sentencing. The law expires July 1. It allows prosecutors to seek a prison term of at least 30 years to life for a third violent felony conviction. The felon would not be eligible for parole until he or she has served a minimum term of 30 years or more set by the judge. Violent felonies include murder, manslaughter, first-degree assault, kidnapping, first- and second-degree sexual assault, first- and second-degree robbery, continuous sexual assault of a minor and first-degree burglary. The 2006 law mandates a sentence of at least 30 years to life for a third conviction for a violent offense. Since it was adopted, the law was used to sentence a man who pleaded guilty to murder and agreed to be sentenced under the law because he wanted to avoid an even harsher prison term. Former city Prosecutor Peter Carlisle and former Attorney General Mark Bennett campaigned for the measure. Carlisle, now Honolulu mayor, said he still thinks it is a useful tool to deal with the most violent, dangerous criminals. But the current city prosecutor and the acting attorney general aren't pushing to keep the law alive beyond July 1, when it is scheduled to sunset.&&&1
Homeless evicted again from Kea'au beach park in Makaha.&&&Not everyone that is homeless are drug/alcohol users, some are hard working people that just can't afford to pay for the crazy amounts of rent, electric bill, water bill, etc.... that goes with renting or buying a home. I saw it coming, told my wife days ago... "watch whats gonna happen, this dumb S reporters goes to Makaha to interview the homeless a couple of weeks ago and the city and county will take action by kicking them out of their makeshift tents/homes". And sure enough. A lot of these homeless people band together for protection from local hoods, they are like little communities in theirselves. For some of these homeless, its a God given right for them to be there at the beaches where they were raised. I was taught to live off of the ocean when I was a little kid back in the 60's and Kea'au beach, all the way to Kaena point were our harvesting grounds. We often stayed at the beach for months and lived a good healthy life. There were many local families that did the same. I remember Kupuna's used to have shacks at Makua beach and we didn't know who they were but it was automatically every families obligation that fished there, to share the catch with these elderly people, all the families that came fishing did it. It was an unspoken duty that all Hawaiian families shared way back then. In the 70's - 80's, a Huge community of homeless people was living there and they took care of each other. The homeless was rarely seen in Honolulu at that time, but the next thing we know, the homeless was forced out to make way for progress.... "BullShit", they (State) just couldn't stand the fact that people was living in harmony and living there free. Even the Kupuna's was kicked out. Some of these people lived their 50-60 years and they were put out. Makua beach and up into Makua valley was once a thriving fishing village back in ancient times and the roots of many of the local people living on the waianae coast are originated from that village. When they kicked out the homeless, where do you think they ended up? Thats right. A lot of them relocated to honolulu....... I say leave them be.... who the hell goes to kea'au beach park anyway.... only the stupid tour guides would take people way the hell down there where there is no thru traffic.... and oh yeah the military.... thats more crap that the State is doing. These foriengers, they're the people that I know who would go into some one's and claim that they have discovered it first.....Lol, well... thats what they did when Columbus discoverd America. How in the hell do you discover a place that's already discovered? Leave the people alone, its not only the Kanaka Maoli that's homeless, go look and you'll be suprised.&&&1

Abercrombie will raise the GET after he promised not to&&&AND HES SHIFTING THE BLAME ON HAWAII RESIDENTS. WHAAAAT?? After campaigning on a promise not to raise taxes and specifically not to raise the GE Tax, Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie this week has promised to sign any GE Tax hike approved by the Legislature. Abercrombie says it is up to the legislature to decide if some want to benefit at the expense of others. And he is blaming the public for not rallying behind his proposed pension tax and Medicare Part B cuts without which he says every bodys taxes will go sky-high. A recently released Democrat-run Peoples Pulse poll shows 68% oppose GE Tax hikeincluding 49% who strongly oppose a GE Tax hike. But the news of Abercrombies latest broken campaign promise is drawing the slimmest media attention.&&&69

Isle population up to 1.4M&&&"Hawaii's population grew by about 8.8 percent to 1,360,301 people, with Hawaii and Maui counties seeing the largest jumps over the past decade, according to 2010 census data released this week. Hawaii island's population grew by 36,402 to 185,079, a 24.5 percent jump. On Maui the population grew by 26,740 to 154,834, a 20.9 percent jump." the article hints that though more numbers on the outer islands may get more true representation in office it still s unlikely to happen. the folks in charge will make sure the districts are spread out over an area wher they still will have the "asian" majority that votes them in. "Asians still make up the largest chunk of the state, taking up 38.6 percent of the population with about 525,100 people. There are about 135,400 native Hawaiians in the state and about 336,600 whites. Blacks saw the only decrease. There are 2.6 percent fewer blacks in Hawaii, with about 21,400, down from 22,000 in 2000."&&&6
It's a Sad, Sorry Day in Hawaii...major Trouble in Paradise&&&Thanks to the sheeple's new governor, the radical 60's hippy from New York....Hawaii is officially now the Gay Capital of the nation, millions of gays will flock here....girls will be boys and boys will be girls... DONT BLAME ME I VOTED FOR THE LOCAL HAWAIIAN CHRISTIAN BRUDDAH WHO FIRMLY BELIEVES MARRIAGE IS THAT BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN... Less than a year after seeing the push for civil unions vetoed, gay rights advocates cheered as Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed into law a bill legalizing civil unions and making Hawaii the seventh state to grant such privileges to same-sex couples. Abercrombie signed the legislation at a ceremony today at historic Washington Place. "E Komo Mai: It means all are welcome," Abercrombie said in remarks before signing the bill into law. "This signing today of this measure says to all of the world that they are welcome. That everyone is a brother or sister here in paradise." "The legalization of civil unions in Hawaii represents in my mind equal rights for all people," he said. The ceremony was broadcast live on television and the Internet as Abercrombie, a Democrat who campaigned on a promise to sign the bill if it reached his desk, reversed the decision made by his Republican predecessor. Not everyone was thrilled with the new law. "It's a sad day for the people of Hawaii," said Sen. Mike Gabbard. "Politicians have shown that they just don't care about the views and values of the majority of Hawaii's residents."&&&8

Curing cancer | starbulletin.com | News | /2008/02/09/&&&Cancer was cured in the Mid-1700's in Europe and from 1912-1959 in the USA. Because the successful cure is by Diet, the American Medical Association, FDA and the various Cancer Societies are not interested in the real cure or prevention. CANCER CAUSED BY DIET DEFICIENCY Everyone should know that The WAR on Cancer is largely FRAUD, Linus Pauling Dr Royal Raymond Rife (1888-1971) discovered the cause of cancer and other diseases. Rife was able to destroy disease with Radio Waves after discovering their destructive frequencies by watching them through microscopes he invented. The work Rife performed in eliminating Cancer and other diseases has not been duplicated. His microscopes have never been duplicated by any other, which could view and photograph viruses, bacteria and fungi in the living state. Harry Hoxsey (1901-1974), cured many cancer patients using an herbal remedy reportedly handed down by his great-grandfather. By the 1950's, the Hoxsey Cancer Clinic in Dallas was the world's largest private cancer center, with branches in seventeen states. Hoxsey opened his clinic in Mexico after the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), American Medical Association (AMA) and the Pharmaceutical Industry conspired against his work. Hoxsey cured some of the worst known internal and external Cancers in the USA. In Mexico today the Hoxsey Clinic is called the Bio-Medical Center. William F. Koch, Ph. D., M. D.(1885-1967) not only cured Cancer, he wrote “CANCER ITS FUNCTION AND CURE, THE EVOLUTION OF THE IMMUNITY PROCESS” in 1925. Koch like many successful doctors, working in the best interest of Humanity was despised by the FDA, AMA and the Pharmaceutical Industry for his accomplishments in curing Cancer and other degenerative diseases for pennies on the dollar. His work can be found on the Internet. Dr. Max Gerson (1881-1959) developed the Gerson therapy, an alternative therapy for Cancer and most chronic, degenerative diseases. Before he died, he tested himself which confirmed that he had been poisoned by arsenic. The Gerson Institute is a non-profit organization located in San Diego, California, dedicated to the alternative, non-toxic treatment of disease, using the Gerson Therapy. Gerson also cured many lives of Cancer. Otto Heinrich Warburg (1883-1970)(biochemist) won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in1931 and wrote “The Prime Cause & Prevention of Cancer” The prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen ... in normal body cells by fermentation of sugar. Warburg wrote this in 1966 long after Dr Koch had completely identified the Cause and Cure of Cancer by 1925. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. During 1950 after many years of research a dedicated biochemist by the name of Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. isolated a new vitamin that he numbered B-17 and called 'Laetrile'. Cancer basically needs Sugar, Fermentation and Low Oxygen environment to survive.&&&3

No More Boom Boom?&&&Hawaii lawmakers consider outlawing big or powerful aftermarket auto speakers, subwoofers or amplifiers. Legislators will consider a bill today banning the sale of loud speakers and amplified subwoofers in cars. "It's really those real large big booming subwoofers that ... literally cause your walls and windows to shake. We've all experienced that," said Rep. Marcus Oshiro (D, Wahiawa-Whitmore Village), author of House Bill 1178, scheduled to be heard this morning in the House Transportation Committee. "That's where your own personal freedom to enjoy your music conflicts or oppresses a person's right to enjoy the quietness of their own home." The bill prohibits the installation, ownership or use of any car with aftermarket speakers over 6.5 inches in height or depth, any five-speaker aftermarket system or any speaker of more than 100 watts. The bill mandates a fine of up to $250 per violation. Although it bans the use of any product that wasn't installed by the vehicle manufacturer, Oshiro said the bill's intent is not to ban iPods or other electronic devices. "We see this as an attack directly at small businesses," said Carmina Ahmed, co-owner of Car Stereo Express in Aiea, who has organized an online campaign to stop the bill. "It's not just us. It's a ripple effect. Let's punish the people who do it. Not everybody who buys the subwoofer is going to boom it." Ahmed said there is already a city ordinance that makes it unlawful to play a vehicle's stereo system when it is audible from 30 feet away. The Honolulu ordinance has fines of between $100 and $1,000. Honolulu police handed out 912 citations under the ordinance last year, up from 607 in 2009 and 649 in 2008, according to court records.

Although Iwamoto did not respond to a request for an interview, his public statements indicate he is already using the issue of school bullying in an attempt to create a culture in Hawai`i Schools where gays and transsexuals are lionized as icons and heroes while the military is denigrated and students inclined to choose a military career are humiliated.

Hawaii Real Estate - Aloha or Technology?&&&I just posted a random thought on one of my sites. You can check it out here: Basically, I feel that Hawaii is more relationship-driven and less technology-driven than the real estate industries in most other states. i don't know if this is good, bad or neither. But after some time in the business here, it's my opinion that technology isn't quite relied upon as much in the islands. I'm speaking in comparative / relative terms, not absolute terms as everyone uses the internet for everything these days. But I think Hawaii balances the two differently than our mainland counterparts. Please read the post and leave comments. Thank you and ALOHA&&&1

Professor accuses UH of Anti-americanism and vet bashing&&&UH Manoa Anti-Americans place E-W Center funding at risk In a series of posts on Obama administration National Endowment for the Humanities Chairman Jim Leach, we have followed the descent of the NEH into political partisanship and rank buffoonery. Now we turn to problematic programming funded by the NEH. In July 2010 the NEH sponsored a workshop for college professors at the East-West Center, University of Hawaii. The title of the conference was "History and Commemoration: The Legacies of the Pacific War." As one of the 25 American scholars chosen to attend the workshop, Professor Penelope Blake anticipated an opportunity to visit hallowed sites such as Pearl Harbor, the Arizona Memorial and the Punchbowl Cemetery and engage with scholars who share her interest in studying this often neglected part of World War II history. Instead, Professor Blake was treated to the most disturbing experience of her academic career, a conference which she found to be driven by an overt political bias and a blatant anti-American agenda.&&&2
GOP bans funding for ObamaCare, Planned Parenthood and PBS&&&THE GROWN UPS TAKE OVER NOW.... In a remarkable afternoon of floor activity, House Republicans voted to defund ObamaCare on Friday, starving the program of federal funds through the end of 2011. Republican congressman Denny Rehberg of Montana, whose amendment killed the ObamaCare funding, declared that Today's vote is the latest victory for the American public and our country in preventing the disastrous ObamaCare law from forever damaging our health care system and hampering job creation, and hailed Republican efforts as saving billions of wasted funding while opening the door to true health care reform that reduces costs and improves access. Another big winner today was Indiana Representative Mike Pence, whose amendment to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood passed 240-185. The move will cost Planned Parenthood more than $75 million per year, a shortfall it will need to make up by dramatically increasing the prices it charges to pimps for business consulting services. This afternoons vote is a victory for taxpayers, and a victory for life, Fox News quoted Pence.By banning federal funding to Planned Parenthood, Congress has taken a stand for millions of Americans who believe their tax dollars should not be used to subsidize the largest abortion provider in America. Still awaiting a stay of execution is PBS, which saw its $460 million in funding cut out of the House continuing budget resolution. An amendment to restore funding is still awaiting a vote, prompting angry Muppets to leave their billion-dollar merchandising empire and storm Capitol Hill yesterday. Fortunately, the Muppets dispersed peacefully before Capitol Hill police had to use tear gas, or ask uncomfortable questions about why every new Muppet is a shrill annoyance who makes parents want to swallow their own tongues to escape the sound of his voice. The spending cut bonanza did have its limits, as the House refused about $22 billion in requested cuts, leaving the total slashed from the budget at $60 billion for the remaining seven months of the governments budget year.&&&4

Should Hawaii Institute a Foreclosure Moratorium?&&&I read an interesting article in yesterdays Honolulu Star-Advertiser (I still keep screwing up the name since the merger). It discussed the possibility of a five-month moratorium on Hawaii foreclosures statewide. Immediately my brain started working overdrive trying to come up with the possible scenarios that could unfold from this course of action. My final take is that I think it is ultimately misguided. A foreclosure moratorium is based on the idea that there are mortgages being foreclosed upon that should not happen. A typical foreclosure occurs when the homeowner generally: 1. didnt qualify for a loan modification 2. fell out of loan mod status 3. could not refinance 4. made no attempt to reinstate the loan with back payments 5. could not afford modified loan payments 6. could not successfully complete a short sale 7. made no attempt to do anything 8. just could no longer afford the payments for any other reason (payments spiked, job loss, etc.) Now an improper foreclosure, like the kind Im assuming to be the target of a moratorium, would be one where: 1. the lender failed to accept a reasonable short sale offer 2. the lender failed to properly process a short sale or loan modification package (fairly common with the bureaucracies and size of lenders processing departments) 3. the lender realized they would make more money on a foreclosure than by working with the homeowner on a short sale or loan modification 4. homeowner could not get any reasonable form of customer service while the property was simultaneously headed to trustee sale Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but it makes a point.... The full article is right here:&&&5

Hawaii Banning Toy Guns&&&Idiots!!! Hawaii Democrat introduces bill to ban sale of toy guns to minors A bill introduced by a Hawaii Democrat would ban the sale of toy guns to minors in that state, according to an article at The Blaze. If state Representative Scott Saiki (pronounced "psyche") has his way, anyone who intentionally sells a squirt gun to anyone under the age of 18 could face penalties of 90 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $2000. Hes the democratic pro-smoking ban, pro-union, pro-tax increase state rep from the Moiliili, McCully, Kaimuki district. The bill was introduced in late January and passed its first reading on Jan 24. It has been referred to the Judiciary committee, but no hearings have been scheduled as of this writing. The law introduced by Saiki would not be the first such ban. Edmond, OK passed a law in 2009 banning toy guns altered to look like real firearms. Anyone caught in that town with such a toy could face a penalty of $244 and anyone threatening another person with such a toy would face a fine of up to $544. In April, 2009 Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe signed a similar law banning toy guns that look like real firearms. But Saiki's proposed legislation makes no distinction between an obvious toy (like a SuperSoaker) and a toy altered to look like a real weapon. The intent appears clear - sell a toy gun to a 6-year-old; go to jail. Perhaps Hawaii has a problem with black-market toy guns no one else knows about, or Saiki thinks toy guns are a "gateway" to purchases of AK-47's.&&&82

AZ Rancher Ordered to Pay Damages to Illegals&&&TUCSON, Ariz.- A federal appeals court has upheld a 2009 ruling against an Arizona rancher related to his assault on illegal immigrants in 2004. The Arizona Daily Star reported Friday the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that Roger Barnett must pay about $87,000 in damages. What a strange country we live in today where criminal invaders have more rights than citizens. Our own government goes out of the way to assist in their criminal behavior and even reward them.

No Hawaii Beverage Tax!!&&&ALERT: THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE IS VOTING ON TAXING SODA AND OTHER BEVERAGES ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14. NOW IS THE TIME TO TELL YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO LEAVE OUR GROCERY BUDGETS ALONE! The people of Hawaii are making ends meet in this difficult economy. Yet some politicians in Honolulu are considering a new tax that singles out soft drinks and other beverages. Now is not the right time to raise taxes on hard-working families. The Aloha State is a great place to live  but we already pay huge amounts in taxes, especially when you consider the general excise tax. Adding to our tax burden now is a bad idea. With high unemployment and a lagging economy, lawmakers should focus on policies that promote business and grow jobs. We said no to a soda tax last year  and we say no again this year. Singling out sodas, teas, sports drinks and other beverages for a tax is discriminatory and regressive. It will hurt the most those who can least afford it. No Hawaii Beverage Tax is a group of concerned citizens, families, businesses and community organizations who want to send a strong message to our elected officials that we reject any discriminatory tax proposals on common grocery items like beverages. Tell the legislators that government should trim its own budget and leave our grocery budgets alone.&&&5

The resolution makes no bones about the fact that it is money-motivated. Given the substantial amount of business between the US and China, it would be especially anti-democratic for a governmental body to make that type of threat. Nobody told us that the Hawaii-China tourism trade includes the importation of Chinas anti-democratic political system.&&&24

I am the democratic Liberal-Progressive's Worst Nightmare&&&THINK THIS GUY HAS IT ALL COVERED. I COULDNT SPOT ANYTHING HE LEFT OUT. I Am the Democratic Liberal-Progressives Worst Nightmare. I am a White, Conservative, Tax-Paying, American Veteran, Gun Owning Biker. I am a Master leatherworker. I work hard and long hours with my hands to earn a living. I believe in God and the freedom of religion, but I dont push it on others. I ride Harley Davidson Motorcycles and drive American-made cars, and I believe in American products and buy them whenever I can. I believe the money I make belongs to me and not some liberal governmental functionary, Democratic or Republican, that wants to share it with others who dont work! Im in touch with my feelings and I like it that way! I think owning a gun doesnt make you a killer; it makes you a smart American. I think being a minority does not make you noble or victimized, and does not entitle you to anything. Get over it! I believe that if you are selling me a Big Mac or any other item, you should do it in English. I believe there should be no other language option. I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God when and where they want to. My heroes are Malcolm Forbes, Bill Gates, John Wayne, Babe Ruth, Roy Rogers, and Willie G. Davidson, who makes the awesome Harley Davidson Motorcycles. I dont hate the rich. I dont pity the poor. I know wrestling is fake and I dont waste my time watching or arguing about it. Ive never owned a slave, nor was I a slave. I havent burned any witches or been persecuted by the Turks, and neither have you! I believe if you dont like the way things are here, go back to where you came from and change your own country! This is AMERICA We like it the way it is and more so the way it was so stop trying to change it to look like Russia or China or some other socialist country! If you were born here and dont like it, youre free to move to any Socialist country that will have you. I believe it is time to really clean house, starting with the White House, the seat of our biggest problems. I want to know which church is it, exactly, where the Reverend Jesse Jackson preaches, where he gets his money, and why he is always part of the problem and not the solution? Can I get an AMEN on that one? I also think the cops have the right to pull you over if youre breaking the law, regardless of what color you are, but not just because you happen to ride a bike. And, no, I dont mind having my face shown on my drivers license. I think its good And Im proud that God is written on my money. I think if you are too stupid to know how a ballot works, I dont want you deciding who should be running the most powerful nation in the world for the next four years. I dislike those people standing in the intersections trying to sell me stuff or trying to guilt me into making donations to their cause Get a job and do your part to support yourself and your family! I believe that it doesnt take a village to raise a child, it takes two parents I believe illegal is illegal no matter what the lawyers think! I believe the American flag should be the only one allowed in AMERICA ! If this makes me a BAD American, then yes, Im a BAD American. We want our country back! I hope this offends all illegal aliens. My great, great, great, great grandfather watched and bled as his friends died in the Revolution & the War of 1812.

Aiona, the most righteous leader since Queen Liliuokalani???&&&Aiona tries to dampen GOP head's religious call By Derrick DePledge Honolulu Star Advertiser POSTED: 01:30 a.m. HST, Aug 31, 2010 Lt. Gov. James "Duke" Aiona acknowledged yesterday that comments from the state Republican Party chairman about Aiona's appeal among religious conservatives could be seen as divisive and said he is running for governor to serve all the people of Hawaii. Jonah Kaauwai, state GOP chairman, sent a forceful letter to pastors and others asking them not to vote for former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann in the Democratic primary for governor. Hannemann, a Mormon, has reached out to religious conservatives in his primary against former U.S. Rep. Neil Abercrombie. Kaauwai, in a letter that was posted on the Hawaii Christian Coalition website, said people of faith should stay with Aiona, a Catholic, in the GOP primary and the November general election. "Duke will win because the Church has been behind him the entire time operating in the POWER and the AUTHORITY of the NAME OF JESUS!" Kaauwai wrote. "We are the HEAD and not the tail; we are the VICTORS not the victims! "If Duke Aiona does not win it will be the burden of the Body of Christ to bear so rather than preparing to have to deal with either Mufi or Neil winning the Church, we should be preparing for Duke to WIN. Neither Mufi Hannemann nor Neil Abercrombie is righteous and a vote for either in the primary or general election is succumbing to fear and advancing unrighteousness!" Aiona, in a statement, said he would appeal to all people regardless of their faith. "While faith is a central part of my life, I'm running for governor to serve all the people of Hawaii -- regardless of their religion," he said. "The goal of our grassroots campaign is to connect with every citizen in every community of this great state, and chairman Kaauwai's personal comments are seen by many as divisive. "Our campaign is focused on families, friends and neighbors of all backgrounds, and we're going to continue to reach out to all the citizens of Hawaii."&&&34

Gas Boycott&&&Gas prices are too high. When I go to the pups I am insulated. It lets me know I am not smart enough to stop this kind of thievery. I just have to pay it right? No I have always been a bit of a rebel, but I know when I am being screwed. First the government then the Insurance Companies with Seat belts and cigarettes. Now the oil guys are giving it a try. As I heard one say. Peopled only have so mush money and we need to get as much of it as fast as we can before someone else does. People are creatures of habits and they will pay whatever we ask. Besides, they are going to spend it somewhere. That is not a quote. It has been sometime when I head it. It no doubt was true. Cause if they charged $10 a gallon we would still buy it. Right? How does it feel to be so stupid? I feel like a fool every time I go to the pumps. It is time we do something to redeem our dignity. It can only get worse. If we let it. Saturday July 1st, 2006 has been chosen as the official day or protest. One full day of no convinces store sales at all and no fuel sales. We are not trying to hurt the oil economy. We do however want them to realize we do have the power to do so. We are not fools. We can only take so mush. To double the price of gas in only a few months is insane. We have oil fields still shut down from the 70s. As I remember we shut them down as a matter of diplomacy. We wanted to deal with the Middle East. Wonder who got the kick back on that one. I was there when Ashland Oil entertained the oil barrens of the Middle East in Ashland KY. I was in Florida when we entertained the Shaw of Iran. What went wrong there? Now we are to believe that weather is reasonable for higher gas prices. And that we now control most of the Middle East with a war machine to rival Armageddon and we have to pay double for gas. As my mother would say.I dont believe a word of it. If you told it to a mule he would kick you brains out. Our leader President Gorge W. Bush, an oilman, insults me. Who tells us we have to live with higher fuel prices. How stupid does he think we are? I for one am not buying his story. Bill Clinton would have never tried to sell us such a crock of bull. So to show my disbelief. I will not purchase any oil products on Saturday July, 1,2006. I will not stop at any convenience markets where gas is sold. I am not saying not purchase what you need the day before or after. I am only doing this as a protest. I know we can get the attention of the President and the oil business if they have no or very little sales on this day. I know I would start thinking what is next if I was in that position. Wouldnt you? So as a form of protest I am inviting everyone to join in with me to show our unity in this protest. Remember If we dont do something Fuel prices are just going up and up. AS soon as we get used to the price hike, it will happen again. Join me in this protest. We can make a difference Gas Boycott July 1st, 2006 Fight back now Dont stop at convince stores for anything What is our business really worth? Lower Gas Prices? Lets find out. Show your support, wear your pledge on your chest. T-Shirts and other show your support items available at&&&5

The current occupant of the White House has only himself to blame&&&After the current occupant of the White House spent two years demonizing profits and profit makers in the private sector, after he spent two years sowing a wide swath of market fear and uncertainty that prevented business executives from FORMULATING -- much less EXECUTING -- any sort of a business plan, NOW he expects them to roll over and do his bidding just so he can claim credit for bringing down the very unemployment HE caused in the first place with his chaotic and unpredictably reckless policies? GET REAL! These same publicly despised "rich" business leaders now have the current occupant over a barrel and they are continuing to make profits in spite of layoffs and massive uncertainty. How? By painfully and massively increasing the productivity of those employees fortunate enough NOT to have been laid off. This phenomenal productivity has resulted in the current jobless recovery. As a result business executives are sitting on a mountain of cash with little or no incentive to increase their payroll by hiring more people in the current ambience of fear and uncertainty created by the witless current occupant of the White House with the huge chip on his shoulder. Having thus been so badly AND SO PUBLICLY maligned by the current occupant, they would at this juncture be damned fools to let this fool in the White House fool them into taking his "offer" seriously and again offering themselves up as targets for his "take a shot at the rich people" class envy shooting gallery. They should take whatever it is the current occupant offers in the course of these "negotiations" and not give up one damned thing in return. Time is now on THEIR side. Let them savor the moment as the current occupant is allowed to twist slowly, slowly in the wind that he created. Indeed this moment of long delayed justice for the current occupant brings to mind an adage his doting grandmother evidently failed to teach him: "Sow the wind; reap the whirlwind". // some portions of article redacted for brevity // > Nation Obama says businesses must hire, invest to grow economy By Brady Dennis Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, February 7, 2011; 3:30 PM In his most overt effort yet to mend ties with the nation's business community, President Obama on Monday pledged to make government an ally to companies as they emerge from the worst economic downturn in generations. "As a government, we will help lay the foundation for you to grow and innovate," Obama told a crowd packed with business executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "We will upgrade our transportation and communications networks so you can move goods and information more quickly and cheaply. We will invest in education so that you can hire the most skilled, talented workers in the world. And we'll knock down barriers that make it harder for you to compete - from the tax code to the regulatory system." But even as he vowed to push hard on initiatives from trade deals to corporate tax reform, Obama challenged the business leaders to ramp up their hiring, to bring jobs back from overseas and to quit sitting on such large stockpiles of cash. "Many of your own economists and salespeople are now forecasting a healthy increase in demand. So I want to encourage you to get in the game," Obama said, noting the tax credits the administration recently negotiated to spur new investments. "As you all know, it is investments made now that will pay off as the economy rebounds. And as you hire, you know that more Americans working means more sales, greater demand and higher profits for your companies. We can create a virtuous cycle." The president also defended his health-care law and urged the business community to refrain from challenging regulations. The relationship between the Chamber and the current White House has been a turbulent one over the past two years.&&&1

This has been a difficult decision to reach, and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications," Vinson wrote. Next stop...the CONSERVATIVE leaning SCOTUS (who he stupidly insulted during his SOTU address last year, and they are still pissed about that) It looks as though Obama's Hellcare, a multi trillion dollar hostile government takeover of our healthcare that no one wanted, will soon become NULL & VOID!!!!!

Lingle never hid anything from the public Gov. Neil Abercrombie must release the names of the other candidates for a position on the Hawaii Supreme Court once his nomination of Sabrina McKenna as associate justice is confirmed by the state Senate, according to the state lawyers who administer the open-records law. Abercrombie has refused to disclose the names of the other candidates to the high court sent to him by the Judicial Selection Commission. But the Office of Information Practices responded yesterday by letter to a query by the Star-Advertiser and said the reasons for confidentiality would end once his nominee is confirmed. Cathy Takase, OIP's acting director, later said once McKenna is confirmed, the governor "must release the names under the law." Donalyn Dela Cruz, Abercrombie's spokeswoman, said he received a copy of the letter, and "we will review the letter and determine our next course of action."&&&2

Sarah Palin for President&&&I saw a thread on here awhile back asking about this but couldn't find it. After the events of the last few days and the disgusting behavior from democrats and their minions I have decided that I WILL vote for Sarah Palin if she runs. The crazies came out of the word work from the democrat side and quickly took a horrific event and MANUFACTURED it into an anti-palin event. Those who used the lone gunman's attack as an "opportunity" to FALSELY attack Sarah Palin and somehow try to blame her are just sick sick people. If this is what the democrats have to offer then even if she doesn't run for president one thing is for certain I will never ever vote for a democrat again!! Their behavior has just been disgusting. To "try" and use the shooting deaths of people including that of a little girl for their agenda is disturbing to say the least. Actually I would call it downright evil. The only people who fell for it are the weak minded. Sane Calm intelligent rational people will prevail in this and they will remember the people who used this horrific event as an attack on a Sarah Palin. Even the weak minded will in the days and weeks to come realize that those sounding off at the beginning of this with their attacks are scary people and spoke to quickly and falsely. Mark my words on that. It was one of the most disgusting things I have seen and the sane calm intelligent rational people of America will remember this but not in the way those disgusting people want.&&&130

"I'm not saying the public shouldn't know ... but public employees should not be subject to exposure any more than the private sector," said Sen. Pohai Ryan, Senate Bill 624's primary introducer. She cited potential identity theft and the right to privacy as her rationale for the proposal. "They should not be second-class citizens." But University of Hawaii media law professor Gerald Kato said there are sometimes good reasons for open records that trump workers' right to privacy. Nepotism and corruption are harder to spot when names are private. More secrets..........&&&15

Should You Enter Into a Joint Venture Agreement?&&&A JV (or JVA) is a Joint Venture Agreement; basically, its a partnership. Some people recently have been asking me my opinions about whether they should get involved in these types of operation agreements. The story is generally the same: one investor knows of a distressed and motivated seller and approaches another investor to partner on a Honolulu flip deal. Why would the first investor approach another instead of doing the whole thing himself? It could be a mix of multiple reasons: 1. Doesnt have enough funding to acquire and/or rehab the property on his (or her) own 2. Doesnt have the rehab knowledge or an available rehab team ready to go 3. May not like the neighborhood of the property but still wants to capture some profit 4. May be willing to sacrifice some profit in exchange for the time it will free up to work on other deals simultaneously. The last one is interesting because it represents not a limitation (as in the first two) but a..... Full post:&&&4

Asian-American lawmakers demand Limbaugh apology&&&"SACRAMENTO, Calif. Rush Limbaugh's mock imitation of the Chinese language has stirred a backlash among Asian-American lawmakers at the state and federal level. California state Sen. Leland Yee, a Democrat from San Francisco, is leading a fight in demanding an apology from Limbaugh. In recent days, the state lawmaker has rallied civil rights groups in a boycott of companies like Pro Flowers, Sleep Train and Domino's Pizza that advertise on Limbaugh's talk show. During a Jan. 19 program, Limbaugh said there was no translation of President Hu Jintao's speech during a visit to the White House. He launched into a 20-second-long imitation of the Chinese leader's dialect. Shortly after condemning Limbaugh's remarks, Yee says he received racist death threats to his San Francisco and Sacramento offices." Sounds like censorship to me. This is how this democrat uses his power? To go after a talk radio show that just happens to be against idiot democrats. What about rappers, comedians, authors, bloggers, etc etc etc. Who say anything that is politically incorrect? With fools like Yee no wonder California is gone. ching chau mam pam see woo&&&16

Federal agents and the maker of the device told the court they are used in high-profile drug and terror cases, and material pertaining to the devices cannot be disclosed in court." "This is a petty misdemeanor, the lowest form of criminal conduct that can be alleged. Think of the amount of money the state, federal government and defense is spending on what is a petty misdemeanor, said defense attorney Tom Bush."&&&5

The bird is a non native invasive species and has a well deserved reputation as a horrible noise maker, not unlike the fighting chickens that destroy peoples' sleep all over the islands. Too bad for the peacock; at the same time it is amazing that they are not wiped out for all the noise they cause as well as damage to roofs, autos, and other property. The charges are ridiculous; the woman should be offered some help to deal with her damaged nerves and these birds should be removed from Hawaii.&&&277

Costly drugs raise spending for diabetes - News&&&Health officials in British Columbia, Canada have studied and had some success in controlling diabetes, particularly in what Canadians refer as First Nation populations. Changing dietary habits from what could be described as the current North American model or intake and replacing it with traditional foods and consumption quantities appears to have decreased the instance of diabetes in these populations. It would be worthwhile investigating these Canadian studies and seeing if there is the potential for application to the varied population groups residing in Hawai'i who are experiencing high levels of diabetes.&&&4
Is Obama a Manchurin Candidate?&&&I saw this on another thread here on Topix and wanted to see what you all can dig up to refute this or prove it...the following are not my words... The great mystery.......... Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from President Obama's past saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc.?? Not one person has ever come forward from his past. VERY, VERY STRANGE.. This should really be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man. Reminds me of The Manchurian Candidate.... Let's face it. As insignificant as we all are .. someone whom we went to school with remembers our name or face ... someone remembers we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully or something about us. George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. He questiones why no one has acknowledged the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia -- the class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him. While he is such a great orator, why doesn't anyone in Obama's college class remember him? And, why won't he allow Columbia to release his records? NOBODY REMEMBERS OBAMA AT COLUMBIA ! Looking for evidence of Obama's past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there, but none remembered him. Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983 In 2008, Root says of Obama, "I don't know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia. EVER! Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, "Class of '83 political science, pre-law" and says, "You don't get more exact or closer than that." Never met him in my life, don't know anyone who ever met him. At the class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, who's kind of the, as we say in New York, the macha who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him." Obama's photograph does not appear in the school's yearbook and Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia. NOTE: Root graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a Political Science major in the same class that Barack Hussein Obama was supposed to have been in. Some other interesting questions.. Why was Obama's law license inactivated in 2002? Why was Michelle's law license inactivated by Court Order? It is circulating that according to the U.S. Census, there is only one Barack Obama but 27 Social Security numbers and over 80 aliases. WHAT!!??? The Social Security number he uses now originated in Connecticut where he is never reported to have lived. No wonder all his records are sealed!&&&1

Obama scolds his kook base today&&&Here are his exact words: "But what we cant do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on one another. As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility. Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy, and remind ourselves of all the ways our hopes and dreams are bound together." "But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized  at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do  its important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds." "For the truth is that none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack. None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped those shots from being fired, or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent mans mind."&&&31

"The browning of America is a reality that an aging white population needs to come to terms with. As the largest racial minority group in the country with a higher birth rate than the national average, Latinos will inevitably represent a majority in many key states." The article holds up Illegal immigrants as some sort of people that have the rights that "real" citizens enjoy and pay for. The blatant racism in the above quote is disturbing to say the least. I can't believe the Star Advertiser would run this crap as well. It's words like this that only hurt Latinos that aren't racist and good people. They need to step up against people like alvaro and so does the rest of the country. What a racist fool!!&&&207
Deficit-saddled states try to rein in unions&&&"We can no longer live in a society where the public employees are the haves and taxpayers who foot the bills are the have-nots," Mr. Walker, a Republican, said in a speech.

I couldn't find this article on the Star Advertiser site after reading it Sunday so here is a link I found after trying to find it for a long time. Strange it has disappeared from the New York Times site as well. Anyway...http://www.greenchang e.org/article.php?id=6424 Hawaii is so "saddled" well...more acurately sucked dry by unions and their democrat bought seats...the unions own most of politicians so they are basically nothing more then paid employees for the unions..

Hanabusa said ....legislators work very hard and deserve the raise. As of December 2009 Hawaii pays the highest salary for part-time legislators. Great more of the same.

"PALIN: I'm proud of Jan Brewer for standing up for the constituents in her state, sending a message to Washington, sending a message to President Obama saying, Hey, you need to do your job, sir. And if you're not going to do it, OK, then we are compelled to do the job for you until you get it right." Like I said I was dead set against it before but I am warming up to the idea.

Quoting the governor, from the article: "I have been open and consistent in my opposition to same-gender marriage, and find that House Bill 444 is essentially marriage by another name." Then why did she make us all wait? Because she was engaged in deep contemplation of the issues? I'd sooner think it was deep contemplation of her own political career. What she has essentially told gay Hawaiians is that in her judgment, they don't deserve equality. She has told them they don't deserve the experience of being married. She has told them they don't deserve any status for their relationships. And she has told them that they don't deserve to be considered a family. Quoting the governor again: "The subject of this legislation has touched the hearts and minds of our citizens as no other social issue of our day" Well, clearly it hasn't touched hers. Oh, I guess that would require her to actually use her heart to feel something, and her mind to reason with compassion. Further quoting the governor: "It would be a mistake to allow a decision of this magnitude to be made by one individual or a small group of elected officials." Such hypocrisy. The decision was made by one individual - Governor Lingle - overriding the people's elected representatives - people whose job it is to make decisions of great magnitude on behalf of those they represent. Shame on you, Governor Lingle. Shame and Ignominy.&&&561
Fireworks ban long overdue - Hawaii Editorials&&&I used to play fireworks when I was a child. I got asthma as an adult but I still enjoyed fireworks on New Year's Eve. But this last New Year's Eve's fireworks were terrible! Those loud illegal fireworks were frightening. It sounded like a war zone and when it exploded near you, you could feel the vibrations and see the falling ash. And we weren't playing with those bombs. It appeared the neighbors up the street were playing those "bombs". Too close for comfort. I am now on the side that seeks to ban fireworks totally. People abuse the privilege of playing fireworks.&&&56

Jobs and employment in Honolulu&&&Hello everyone, I would like to know what the current employment situation is like in Honolulu right now. Me and my wife lived there in 2002 to 2003 and are currently overseas as of this time. She wants to return to Honolulu right now but I feel that because of the recession, that it is a bad idea. I do not feel that me with a liberal arts degree and her with an AA degree will be able to be hired anywhere that pays enough money to survive and live there. If anyone can give me information as to the how the economy is doing and the job scene both good and bad, I would be most appreciative. Thanks to all in advance for your help, Steve B.&&&2
Man charged with shooting at Waipahu apartment - Hawaii News&&&I'm glad you "cleaned up" this article. Whoever wrote the Breaking News version needs to be let go. OMG -- very poor writing skills.

Hawaii hotels offer perks, bizarre deals&&&Everyone I know said they would never return to Hawaii ever again. After Hawaii adopted EVIL ISLAM DAY, many people no longer want to visit Hawaii. There are many other places to visit that don't cost so much. Many people cannot even say Merry Christmas at Christmas time or they will get fired. All the stores took down all the nativity scenes, and now they all say Happy Hollidays. Merry Christmas is now a four letter word. On top of this insult to over 60% of the country, Hawaii creates Islam day , which is a total violation of separation of Church and state. Hawaii does not seem to get it. Hawaii is on the NO GO list. Go ahead and keep your Islam day. My family will never returrn to Hawaii ever again. Everyone I know is deeply ashamed of Hawaii's outrageous new EVIL ISLAM DAY.&&&23

Sahme on you Samoans!!!&&&Just today I sat in a local MacDonald's while a group of teenaged Saomans came in and alarmed everyone present by being loud and abusive by peppering their language with descriptions of defecation and vulgar and gross descriptions of bathroom functions of some person they were acquainted with. I finally turned to them and told them that other people were around and eating and they did not want to hear about anything related to the bathroom. They became offended at the attempt to correct them. The manager was called for and the manager kicked them out of the restaurant. Is this the normal behavior for teenaged Samoans? Do they need to behave like animals and then be insulted when others tell them to behave....it is all too much to put up with...Samoan parents if you don't want your children to come home hurt or dead then teach them the way to behave in public...this is a public safety issue...&&&1

Environmental group finds high level of toxic chemical in Honolulu drinking water&&&The occurrence of data exceeding regulatory thresholds is addressed in a quality assurance project plan. I suspect that the environmental group has no knowledge of quality control in data analysis; there is a method to the "madness" involved in the reporting of analytical results - these involve the use of control samples to assess matrix effects (spiked samples) and random error (trip blanks). Also, there are protocols set up way in advance of the analysis to determine whether or not to reject data.&&&4

My story may be of help to you...&&&My name is Deborah Walter from Houston ,Texas. I never believed in love spells or magic until i met this spell caster once when i went to Africa in January this year on a business summit. He is really powerful and could help cast spells to bring back one's gone, lost, misbehaving lover and magic money spell or spell for a good job or luck spell .Im now happy & a living testimony cos the man i had wanted to marry left me 2 weeks before our wedding and my life was upside down cos our relationship has been on for 3years... I really loved him, but his mother was against us and he had no good paying job. So when i met this spell caster, i told him what happened and explained the situation of things to him.. At first i was undecided, skeptical and doubtful, but i just gave it a try. And after 21 days when i returned to Texas, my boyfriend(now husband) called me by himself and came to me apologizing that everything had been settled with his mom and family and he got a new job interview so we should get married. I didn't believe it cos the spell caster only asked for my name and my boyfriends name and all i wanted him to do... Well we are happily married now and we are expecting our little kid, and my husband also got the new job and our lives became much better. In case anyone needs the spell caster for some help at no cost service his email address is merujhaspell@aol.com&&&1

Residents confront shark tour operator - News&&&While I agree with not letting this guy run this type of tour, I want to pay closer attention to the last paragraph of this story. The state is proposing legislation to regulate commercial activity in state waters requiring a commercial permit. Okay, but just another nail in the coffin for small business trying to flourish in this anti-business backwards thinking state. "you can't do this", "you can't go there", "you have to have a permit", "no commercial activity allowed". This state is so bent on closing every damn thing down to access that no business stands a chance. Then you have a state that lets the Super Ferry go because of a bunch of nut environmentalists. You have DLNR regulating everything they can with fees and closures. And you have a Democratic legislature that says we have to tax our citizens to make up the loss due to the economy. Hello. Has anyone ever told the legislatures that business pays into the tax coffers? When you make it so hard for them to survive it will come back to haunt you. Backwards state, with backwards thinking anti-business thinkers.&&&1041

Kahana Valley evictions delayed - Hawaii News&&&Granted the state passed a bill to protect Kahana valley from being commercially developed, there should have been stipulations to protect the rights of the families who lived there. The state needs to amend this bill where leases of these families could be "grandfathered" into the bill which would allow them to continue living in the valley but at the same time prevent future leasing. I have seen other state leasing plans for families on welfare where they leased the house to a family for as long as they occupy the house. If the following family generation meets the criteria to occupy the house, the next generation would continue leasing the house. An amendment patterned after the welfare leasing program would surely work in this situation. The state would protect Kahana at the same time keeping these families from becoming homeless.&&&16

Amway Settles Lawsuit&&&ADA TOWNSHIP, Mich.Amway Corp saysit's paying $34 million in cash and $22 million in products to settle a class-action lawsuit by ex-distributors. The independent distributors say Amway misled them and engaged in unfair practices hurting their earnings. They sued in 2007 in federal court inSan Francisco. Amway said Wednesday it's not admitting liability. It says it made changes after the suit was filed. The company is based near Grand Rapids in Kent County's Ada Township. Chairman Steve Van Andel and President Doug DeVos say they regret some distributors' experiences "fell short" of Amway's standards. Amway says it's expanding a money-back guarantee for products and training materials distributors bought. "Fart on Amway" says one disgruntled associate. Amway is a "Want Only Product" "We can get similar products at Walmart for a fraction of the cost"&&&6

KGMB Breaking News Not Breaking at All!!&&&What is wrong with KGMB? Thursday at around 7 pm they interrupted regular TV programming for what they called breaking news. That news ended up being the possible upcoming change that is possible for UH football. Are they crazy? This is not urgent and not worthy of breaking into programming. That and it was poorly done anyway. It could have easily waited for the 10 o'clock news. This seriously makes them and this State look like a bumpkin backward place where this is considered urgent and breaking. This really made me think of the lacking that our local and national news has as a whole. It is a sad state that for my world news I have to watch or listen to a foreign station to get it. The news is no longer the news it is entertainment and opinion talk shows. There is much going on and all we here is about celebrities and or some bloated personalities that like to hear themselves talk about nothing. I digress KGMB you have really became horrible and this cements I am done with you. Oh yes what is up with all the local news stations now doing the weather at the beginning and then usually 2 or more times during a broadcast? The weather in Hawaii is not that exciting that is why people flock here. HELLO?? It can be covered in less the five minutes and near the end of the program.

fur 17&&&With Coach Arnold at the helm ,the Rainbow Warrior Basketball Team has a good future. First of the bench was a freshman and he continued to sizzle through out the game.

Also, adjustments were made in the second half and they played better as a result. This team will not end up in the cellar of the WAC confrence, but might be challenging for the first spot.

So WHY don't they do that? Because they know that they'll probably LOSE. And by blocking the road, they're trying to garner as much sympathy and support as they can. They're trying to turn this "legal" battle into a "polital" one. So it's a good thing that they were arrested. Because now, they'll have to PROVE that the land is theirs when they're defending themselves in criminal court.&&&330

What followed this rapid warming, cooling, warming, cooling, warming... All without mass human involvement. The Earth is reportedly less volcanically active today.

ASUH Senate involvement&&&Mike G. H. Chun Email: chunmike@hotmail.com October 17, 2010 Professor Calvin Pang William S. Richardson School of Law University of Hawaii at Manoa Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 USA Cal, Citation:Fees burden UH Manoa [University of Hawaii at Manoa] students: A proposed $8.30 increase to fund activities has students questioning the timing, by: Dan Nakaso, Honolulu Star Advertiser newspaper (Honolulu, Hawaii), Online, Local News, 10/16/2010, 1:30 am HST URL: Hey, old buddy! I see where the undergraduate students at UH Manoa are complaining about the burden of student activities fees. Things havent changed much since I was a UH Manoa undergraduate ASUH Senate member. Back then, I was busy mastering the dynamics of American state & local government at the UH Manoa Political Science Department. My interest in Hawaii politics led me to participate in the legislative process of the ASUH Senate. Of course, my interest in the Hawaii State Legislature led me to study the American polity. I was fascinated with the formative issues of Hawaiian Archipelago governance. It was that initial exposure at the Hawaii State Capitol as a legislative intern, the special Sim Con Con (Simulated Constitutional Convention) course, and ASUH Senate funding of forum/symposia during the Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978 public education which hooked me on local politics. When you are young, the memories seem so vivid. The emotions are so pure. Our political idealism seems to justify the righteousness of our motives. Cal, we are now old men. Were both 56 years old. Weve just passed the Zenith of our careers. With each passing year, we are less than the year before ... until the final leaf has fallen. For many years during that initial involvement, it was like groping around in the dark. I was surveying the terrain, seeking to identify the major features. Each nascent discovery led to exciting interpretations of American federalist representative democracy. The aggregate level social sciences provided penetrating analyses of the human behavioral environment all around me. Of course, there were setbacks. I often experienced failure, misgivings, and regrets. But that was a component part of demystifying our polity. Human nature was often a challenge. Translating thought, deeds, & motives of others was a fascinating social laboratory. It was like dissecting an animal & examining its organs under a microscope. It seems like Yesterday. In fact, it was nearly 33 years ago, when I first began my Journey. Aloha. Mike Chun, CCFC c: Rep. Corinne W. L. Ching, Liliha Congressman Charles Djou, CD-1/Hawaii&&&1

Read it and weep, Stoners.&&&Associated Press SAN FRANCISCOAttorney General Eric Holder says the federal government will enforce its marijuana laws in California even if voters next month make the state the first in the nation to legalize the drug. The Justice Department strongly opposes California's Proposition 19 and remains firmly committed to enforcing the federal Controlled Substances Act in all states, Mr. Holder wrote in a letter to former chiefs of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The AP obtained a copy of the letter, dated Wednesday. "We will vigorously enforce the CSA against those individuals and organizations that possess, manufacture or distribute marijuana for recreational use, even if such activities are permitted under state law," Mr. Holder wrote. The attorney general also said that legalizing recreational marijuana in California would be a "significant impediment" to the government's joint efforts with state and local law enforcement to target drug traffickers, who often distribute marijuana alongside cocaine and other drugs. He said the ballot measure's passage would "significantly undermine" efforts to keep California communities safe. If Proposition 19 passes in November, California would become the first state to legalize and regulate recreational-pot use. Adults could possess as much as one ounce of the drug and grow small gardens on private property. Local governments would decide whether to allow and tax sales of the drug. The state has clashed with federal authorities over marijuana since 1996, when voters approved a first-of-its-kind ballot measure that allowed people to grow and use pot for medical purposes. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. Under federal law, marijuana is still strictly illegal. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government has the right to enforce its ban regardless of state law. During the Bush administration, retail pot dispensaries across the state faced regular raids from federal agents. Their owners were sometimes sentenced to decades in prison for drug trafficking. Yet the medical-marijuana industry still grew and has expanded even more since Mr. Holder said last year that federal law enforcement would defer to state laws on using it for medicinal purposes. Some legal scholars and policy analysts have questioned how much the Justice Department could really do on the ground to halt a state-sanctioned recreational-pot trade. Nearly all arrests for marijuana crimes are made at the state level. Of more than 847,000 marijuana-related arrests in 2008, slightly more than 6,300 suspects were booked by federal law enforcement, or fewer than 1%.&&&1

Hawaiian flight grounded by bird strike, arrived 14 hours late&&&The story seems to be a little different since I was one of the stranded flyers. The actual truth to the story is the the original flight HA 25 was canceled and the flight that was suppose to depart for Maui was the flight that got cancelled due to damages caused by the bird strike. Our flight HA25 was on schedule so they cancelled our flight hoping that the mechanics would have enough time to fix the original Maui flight and give to the Honolulu flight but the mechanics who were fixing the plane could not fix it as planned. It took over 8 hours before they told us that the flight was rescheduled for 3:25 AM departure. Apparently the Honolulu Corparate decided to push those who were on HA25 to the left to accomadte the Maui passengers. So those who were on HA25 got the wrong end of the deal. That is the correct story and if you think I made it up ask Kirk Mathews or Linda Colbert who were on the same flight.&&&1

Read This Now&&&Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it? That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home etc. When did this happen? It's in the healthcare bill. SALES TAX TO GO INTO EFFECT 2013 (Part of HC Bill) REAL ESTATE SALES TAX So, this is "change you can believe in"? Under the new health care bill - did you know that all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax? The bulk of these new taxes don't kick in until 2013 (presumably after Obama's re-election). You can thank Nancy, Harry and Barack and your local Democratic Congressman for this one. If you sell your $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Is this Hope & Change great or what? Does this stuff make your November and 2012 votes more important? Oh, you weren't aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren't alone. There are more than a few members of Congress that aren't aware of it either (result of clandestine midnight voting for huge bills they've never read). AND, there are a few other surprises lurking.&&&1

Punahou Baseball (Discipline Tactics)&&&Last week Friday the Punahou Baseball team lost to Iolani at Ala Wai Field. Regardless of the reason, the team was not allowed to ride the bus back to Punahou. So the team had to walk back to school. I wonder what would have happened if they played in Waipahu again? Would they have to walk from there? Who really cares if the coaches walked to. This is slave mentality. The owner speak, or orders, and the slaves listen or hell will be payed. I find this completely outrageous! This is so dangerous! You have a team of boys walking on the street late on a Friday night. It's dark and who knows who's out there driving. Plus McCully is one of the main streets into Waikiki, so there is a lot of traffic and there is a high possibility that intoxicated drivers could be going to the clubs in Waikiki. Are the coaches adults or what? Isn't the primary responsibility of the coaches the safety and well-being of the kids? This lewd and ridiculous act alone show that winning and their egos are more important than building self-esteem and safety. I can't understand what kind of adults would put kids into a situation where they would be humiliated. Also, how does that make the school look? The baseball team is walking back after a game because they lost. That is absurd! Hopefully the correct actions are taken. Personally I think these coaches owe the school, the parents, and most importantly the boys a huge apology. These kinds of actions make the school look terrible. Is winning really that important where you could severely damage a kid's psyche? Auwe! What do the rest of you think? I can't see how the school can support this type of discipline and I think immediate action should be taken.&&&151

Eternal Life&&&Today, and for the past 2,000 years, those of us who have been saved by faith in Jesus, have been saved by faith in the King of all kings, the Prince of Life, the Prince of Peace, who is a priest after the order of Melchizedek, not the Levitical priesthood (Gen. 14:18-20, Psa. 110:4, Heb. Ch. 7). The Levitical priests were not eternal, because all of them died. All of those priests were sinners and had to offer up offerings, kosher animals, for the forgiveness of their sins as they did for the people of Israel.1 This was a thing, a ritual, that had to continuously be done because the Law of Moses made nothing perfect.

I am so happy for Mr. Pang that he is stepping up to the plate and fighting back it's just so sad that it has to result to this, especially after his wife passing...Shame on the Humane Society for not being more understanding and resolving this issue...Mr. Norman Pang is a nice man only trying to do a good deed....&&&70

Triumphant Ground Zero Victory Mosque to be sited in Lower Manhattan&&&The very same subhuman Islamo Facist evil doers who flew fully fueled jetliners into densely packed skyscrapers are now planning to mark the tenth year of their glorious triumph over Uncle Sam with a Victory Lap ... in the form of an in your face mosque right near where they murdered three thousand of our fellow citizens. And THE VERY SAME people who are whining about the "free exercise" clause of the First Amendment in an attempt to justify this monumentally brazen act of Islam Fascist jeering of America have never -- BUT NEVER -- mentioned that provision when it comes to the Christians they hate who seek to worship when and as THEY please.

Review: Hanoa Trucking Inc&&&I just got yelled at by a driver driving a tandom truck with the name, 'Hanoa trucking, inc.' on the side. He was speeding in front of waianae highschool, talking on the phone, and swerving. He swerved enough into the emergency turn lane that he nearly hit me and so he felt it necessary to yell at me. I was totally offended and resented being yelled at by some punk kid simply because I made a left hand turn out of whs into the emergency turn lane to wait for traffic to clear enough that I can merge. I've been making that turn now for over ten years. This young boy is a delusional danger if he thinks he was right to yell at me, when all things are considered. Finally, I went online to find a number where I may reach his boss and make a complaint, but the one number I did find, was disconnected. So, if you're looking for hauling services, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. This business is shady like their drivers. 8/13/2010.&&&4

Our needlessly politicized federal court system&&&Tired of some federal judge overturning the will of the people? Want to do something about it? Start a grass roots movement leading to a Constitutional Amendment that will overturn the 1803 Marbury vs Madison decision. The Founders made officials accountable according to the power loaned to them. Members of the all powerful House of Representatives (Article I) therefore must face voters every TWO years. The very powerful officer presiding over the Executive Branch (aka President) must face voters every FOUR years (Article II). The branch intended to be the LEAST powerful, the Judicial Branch's Supreme Court (Article III) was to be populated by those who would NEVER face the voters, but be appointed for life. Then Chief Justice Marshall in the Marbury decision claimed for the Court a power that was NEVER envisioned by the Founders, the power to invalidate (declare "unconstitutional") the work product of the other two co-equal branches. Ever since CJSCOTUS Marshall so egregiously usurped the power of the court, the concept of "Enumerated Powers", "States Rights", and especially the Tenth Amendment have all been holed at the waterline. We have now reached a point where an unelected federal judge can act like a pure tyrant, accountable to NO ONE, and overturn the will of the people of an entire state. A simply worded amendment could castrate the court and put it back into the box envisoned for it by the founders: "The Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch -- and ONLY those two branches and ONLY when those two branchs are in accord -- shall have the power to declare any federal or state law unconstitutional. At this point the Judicial Branch could go about the business originally intended for it: trying cases according to the Law of the Land as determined by the other two branches of government. At that point, no one would care WHO the President nominated for the high court or WHETHER the Senate confirmed or denied that nomination. Thus would end the charade that has resulted in an ever increasing number of miscarriages of Justice.&&&1

Let this be a lession to everyone out there. If dog comes after you turn yourselfs in before he can get you. The only reason I say this is because he only goes after stupid people that can't or don't know how to hide.&&&3

Honolulu keep your garbage we don't want it!&&&First let me say, I was stationed at Barbers in the early nineties. I live off base in Eva, and up in Royal Kunia while I was there. Living in Hawaii, I really felt what Aloha is. My wife's family is from Hilo, HI, and someday god willing we'll move back. Was listening to public radio here this morning, here is link to the story and audio online; The show talked about effort to stop the shipment of rubbish from the islands to the Columbia gore. I thought, wait this can't be? I've always looked at Hawaii as being champion, and leader in environmental conservation efforts, and really the first to establish save guards against invasive species. Then to find out, no real recycling program set up in Honolulu was kind of shocking. I've worked as a garbage man, and recycling truck driver. I understand recycling programs. I've lived where you live, and I still feel like an ambassador of Aloha. If we are to protect the land, protecting what comes in is number one. Second should be to make the most of what is there. It might be hard to see at first glance, but the rubbish from the city is a byproduct resource of everything allowed into and from Hawaii. Out near Campbell industrial park west side of Barbers Point in the old ammo dump area would be a prefect area to build a rubbish to resource facility. Where the cities rubbish can be sorted and the waste stream not just stopped but turned around and could also create good paying honest jobs for the Waianae side. Some people will say, "oh to expensive that kind program,yea" and give you a list of reasons why to keep doing things the same old way, ok. But all the costs they speak of do not account for what are called "Environmental externalities" Simply put and environmental externalities is what Hawaiians know as "The Garbage Patch". Energy form the waste and the waste itself could be used to rebuild Oahu's failed transportation system, or create useful products that normally have to be shipped into the islands. Long term establishing stricter "Green" manufacturing requirements should be the goal, a popular term now is "Cradle to Cradle design" That means whatever the product is, its parts can be reused or go into the ground eventually become dirt again. It is my sincere hope that Honolulu and the state of Hawaii will once again assume a leadership role in showing American and the world the true meaning of land stewardship and spread Aloha and not rubbish. My name is James Yarger, I'm a student of industrial design in Portland and my minor is in sustainability. I would love to help be a part of the solution, to help show the potential of waste as economic resource. Warmest Aloha from Oregon.&&&5

Hawaii FACTS&&&Everyone wants to come to Hawaii.2nd Hawaii is expensive ,and so much goverment money to aide people , that pretend to be mental when not , Maicronisions get the blame , Very important Thanks to Good old America what was done to them and their country. Hawaii politicians are crooked , But thats every where , donot b ..ch or complain get out and vote or donot belly ache about it . Standards of living in Hawaii are lower then Califorina, Rochester , ETC . Enforcing laws like walk at cross walk or fine right , However not all areas where need to cross street has cross walk example malakahana park so crossing is that jay walking? Hawaii mix crowd , natives , other countries and main lander people , Hawaii is a place do your own thing. Hawaii beaches etc very old bathrooms very dirty , Hawaii either one likes it or not . 1st my view grocery stores are not expensive , diner food cheap until traveled out of ones circle 1 thinks their area expensive , grocery stores here nothing of Stop and Shop chains or Wegmans if people are fuzzy Hawaii is not the place for them , Hawaii an island that doesnot want any part of the main land or etc . Hawaii is destroying its self .Why is lower standards excepted here ?Such a back log in welfare and etc ... Places like Malakaha cabins thats allowed , things acceptable here isnot in other areas . Hawaii weather nice , but quality of things lower wjy is that?Good luck to all that come to Hawaii Aloha .&&&5

Sound Familar?&&&Violent and abusive behavior is the abusers choice Despite what many people believe, domestic violence and abuse is not due to the abusers loss of control over his or her behavior. In fact, abusive behavior and violence is a deliberate choice made by the abuser in order to control you. Abusers use a variety of tactics to manipulate you and exert their power: Dominance  Abusive individuals need to feel in charge of the relationship. They will make decisions for you and the family, tell you what to do, and expect you to obey without question. Your abuser may treat you like a servant, child, or even as his or her possession. Humiliation  An abuser will do everything he or she can to make you feel bad about yourself or defective in some way. After all, if you believe you're worthless and that no one else will want you, you're less likely to leave. Insults, name-calling, shaming, and public put-downs are all weapons of abuse designed to erode your self-esteem and make you feel powerless. ISOLATION  In order to increase your dependence on him or her, an abusive partner will cut you off from the outside world. He or she may keep you from seeing family or friends, or even prevent you from going to work or school. You may have to ask permission to do anything, go anywhere, or see anyone. Threats  Abusers commonly use threats to keep their partners from leaving or to scare them into dropping charges. Your abuser may threaten to hurt or kill you, your children, other family members, or even pets. He or she may also threaten to commit suicide, file false charges against you, or report you to child services. Intimidation  Your abuser may use a variety of intimidation tactics designed to scare you into submission. Such tactics include making threatening looks or gestures, smashing things in front of you, destroying property, hurting your pets, or putting weapons on display. The clear message is that if you don't obey, there will be violent consequences. Denial and blame  Abusers are very good at making excuses for the inexcusable. They will blame their abusive and violent behavior on a bad childhood, a bad day, and even on the victims of their abuse. Your abusive partner may minimize the abuse or deny that it occurred. He or she will commonly shift the responsibility on to you: Somehow, his or her violent and abusive behavior is your fault. Abusers are able to control their behaviorthey do it all the time. Abusers pick and choose whom to abuse. They dont insult, threaten, or assault everyone in their life who gives them grief. Usually, they save their abuse for the people closest to them, the ones they claim to love. Abusers carefully choose when and where to abuse. They control themselves until no one else is around to see their abusive behavior. They may act like everything is fine in public, but lash out instantly as soon as youre alone. Abusers are able to stop their abusive behavior when it benefits them. Most abusers are not out of control. In fact, theyre able to immediately stop their abusive behavior when its to their advantage to do so (for example, when the police show up or their boss calls). Violent abusers usually direct their blows where they wont show. Rather than acting out in a mindless rage, many physically violent abusers carefully aim their kicks and punches where the bruises and marks wont show.&&&2

Hawaii homeless programs receive grants&&&They need to use that money to shape legislation that would do away with the current climate that encourages security guards and the police department to physically assault and threaten and intimidate the homeless and engage in activity that has been banned internationally as a component of torture and that is sleep deprivation...It seems to be in vogue for the security guards and others to take it upon themselves to engage in activity that is directly in violation of Hawaii laws and the police and the public backs this up...a country used to do this to its citizens and that was Geremany in the 20's and 30's and look what happened to them...so if it is o.k. for this to go on what is the next step...Open season on the homeless??? Does this mean that they have to consider arming themselves to secure to themselves the rights that the rest of us take for granted???&&&1

Immigration - Honolulu, HI&&&Typical ramblings of the fringe right wing who helped put our country in this position in the first place. Pre-emptive war? How'd that work out? Unfunded bribe (Medicare Part D legislation) to seniors to gain Bush's re-election? How much is that adding to our debt each year? Let's not even mention the Republican tax cuts of 2001/2003 and the debt they've put our country in. 2 Wars - still not mission accomplished! Osama still not captured, either Dead or Alive! Mine and oil disasters killing our environment, but thanks to Republican deregulation and cap on liability, taxpayers get to foot the bill! All this while the Republicans cozy up to Wall Street to prevent any controls on Wall Street in order to avoid future economic disaster. After 2 financial disasters, torture which failed to produce any actionable intelligence, tax cuts that redistributed the wealth in this country to the top 1%, a pre-emptive war based upon a lie that has yet to be "Mission Accomplished", well over 4000 dead American soldiers from 2 unfunded wars, Iran Contra - guns for IRAN - our enemy, Watergate, soaring debt, and lies so blatant, that it doesn't take much effort to prove them false - WHY, WHY would we want to trust REPUBLICANS ever again with the governance of this country. One only has to look to Arizona Republicans to understand their true fascination with Hitler and Nazi fascism: "Show me your papers, please!"&&&7

Recommended area to buy home&&&HI all! I am moving to Hawaii from Califonria for my husband's job. Where would any of you guys suggest looking for a home? I see Ewa Beach is more affordable, but there must be a reason for that. Is it an OK place to raise a family? I am also looking at the Mililani area. I would like to look at the Windward side, but it appears more expensive. Any thoughts on Ewa Beach or Mililani would be appreciated. I have not been to the areas to know. I only know what I see on the internet. Thanks!&&&10

FBI eyes 80 in isles for mortgage fraud&&&If your loan officer told you to lie about your income or assets on your loan application, contact your local FBI office and give them this info. Otherwise, you may lose your home and go to prison or have a felony conviction on your record and receive probation. It is happening. No joke. Many loan officers had their borrowers lie to qualify for a loan. They have committed fraud and you are a part of it unless you come forward with the facts now as an unknowing participant. The L.O. probably told you that it was OK and thats what the loan was for....wrong. Read the statement you signed on page 4 of the loan app. and decide if an idiot loan officers word is going to supersede your sworn statement of truth on the application. On top of all that, the L.O. probably ripped you off and you don't even realize it yet.&&&103

Clintons Smell Obama Blood&&&Following Hillary's domestic policy comments in Ecuador and Bill's "bomb the hole in the Gulf" comment, the Clintons pulled a master stroke. While Bill was sitting with Putin in Russia, the FEDS announce 11 Russian spies were arrested. Obama, who just days before had negotiated away our missile defense to Russia calling it a "RESET" was caught flat-footed and had to lie and claim he knew about the spies. Amazing what we accomplish when Obama is completely out of the loop.&&&10

Obama Pushes Discrimination Against Latinos&&&Obama has instructed the Attorney General to sue Arizona saying its new immigration law "potentially encourages racial profiling." But today, Obama effectively encouraged discrimination against all Latinos. In his speech, Obama said he has instructed ICE to go after American businesses who hire or "prey upon undocumented workers" as he put it. He also specifically rejected E-VERIFY which checks the immigration status of prospective employees. The net result is that ANY BUSINESS THAT HIRES A LATINO UNDER THIS PRESIDENT WILL NOT KNOW WHETHER THAT WORKER IS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL UNTIL IT IS RAIDED BY ICE AND SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. This means that many employers will not hire ANY Latinos since they don't want to lose their business and end up in prison should one be illegal. Si se puede, Mr President!&&&9
Death, detention and dollars: Part II&&&I was sent a letter from my brother who is currently serving a 10 year sentence for felony fire arms(3 shot gun shells) and recieving stolen goods(he signed for his friends package). He is alone and sends letters that tell me that Saguaro is a very corrupt place. He said that he fears he will never see us again. He has served two years of his sentence. He wrote in a recent letter"Good behavior goes un-noticed.The amount of bull politics in this facility make me wanna puke." He also said the gurads try to provoke bad behavior by talking smack to the inmates, just to get a reaction from them. He said "This facility and this company is corrupt so are some of the administrators from Hawaii." He is taking law and keeps busy with whatever he can do. However, I would like to note that he has no prior record but traffic tickets. I want him home alive, I do not want my brother free due to death. When he gets out I want to celebrate not mourn.&&&1

Unfair and Disparate Treatment of GLBT citizens by Hawaii Business Roundtable&&&The Executive Committee of the Hawaii Business Roundtable has sent a letter to Governor Lingle recommending that she veto HB 444. Does the Executive Committee realize that the businesses they represent employ GLBT employees too? Write to these businesses and inform them that you will boycott their services since they choose to discriminate against GLBT employees. Hit them where it hurts - in the pocketbook! The Executive Committee of the Hawaii Business Roundtable and the Businesses they represent are: HBR Chairman: Harry Saunders, President, Castle and Cook Donald Horner, President & CEO, First Hawaiian Bank Alan Uyeda, President & CEO, First Insurance Company of Hawaii Dee Jay Mailer, CEO, Kamehameha Schools Arthur Ushijima, President & CEO, Queens Health Systems H.

Correct...you can't... With housing prices around $600,000 plus where can you find affordable housing??? Correct...you can't.

Rail Job&&&"Chronology of Mufi's Rail 2004: Rail will cost $2.7 Billion and 1% GET charge is needed. 2005: OK fine, 0.5% tax will do it  well get $450 Million from the FTA. 2006: Rats! The Alternatives Analysis had to spoil it. Rail will cost $4.6 Billion. 2006: Rats! Cliff Slater noticed that the 2000 Bus Rapid Transit also planned by Parsons Brinkerhoff for the Harris administration had higher projected ridership than rail. So... with rail we pay 3 times more to get less. 2006: City will have Feds give it as much as Los Angeles and New York City:$750 Million. 2007: This state is run as a banana republic. As such, it starts collecting people's taxes to build a system that has no environmental approvals. 2007: Smoke and mirror events begin in earnest paid by taxpayers. Neither Leeward Community College nor UH-Manoa get any stations. 2008: Hannemann gives a helicopter ride to Oberstar who then says that Feds will give $900 Million. Hannemann declares that the train has left the station. 2008: Senator Inouye says that if we lose the EPA lawsuit for sewage treatment the $1.2 Billion bill will break the back of the city. 2008: Council support is shaky. Back room deal-making results in a route via Salt Lake. 2008: DEIS comes just two (2) days before the General Election and referendum or rail promising a ridership of 97,000 in the opening year!(No modern light rail in the US, even in cities 5 times bigger than Honolulu, carries more than 38,000.) There is no time to review the DEIS but Inouye advises that people only need to read the summary. Fed share is now claimed to be $1.2 Billion. 2008: Public is deluged with city, union and Hannemann campaign Light Rail commercials, emails and letters, and a 50.6%victory is obtained. 2008: More political maneuvering and the route goes back via the airport. Warnings that it violates Federal Aviation Administration rules are ignored. 2009: Construction will start at the end of the year.(Isnt it still 2009?) 2009: Rail is insolvent  Inouye joins the rail party. Feds are now claimed to pay $1.55 Billion. 2009: We lost the EPA lawsuit and appeal. We are now $1.2 Billion in the hole. But ignorance is bliss. 2009: Desperate for good news. Hannemann:Rail creates 10,000 jobs! 2009: UH Economic Research Unit: Rail might create up to 2,000 jobs in its peak year.(Given that all rail technology and materials need to be imported, I estimate that Local Jobs will be no more than 1,000 per year.) 2009: In November Hannemann declares that he is willing to wait a month or two to iron out some details; 6 months later his iron is not working. 2010: City steals $300 Million from future TheBus capital investment to balance TheRail budget. 2010: Four years after the Alternatives Analysis and three years after the start of tax collection this proposal has no environmental clearance, no cultural resources clearance and no robust budget. 2010: The cost is up to $5.4 Billion not counting the expensive Airport Runway avoidance. Hannemann really needs to get off this train. Posted by Panos Prevedouros at 1:33 PM "&&&1

Jesus Saves Sinners&&&ALOHA AND WELCOME TO A FORUM SITE THAT DESIRES TO BE A HUMBLE TESTIMONY FOR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I am a saved, born again Christian. I love the Lord Jesus Christ. I love my Heavenly Father. I love my Heavenly Comforter, Holy Ghost. John 3:16 is both simple and yet profound. In order to have the gift of ETERNAL LIFE you must realize that you are a lost sinner on your way to an eternal hell - lake of fire - place of eternal torment. You must cry out to God the Father, Lord be merciful to me a sinner and believe that the blood that Jesus the Son of God shed on Mt. Calvary was shed for the cleansing of all your sins. Friend, will you right this moment welcome the Lord Jesus Christ to be your Lord and Saviour of your life and soul??? The greatest "ALOHA" "LOVE" YOU WILL EVER ENJOY IS TO BE FOUND IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BY FAITH. This has been Preacher Jim.

Security Guards in Hawaii&&&Security guards in Hawaii are constantly being caught saying and doing things they are not supposed to be doing...when a complaint is lodged then the DCCA and the various security companies spend their time, energy and effort in investigating the one who brings the complaint...all in an effort silence them... It is also interesting to watch the various places that security guards work at and doing things that are not related to their secuity jobs...gathering carts from the parking lots...sweeping and etc. this does nothing to help unemployment because various places could potentially hire security guards and have them do things for free that they would otherwise be forced to hire someone else for...&&&1

It's the essence of the social rhythm we call "news." Each day is different than the next, and in the long run, relationships bond and break, the world spins a little farther, each generation creates new generations, and each adapts to what's thrown at them. The only thing that never changes is the essence of change itself. The Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin have a long and tangled history together, but in the end, each paper was better for having the other as a sparring partner. The bell has rung. It's time for yet another change. Tomorrow will bring even more adventures, and we'll be here to report and interpret them for you. The ride isn't over. Every day, it's just begun."&&&25

Obama Is Chinese&&&The Chinese used to predict the future by collecting the Emperor's morning turds and placing them in a bowl. After a thorough examination of the Emperor's turds, they would arrive at consensus and advise the Emperor of the proper course of action. I was reminded of this while watching the photo-op of the President squatting down and examining the tiny oil turds on the beach with his counselors. The very next photo-op showed Obama back at the White House sitting at a table with Axelrod, Emmanuel, Napalitano, Cisneros and global-warmer Carol Browner. On the table was a lone bowl. On the bottom of the bowl were the words "Made in China." Coincidence?&&&1

The Stupid Stupid Stupid Waikiki Cops&&&I've traveled to Waikiki/Honolulu for the past 17 years and it's never been this bad with the hotels in Waikiki. Imagine this for a moment: You have prostitutes everywhere at night, LOUD motorcycles (Harley's everywhere), fights breaking out in the streets, and the Honolulu police turn their heads and grin. You would think I'm joking, but I'm not. I asked one police officer why they won't do anything and he said,'Hey this is Waikiki, no?' and he laughed. In the meantime, I parked near the Sheraton (because who wants to pay $25 a day in parking?) and I received 2 parking tickets - both unjustified and both cost $70. If you park 1 inch to the red zone, you will get a ticket. Then, I get pulled over and I get a $100 ticket for using my speaker cell phone near the Sheraton. In the meantime, the hookers, the motorcyclists, and all the gangster teens continue to harass all the tourists with impunity and the Honolulu police shrug their shoulders while giggling over my tickets. I ended up screaming at my precious wife over these morons. I would consider leaving Honolulu at all costs. Boycott this island and vote for another mayor and vote in new reps.&&&7

Or in which VA Hospital in which rehab room is the guy who took his place trying to learn to walk again. Watada, watch the Indy 500 on Memorial Day, go to the beach on Veterans Day, just don't think about the guys who served and sacrificed.

Obama and Bush on Taxes&&&So waaaas up with dis you conservanuts? If all the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of 2010, a single parent who earns $25,000 a year with one child would receive $928 from the federal government in 2011 in refundable tax credits. If all the Bush tax cuts are extended, the parent would receive $1,881 in refundable credits. Finally, under Obamas policies, the parent would receive $2,281 in refundable credits. A married couple (two earners) making $85,000 a year with two children would have a tax liability of $7,235 in 2011 if all the Bush tax cuts expire,$5,383 if all the cuts are extended and $4,583 if Obamas policies are adopted. A single taxpayer earning $60,000 with no children would see a tax bill of $8,236 in 2011 without any of the Bush tax cuts,$7,484 with all of the Bush tax cuts and $7,084 with the combination of expirations and extensions proposed by President Obama. A double-earner married couple making $150,000 with two children would have a tax liability of $22,776 in 2011 if all the Bush tax cuts expire,$19,268 if all the cuts are extended and $18,468 under Obamas proposed combination.&&&2
Police ramp up security in Chinatown - Hawaii News&&&Tonight HPD really beefed up patrols near the corner of River/Pauahi streets. There were about a dozen uniformed officers standing guard. They stayed there until 1:15 a.m.(Sunday). I did not notice any drug activity taking place during these hours. While this move appeared to have worked temporarily, the only problem is can HPD afford to put a dozen officers on this corner every single night? I doubt this would be cost efficient. Anyway it was nice to have some relief from all the drug trafficking that goes on in this area.&&&104

New clamor on old Obama doubt - Hawaii News&&&Just a few thoughts on this. First your newspaper run bith announcements...if I called one in back in 1961 exactly WHO on your staff would check to see it was legit? I am guessing NO ONE. You can stop using that as legal proof he is a natural born citizen. Second, exactly WHO in the US government is tasked with checking or making sure somone is actually a natural born citizen? If such an entity actually exists then there has to be some sort of public record report saying they checked and report who checked along with what they checked. If such a report exists post a GOVERNMENT link to it please. Last it was my understanding that Hawaii has both a "certificate of birth" (which basically says, you were born) and a "birth certificate" which lists the specifics of that birth. The widely published document is that "certificate of birth" which in NO WAY proves he was born in Hawaii....I won't even go INTO the glowing errors in it like "father's race - African"....oh really?(Gary Player is an African too...but is white as snow. President Obama can authorize the release of his Birth Certificate if it exisits, why hasn't he and put this to bed for good? OK flame away. Sorry if this offends anyone, but frankly I like seeing the law followed..to the LETTER and not just poo poo'ed as some sort of conspiricy.&&&427

One good shake leads to another - Hawaii News&&&All tsunamis that have hit Hawaii in the past 100 years have come from earthquakes triggered in Alaska. I grew up in Kailua on the windward side. When we heard that warning siren my Father would pack up the Family and head for higher ground. This happened more during the 50"s and 60's and you could say we have dodged the bullet so far. When ever I hear a earthquake has happened I immediately contact all family members putting them on alert. I sorry to say its just a matter of time before it happens here. This article makes me nervous with highlights on chain reaction type earthquakes, and the sizes(9.0 to 9.7) which is huge. Alaska and California seems to worry me the most with those Pacific plates beginning to slip and slide. With the state cutting back services I hope we keep Civil Defense operational and ready for action.&&&22

Why is the Bamster so desperately trying to hide his records?&&&Inquiring minds wanna know: Why is the Bamster so desperately trying to hide his records? What is it he needs to keep hidden? LAW: Nine Indicted on Charges of Accessing Obama Records MAY 12, 2010, 10:22 P.M. ET By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DES MOINES, Iowa  Nine people were indicted Wednesday on federal charges of accessing President Barack Obama's student loan records while they were employed for a Department of Education contractor in Iowa. The U.S. attorney's office said a grand jury returned the indictments in U.S. District Court in Davenport. All nine are charged with exceeding authorized computer access. They are accused of gaining access to a computer at a Coralville office where they worked between July 2007 and March 2009, and accessing Mr. Obama's student loan records while he was either a candidate for president, president-elect or president. U.S. attorney spokesman Mike Bladel referred questions to online copies of the indictments. Each of eight indictments posted by Wednesday night were brief, saying the charged individual "intentionally exceeded authorized access to a computer and thereby obtained information from a department and agency of the United States" and "intentionally accessed student loan records" of Mr. Obama without authorization. Those charged are Andrew J. Lage, 54, Patrick E. Roan, 51, Sandra Teague, 54 and Mercedes Costoyas, 53, all of Iowa City; Gary N. Grenell, 58, and Lisa Torney, 49, of Coralville; Anna C. Rhodes, 32, of Ainsworth; Julie L. Kline, 38, of West Branch; and John P. Phommivong, 29, for whom no hometown was listed. Lage told The Associated Press on Wednesday evening he did not know about the indictment and declined comment. Messages were left for Teague, Torney and Costoyas. A telephone listing for Kline rang unanswered and a listing for Rhodes was disconnected. No telephone numbers were immediately found for Phommivong, Roan or Grenell. Six of them are accused of accessing Mr. Obama's records when he was a candidate, according to the indictments online. One is accused of accessing the records when he was president-elect. An indictment for the ninth defendant was not immediately available online. Court records did not name the contractor that employed the defendants. Arraignments are scheduled for May 24. The charge is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.&&&1

Perreira calls it like it is&&&"Ms. Lillian Koller's May 5 press conference is merely an example of the Lingle-Aiona administration trying to 'save face.' Instead of simply accepting the sound decision by the legislators to stop the DHS reorganization plan, the administration chose to use this as an opportunity to get back at their employees, lawmakers and anyone who didn't go along with their plan. "Not only was Koller's May 5 press release filled with inaccurate information, but some of her public comments made at her press conference were absolutely shameful and disrespectful to her dedicated employees. "Legislators, led by Rep. John Mizuno, did right in requiring DHS to implement a pilot project for such a large reorganization that would impact the lives of thousands in our community. The Health and Human Services Committees heard hours of testimony from both sides, including DHS employees, clients, social service nonprofit agencies and citizens, who came forward to voice their concerns about how this plan would hurt the most vulnerable in our community. "HGEA strongly supports enhancing and improving government services, and public employees would be the first to tell you that there are ways to create better service and greater efficiencies for taxpayers. In this situation, however, Ms. Koller wanted the reorganization to be completed in an unrealistic amount of time, and employees who should have been involved in the planning process were totally left out and ignored. "The bottom line is that this idea was doomed to fail from the start. To suggest an electronic system for clients, without a plan to digitize the paper records that now exist, is totally irresponsible. Koller's claim that this system would be better for clients is shibai. Truth is, by the time the public would figure out that the system had become more inefficient, Koller would be long gone from office and not accountable for her decision. "What is more disappointing is Ms. Koller's lack of support and respect for her own employees. She publicly accuses her employees of conducting a 'sick out,' which is an absurd and irresponsible accusation. Ms. Koller also blames her staff for not keeping up with the workload, saying that the 'backlog has grown worse.' She's being completely disingenuous by not acknowledging that staff furloughs are the significant reason for the backlog in processing. "Shameful comments like hers make it easy to understand why morale is so low in her department, and why employees have no confidence in her ability to lead the Department of Human Services."&&&1

She was there for an education and not a surf tour. The last e-mail I received from the museum curator last year indicated that Ka'iulani was happy when 'on the water.' The comment would have mentioned surf-riding or a similar term if she was not on a boat or walking on the pier. Ka'iulani, contrary to common belief, was a very active and athletic woman. Although I would like to believe that she introduced surfing to Europe, as a resarcher, I would like to see more evidence. Moreover, Ka'iulani should be remembered for her intelligence, her talents as a pianist, seamstress, and artist, and her love for her land and people. Not merely as a surfer girl.&&&4

VICTORY for the Free Exercise Clause, HUZZAH!&&&HIP HIP HOO RAY! TODAY'S NEWSPAPER Supreme Court overturns objection to cross on public land By Robert Barnes Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, April 29, 2010 A splintered Supreme Court displayed its deep divisions over the separation of church and state Wednesday, with the court's prevailing conservatives signaling a broader openness to the idea that ... ********** the Constitution does not require the removal of religious symbols from public land.********* A 5 to 4 decision by the court overturns a federal judge's objection to a white cross erected more than 75 years ago on a stretch of the Mojave Desert to honor the dead of World War I. Six justices explained their reasoning in writing, often using stirring rhetoric or emotional images of sacrifice and faith to describe how religion can both honor the nation's dead and divide a pluralistic nation. The bottom line, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote, is that "the Constitution does not oblige government to avoid any public acknowledgment of religion's role in society." Although joined in full only by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Kennedy's opinion will be closely parsed as courts across the country consider challenges to religious displays in public settings. But it is a narrow ruling, offering less guidance for the future than a stark acknowledgment of the fundamental differences between the court's most consistent conservatives and its liberals in drawing the line between government accommodation of religion versus an endorsement of religion. To Kennedy, the cross "is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs" but a symbol "often used to honor and respect" heroism. He added: "Here, one Latin cross in the desert evokes far more than religion. It evokes thousands of small crosses in foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell in battles, battles whose tragedies are compounded if the fallen are forgotten." Dissenting Justice John Paul Stevens said: "The cross is not a universal symbol of sacrifice. It is the symbol of one particular sacrifice, and that sacrifice carries deeply significant meaning for those who adhere to the Christian faith." Still, despite stirring rhetoric in Kennedy's opinion, the decision did little to clarify the court's murky jurisprudence about how government can accommodate religious symbols without violating the Constitution's prohibition on the endorsement of religion. It seems likely that once the legal battles are over, the 6 1/2 -foot cross standing atop an outcropping called Sunrise Rock will remain, although that was not settled by the decision. The five most consistently conservative justices seem tolerant, based on Wednesday's decision and past rulings, of religious symbols on public land, but the court's four liberals seem deeply skeptical. The lineup does not bode well for other challenges to religious symbols, such as San Diego's 29-foot cross and war memorial on Mount Soledad. But even the five who agreed Wednesday to return the case to lower courts split three ways in their reasoning. "To date, the court's jurisprudence in this area has refrained from making sweeping pronouncements, and this case is ill suited for announcing categorical rules," Kennedy wrote.&&&4

HIM Yao Sui: What do Hawaii's people think about me? (Comparative politics)&&&I really have no idea of how Americans view their own nation. Is America a good nation or bad nation? Do Americans have compassion for other people and for other nations? Are Americans truly good people, just, upright, and compassionate? Would an American help a poor foreigner in need and would they help any man who is down and out on his luck? What percentage of this nation's population are Christian? If a man came to this nation for the very first time and the police beat this man four to six times without provocation, would you support the local police if they were guilty? If I, China's Emperor-in-Exile, were a truly good man a Christian and a member of China's last dynasty, The Manchurian Ch'ing Dynasty, wanted to kill me, so that they could sit on China's throne, would you have any sympathy for me or would you tend to support and accept their leadership of China? If the warrior priest of the Dalai Lama's family killed my family members in Pakistan, though we did not offend him or do him any harm. Would Americans still lend their support to the Dalai Lama and say that he is truly a good and non-violent man? If my mother gave her all to the poor and elderly, in spite of our poverty, would Americans, posting here, in this forum, still continue to spit on me? Do you know what it feels like to be punched out by a police officer 10 times bigger than yourself? Or to be beaten and abused by homeless people and left for dead? I am not really interested in anonymous answers. If real people from Hawaii could post their answers, I would really like to hear from them. What do Hawaii's people think of a truly good family coming from China and later hoping to return to do a lot of good China's millions?&&&5

Honolulu's Rail Transit Plan&&&Powering our rail system Is Mufi's proposed rail system the train to nowhere like Sarah Palin's bridge to nowhere?

Has the cart been put before the horse again? It is my understanding that the HECO grid is about 80% of its capacity now, but someone can correct me if I'm wrong. Is HECO going to build a new $500,000,000 oil fueled and air polluting power plant dedicated to supply the system with the megawatts of electricity that will be required for its operation? Aren't we supposed to be moving away from our dependence on oil and moving toward self-sustainability using renewable energy resources? Is an environmental impact review being conducted to address the added pollution to our island from another power plant? Is HECO going to keep raising electric rates across the board to maintain its profit margins as more residents go green by cutting power consumption? What's the point in going green? We may go green, but our costs will remain the same to maintain HECO's profits so why bother? We will remain with the old status quo instead of moving forward to a better future. Are we going to build a small nuclear power plant on Oahu to supply the system with a more reliable source of electricity than the HECO grid which is bound to fail over and over again with the added load? Are we going to have a dedicated source of electricity for the system so if it fails, it doesn't bring down the entire island like we had in December, 2008 when then President-elect Obama was vacationing here? Will the new high tech Honeywell wind turbines be used at strategic places along the route to provide auxiliary power for lighting and more? . What happens if the system is expanded to Nanakuki and Waianae or Hawaii Kai or the Windward side? Where will the extra power capacity be generated? Will HECO be able to keep up with ever expanding infrastructure for business, residential and more rail? Is the electricity going to be pulled out of thin air or from a limitless power source like the Zero Point Modules ( ZPMs ) on the TV series Stargate Atlantis? Is this system going to be another bottomless pit for federal and Hawaii taxpayer money to support the choo choo to nowhere? Is the cart before the horse again? Is there even a horse or is it just a stubborn donkey or mule? Their policy from the very beginning was to ignore everybody and all questions. Their latest spin is that "people voted for it" so they are doing everything, including ignoring everything, to lay the rail.&&&2
The big switcheroo to keep you from catching on&&&APRIL 22, 2010 MONEY Money Makeover:$100 Bill Gets Facelift to Fight Fakes By ALEJANDRO J. MARTINEZ -- Write to Alejandro J. Martinez at alejandro.martinez@wsj.com The U.S. government wants you to accept its new Benjamins: its new $100 notes. It hopes that counterfeiters are less pleased. The Treasury Department unveiled what it calls "the next generation one hundred," a redesigned $100 bank note to stay ahead of counterfeiters. The new $100 notes will be available on Feb.10, 2011. The old bills will continue to be accepted until they wear out. The familiar portrait of Benjamin Franklin remains in the usual spot. But a historical reference to the quill used by the Founding Fathers appears superimposed over phrases of the Declaration of Independence and a 3-D security ribbon crossing the center capture attention. The images on the ribbon move as the bill is tilted.It's all designed to thwart attempted fakes. By now, the government has become intimately familiar with the process of rolling out new money. Over the past decade, the $20,$50,$10 and $5 have all received makeovers. The new look puts the finishing touches on what the government calls its second major redesign. The $100 bill last got a makeover in March 1996. As a rule of thumb, the Treasury redesigns currency every seven to 10 years because advancements in technology have made counterfeiting outside the norm of professional criminals possible. The name of the game is to make notes that are hard to counterfeit but easy for the public to authenticate. Now it's the $100's turn. It's a hefty matter when one considers there are 6.5 billion $100 notes in circulation and as much as two-thirds of it circulates beyond the country's borders, according to the Federal Reserve. In 1996, when the $100 currency was last redesigned, it got a portrait watermark, an embedded security thread and color-shifting numeral 100. This time around two of the most prominent features the public will notice right away are a 3-D security ribbon woven into the paper and a bell in an inkwell. The 3-D security ribbon contains images of bells that transform to numeral 100s that turn into images of bells, and back again, as the note is moved. When the note is tilted back and fourth, some images on the ribbon appear to move side to side. If the note is shifted side to side, these images slide up or down. What's at work is a new security technology called Motion that was developed by Visual Physics, a subsidiary of Nanoventions, based in Atlanta and acquired by Crane & Co., the manufacturer of U.S. currency paper based in Dalton, Mass. Sweden's 1,000-kroner banknote was first to use this technology. Crane & Co. wouldn't comment for this article. As for the bell-in-an-inkwell feature, when the note is laid flat on a table, only a solid copper inkwell is visible. When the note is moved, the inkwell changes color from copper to green. The movement will also make a Liberty Bell appear. In addition, the reverse of the $100 note will now show the back instead of the front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The portrait watermark, security thread that can only be seen when a bill is held up to light, and the color shifting $100 have all been retained with a twist. The color shifting $100 feature now changes from copper to green instead of black to green. "We retained security features that are effective and made them more discrete," said Michael Lambert, assistant director for cash at the Federal Reserve. (( to be continued ))&&&3

Is their even a horse or is it just a stubborn donkey or mule? Their policy from the very beginning was to ignore everybody and all questions. Their latest spin is that "people voted for it" so they are doing everything, including ignoring everything, to lay the rail.&&&1
Soldier charged in attack on wife&&&He should have dumped his old lady than try to knock her on the head. It would have been cheaper and wiser. Now he has to face the consequences. So sad. I guess a lot of (50%)married couples would like to slam their other half, but realize in order to minimize the losses they just divorce and replace them. As the saying goes " buyer beware". Don't get into the trap.&&&122
Dr. Richard Knabb Joins The Weather Channel As Tropical Weather...&&&I am sorry to see Lyons go. I thought he did a credible job, but he was up against the salary cap and NBC is tightening the belt at TWC. But it is just an awful decision to hire Knabb who lacks credibility. He was one of the instigators of the revolt at NHC in 2007, which gave NHC and NOAA a black eye. He lied about Bill Proenza and hurt his reputation then betrayed the rest of the NHC employees by leaking that petition.&&&1

E coli outbreaks at Honolulu restaurants&&&Just read that DOH closed a restaurant after four persons who ate there were hospitalized for coliform poisoning. That is incredible. As a student working as a waiter many years ago, I became violently ill after eating my in-house meal. Turns out that sixteen other customers went to the hospital. An older waitress implicated the cook, who had a nasty habit of sticking his hand in his pants to scratch his posterior. The cook was fired, but the restaurant never recovered as closed in a year.&&&26

Hawaii's ethnic diversity still tops&&&Hawaii should not come under the U.S.Census. Hawaii can never be lumped under the national U.S. Census.

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Aloha: It is evident that letter writer Paul Smith has never had the job of selecting appropriate photographs to accompany news stories. It would have looked worse if the editor had selected a picture of the Governor smiling and looking happy at facing such tough decisions that affect so many lives. For the record, it is not up to the state worker that Mr. Smith would have pictured. Showing the Governor is less than the GOP-preferred portrait was very appropriate -- a good choice. It's sort of a "no-win" situation for Governor Lingle and the photo used by the Star-Bulletin helped convey that thought. Good choice. Me ka pono, Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&6

Theatres also existed at Fort Kamehameha, Fort Armstrong (which had beautiful architectural detailing), Tripler Medical Center and Lualualei Naval Ammunition Depot. The military housing areas also had theatres, including CHA (Civilian Housing Area) 2 & 3, NHA (Naval Housing Area), adjacent to Hickam and Pearl Harbor, and at Red Hill.&&&26

Putin is STILL calling the shots&&&The so called "accident" Saturday April 10 that just happened to kill key government leaders of Poland transiting Russian air space near Smolensk raises a disturbing question: was this a deliberate shootdown (i.e., decapitating strike) by Russia intended to intimidate and then subjugate Poland, aimed at returning Poland to the status of a Cold War era buffer state? Conveniently, all those who might offer an account of the crash other than that so quickly put out by Russian authorities are dead. One may recall the reason for the journey was to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Soviet massacre of Polish army officers in the Katyn Forest, hardly something the Russian calling the shots (Vladimir Putin) wants to be reminded of. Even more important,-- given our 44th Presidents abrupt cancellation of a long planned U.S. missile defense site in Poland -- Putin may sense in this craven U.S. attempt at appeasement a long awaited opportunity to expand Russian influence in the former Warsaw Bloc buffer state whose liberation -- by Reagan, Iron Lady Thatcher, Pope John Paul II and a low level ship yard worker named Lech Walesa -- must still sting like hell. In events leading to the collapse of the USSR, Poland was the first domino to fall. Whatever the truth, there IS one thing we CAN be ABSOLUETLY sure of: the current occupant of the White House will AGAIN be exquisitely dainty refusing to "meddle" in the affairs of a hostile government he wants to cozy up to. His base attempt to appease Iranian tyrants -- when they were rounding up and killing their own citizens who were marching for exactly the kind of Freedom our own civil rights activists fought for nearly half a century ago -- made that abundantly clear.&&&1

Racism and prejudice linger in Hawaii, says chief justice - Haw...&&&Hawaii is known as the aloha state - the open, loving, caring, accepting, etc. place. That attribute has always made me happy I live in Hawaii. Born and raised in Nanakuli. We've seen our share of negative publicity due to racism and prejudice. Compared to other places in the mainland our bigotry is mild. However, it does exist. We live in an imperfect world with imperfect people...that's no excuse. How does one become a bigot, prejudiced and racist? Is it learned behavior? Is it a pre-determined choice at birth by your parents or care givers? Is it a choice made by ones experiences? I guess in the legal world lawyers and judges are suppose to be neutral... Depending on what side of the street you live on...lucky you live Hawaii or lucky you don't live Hawaii. I believe it's like that no matter where you live. My answer: It's a personal choice.&&&881

Go! Mokulele to launch Honolulu-to-Lanai service May 20&&&They cancelled my flight from Kauai to Honolulu in December 2009. I have still not received my refund. Furthermore, their customer service department has put it on me to call them back every time I want to know the status. Their account department claims that a refund was issued in March, but I have checked my statement, along with calling my credit card company...but no refund was given. Just to be clear, Mokulele Airlines cancelled my flight a few hours before boarding, forcing me to purchase a second flight home from another airlines, but will not give me my money back. I consider that stealing. I will never fly them again!&&&1

HGEA Responds to 4/01 Advertiser Editorial&&&Dear Editor:The Advertiser editorial staff has set a new low in suggesting in its April 1 editorial that, despite its obvious flaws, Lillian Koller's proposed reorganization of the Department of Human Services should be given a try. Frankly, given the concerns raised by both social services organizations and benefit recipients, the editorial opinion expressed is disappointing, irresponsible and downright frightening.Ms. Koller's plan to shutter welfare offices and limit access to two physical locations is ill-planned at best, mean-spirited at worst. The individuals who rely on these services are among the most vulnerable and underprivileged in our community. Limiting their physical access while expanding access via the Internet and telephone is a travesty  the reality is that many of these individuals, as the editorial acknowledges, lack the ability to use these means of communication. Implementing such a technological change for business registration or obtaining permits is one thing, as most individuals who seek such services likely have telephone and computer access.I, for one, however, don't see the likelihood of elderly clients or homeless families using laptops and cell phones to obtain support services. Given that the services and support provided are life-sustaining and not a luxury for the recipients, it is irresponsible for the editors to suggest that the State should proceed. As a result, these at-risk individuals will likely go without assistance, creating greater social calamity in our community.While there is always merit to seek efficiency and improved workflow, toying with the lives of vulnerable citizens is not an area for idle experimentation. The change proposed by Ms. Koller would be best viewed as a long-term and phased-in effort. Successful outcomes occur when line staff and management are involved and allowed to provide input during the redesign process, and staff and clients have ample time to adjust to a new method of offering support. Unfortunately, Ms. Koller is seeking to blast this change through in her last days on the job. Her motives are unclear, but the legacy she leaves behind is easy to see  a reduction in the benefit rolls, as individuals who lack access drop out of the system, likely resulting in increased human suffering out of the public's eye. A sad legacy indeed.It is our hope that sanity will prevail and that our Legislature will take steps to protect our vulnerable citizens by requiring a more deliberate pace of change at DHS. Those of us who are fortunate enough to have the means to provide for ourselves and our families, have an obligation to help those who are less fortunate.We will fail as a community if we boldly ignore the negative impact on people's lives and rush this change without proper consideration. Sadly, the Lingle Administration seems more smitten with studying the impact of a rail system on our community, rather that determining the impact of the proposed DHS changes on our needy. Hawaii has a long history of providing support for our most disadvantaged  let's not abandon that history for the sake of experimenting with efficiency and modernization.Sincerely,Ran dy PerreiraExecutive Director&&&1

TALK ABOUT FAT... Now we just need to do this with EVERY department in the WHOLE state. Isn't that sweet?&&&3

Another Sunday that will live in infamy&&&MARCH 22, 2010, 5:22 P.M. ET Landmark Health Bill Goes to Obama's Desk Deal on Abortion Puts Biggest Change in Decades Over Top; Democrats Rejoice, but Republicans Predict Electoral Gains By GREG HITT And JANET ADAMY -- Write to Greg Hitt at greg.hitt@wsj.com and Janet Adamy at janet.adamy@wsj.com Louise Radnofsky and Amy Dockser Marcus contributed to this article. WASHINGTONThe transformative health-care bill is slated for President Barack Obama's signature this week in the culmination of efforts by generations of Democrats to achieve near-universal health coverage. The focus now shifts to the Senate, which will take up a companion bill as early as Tuesday. The House gave final passage Sunday to the Senate's health legislation in a 219-to-212 vote, as Democrats muscled the measure through on the strength of the party's big majority. In the final roll call, no House Republican voted for the bill, and 34 Democrats voted no, many of them representing Republican-leaning districts. A short while later, the House, voting 220 to 211, approved a companion bill making changes to the Senate bill, a measure necessary to attract support in the House. All Republicans voted against the companion bill, as did 33 Democrats. Mr. Obama, who staked his presidency on the health-care overhaul, helped push it toward passage with a last-minute promise to issue an executive order making clear that no money dispensed under the $940 billion bill would pay for abortions. That persuaded Rep. Bart Stupak, a holdout Michigan Democrat, to vote yes and bring at least seven colleagues with him. The president spoke late Sunday night at the White House. "At a time when the pundits said it was no longer possible, we rose above the weight of our politics," he said in hailing the vote. "We proved that this governmentstill works for the people." It was a tumultuous sprint to the finish for legislation that has brought Washington many dramas in the past year, ranging from a Christmas Eve Senate vote to the surprise January election of Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown that upended Democrats' plans. "You will be joining those who established Medicare and Social Security and now, tonight, health care for all Americans," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), urging Democrats to pull together. "This is an American proposal that honors the tradition of our country." Minority Leader John Boehner (R., Ohio) condemned the legislation and said Democrats were moving against the will of the public. "Shame on this body. Shame on each and every one of you who substitutes your will and your desire above your fellow countrymen," he said. "By our actions today we disgrace their value." -- more to follow --&&&14

Curtain closes on $1 movies - Hawaii Business&&&I stopped going to theaters years ago. Too much pilikia getting dressed, find parking, standing in line to buy a ticket, waiting and waiting for the start, forced to watch the dumb commercials, interruptions by noisy yakkers, chair kickers, and coughings, then exiting through slow foot then parking lot traffic. So easy now to just rent Netflix, make a computer backup without the commercials, and watch it whenever you want in the comfort of your home and kitchen. Why go through so much trouble, waste time and money when you can invest in a wonderful Blu-ray stereo system like Sony's Bluray home theater system and have theater-like surround sound. With you get free shipping and save over $80 on sales tax. Go get one.&&&31

The last straw will be the passage of the Akaka Bill and then to have him as governor.

Than speaking 10 minutes later, spoke of keeping elderly healthy, and that her and Barack were lucky they have no bills?? A few ago you tried to make us believe you were like us with bills?.

Let's HELP JIM and BOYCOTT NOW< there are other Title companies who actually do not lie or deceive. Please I did everything a person, hard working, honest person is suppose to do and now live in my car because of a corrupt town and neighbors. Please I need everyone's help.

Public Housing&&&Again many of our civic leaders prove that they are not stupid, so that just leaves lazy or physically, emotionally and intellectually exhausted when it comes to the myriad of issues surrounding homelessness and public housing...at one point the state had ignored maintenance since 1995 and at another the fire marshall ignored inspections and recommendations for repairs and updates for fire safety...at one point the state conceded that they could not afford the upkeep of the public housing and one reason was because many of the tenants were behind on the rent...so a proposal was made to speed up the eviction process and maybe get some current tenents to purchase the untis in which they live...to do so they said they would have to check credit ratings...well it seems to me that those who occupy public housing in the first place have poor or non-existent credit ratings and they could in no way afford to purchase the units in which they live, which is the very reason they needed public housing in the first place....if they speed up the evictions then does that not contribute to the already Kafka-esque homeless problem?...Let me know what you think...&&&2

Hon Advertiser: Obama seeks to reassure seniors on health care&&&Honolulu Advertiser article 3/15/10 ========== Associated Press STRONGSVILLE, Ohio  With a fresh sense of urgency, President Barack Obama sought to reassure seniors today about health care legislation approaching a final vote in Congress, pledging it would make preventive care cost-free and close a gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage. "This proposal adds almost a decade of solvency to Medicare," Obama said in a visit to a senior center. Obama's trip to Ohio marked his third out-of-town foray as he tries to build support for long-stalled legislation to remake the health care system. Administration officials have predicted the legislation will clear the House by the end of the week, but Democratic leaders had not yet released the measure as the president's helicopter lifted off from the White House grounds..... ========== I don't which is worse, Obama and his lying to the public regarding his health care initiatives or Mufi and lying regarding his proposed Aloha train to nowhere. Hawaii residents don't want either but both will be railroaded into existence. Obama care will NOT benefit the majority of seniors and Mufi's train will NOT benefit the majority of Hawaii residents and commuters. Both will do much harm but by then they will be doing other things and blaming everyone else for their failure. Yes, health reform is needed in the US, but Obama's reform will not help, especially when you add all the "deals" that are included in the bill to get, union & lawyer support, & Democratic representatives to 'vote' yes on the measure. It is clear with this Obamacare, good or bad, the House/Senate will shift from Democrat to Republican and if that happens, Congress will NOT fund Mufi's train. Add the fact it looking more like Obama will NOT get a second term. However it is clear if Mufi becomes Governor and Caldwell or Apo become mayor, they will rush to begin construction , regardless of federal funding. Now I understand how some have mentioned that is why Mufi has not announced his candidacy for Governor and is pushing so hard to begin construction of the rail prior to resigning as Mayor. That also includes pressuring Lingle, with the help of his State Democratic accomplices, to get Lingle to sign off of the yet to be completed EIS without any independent review. However, with all of this local political shenanigans going on, including all of the State Democrats in cahoots with Mufi, if Hawaii residents boot out all of the current State legislatures, and City reps (including Tam) out of office. Wonder if rank and file for HSTA, HGEA, AUW, city bus driver's union, etc would actually support Mufi, Caldwell, etc as they could not be that gullible to believe if the rail is railroaded through in Hawaii, regardless of Federal funding, it not WILL have a detrimental impact to all of their livelihood. PS. I chose not to post this comment in the Advertiser or Star Bulletin forums as one or both would delete such a comment.&&&1

Foreign policy collapse amid mocking laughter heard round the world&&&Obama's Iran Policy Collapses to the Accompaniment of Mockery Around the Globe By Joel J. Sprayregen Barack Obama, in his first press conference after his election, called Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons "unacceptable." He repetitively offered Iran "engagement." He set a deadline of year-end 2009 for Iranian compliance, now unilaterally extended another three months. Iran contemptuously and repetitively responded that it had no intention of abandoning its nuclear program. Obama's Iran policy is collapsing to the accompaniment of open mockery around the globe. Obama assured us that his "engagement" would make it easier to enlist other countries to stop Iran. The result is the opposite: Virtually every country Obama approached has rebuffed him. Without a credible threat of force, it is now clear that "engagement" has no chance to stop Iran's military nuclear program. It is indisputable that Iranian possession of nuclear weapons would destabilize the Mideast and gravely threaten world peace. Let's leave China and Russia to the end on the grounds that it may be more difficult to persuade major powers. In recent weeks, the Obama administration launched a curious charm offensive with the announced purpose of weaning Syria -- Tehran's closest ally -- from Iran. Syria has been ruled by the Alawites -- a despised Muslim minority considered heretical -- since the French colonialists elevated them to military leadership. The country has since 1970 been the Mafia-like fiefdom of the Assad family, which murdered more than 15,000 of its own rebellious citizens in Hama in 1982. Syria has been on the State Department's list of terrorist countries since 1979. Syria routinely dispatched terrorists into Iraq to kill American soldiers. Syria dominates Lebanon, from which it extorts wealth through violent means, including arming the Iranian proxy terrorist forces of Hezb'allah. The U.N. authorized an interminable tribunal to investigate charges that Syria murdered Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, in 2005. The U.S. withdrew its ambassador from Damascus in protest of the Hariri assassination. I have personal insight into this tragic killing and farcical investigation because Saad Hariri, Rafik's son, desperately asked me in Riyadh in 1998 to pass on his fears that the Syrians would kill his father to preserve their hegemony in Lebanon. What a difference twelve years makes! Saad Hariri is now Lebanon's prime minister. Seeing the weakness of U.S. policy, he now embraces Hezbollah and the Syrian forces who killed his father. -- more to follow --&&&8

Newton? Hmmmph!&&&Mr. Obama Repeals the Law of Gravity By Andrew B. Wilson on 3.1.10 @ 6:10AM This just in from the White House: Barack Obama -- the beneficent, the merciful -- has repealed the law of gravity, calling it "old science" and saying in his weekly radio address that it was "time to move on and put this slavish devotion to 17th century dogma behind us." The president drew a careful comparison between his brainstorm in repealing the law of gravity and Isaac Newton's in inventing it. Under this comparison, Newton came out rather badly. In a conversation with Rahm Emanuel prior to going public with this announcement, the president explained his thinking: "Newton was hit on the head by an apple. He awoke and asked, why? I too was inspired in my sleep. When I awoke, I asked, why not? I thought: Why not cut straight to the chase and forget all about costs. That was my insight and I came up with it entirely on my own, without the help of any props. That shows you why I'm president and Newton's just another forgotten geek on a pedestal." The president paused, giving Emanuel a moment to catch up with the enormity of this thought, and plunged ahead with his customary confidence and certitude. "Tell me, Rahm, how many times have you heard me talk about how we must learn to live within our means?" "Almost never, Mr. President. At least not until recently. But you have started to talk about it, that's for sure." "And surely you have noticed that I have been talking about some other things that are just a little bit out of the ordinary for me." "Yes, indeed. At the summit at Blair House you talked about the need for injecting 'choice and competition' into healthcare decision-making. That was a first. And then in your state-of-the-union address last month you talked about your devotion to small business and how small business is the real engine of growth and job creation in this country." "I did, indeed. And I went on to say that as long as I'm president of the United States, I won't allow our economy to come out second best to the Indians, the Chinese or anyone else. I set a goal of doubling our nation's exports in five years. What other president has done that?" more to follow&&&8

Konawaena will rely on freshmen - Sports News&&&Bobbby Awa recruits the best players from Konawaena, Kealakehe and even as far as Waimea (Galderia lives in Waimea),her brothers either graduated from or are still attending Honokaa High school (Lia lives with coach Awa in Kona). Awa would go all over the island if there was more parents out there that thought that basketball is more important then academics. When you do that, coaching is so much easier to do (just like a Punahou, where money can get the you that best). I know that Punahou was trying to recruit Lia Galderia,But if you ever say her grades from Waimea Intermediate school (D's and F's), she would never make it. But i guess at Konawaena Bobby Awa will be doing most or all of her school work. Bobby Awa is a good coach, but like i said earlier, it seems like Konewaena is the Punahou of Girls basketball here on the Big Island.I blame the parents of these kids, look at Kanisha Bello that attended Kamehameha Hawaii Campus transferred to Waiakea this year, saying that she wanted to compete for a division 1 state title (Vicky Tagligad from Hilo) was also going to transfer to Waiakea, but since getting a scholarship from USC, her plans have changed. In my opion, academics and life lessons are far more important then trying to win a state title by recruiting so hard for you program. When the Honokaa boys basketball team came in 3rd place (they got robbed in the semi-finals against Iolani), they did it with all home-grown players, as did Keisha Kanekoa for a 3rd place finish 2 years ago.&&&17
" Congress Tries to Break Hawaii in Two "&&&OPINION FEBRUARY 28, 2010, 7:04 P.M. ET Congress Tries to Break Hawaii in Two A racial spoils precedent that could lead to new 'tribal' demands across the U.S. By GAIL HERIOT AND PETER KIRSANOW -- Ms. Heriot and Mr. Kirsanow are members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Last week, the House of Representatives, in a largely party-line vote, passed the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act. Popularly known as "the Akaka bill," this piece of legislation might turn out to be this Congress's single most calamitous decision. The bill creates a complex federal framework under which most of the nation's approximately 400,000 ethnic Hawaiians can organize themselves into one vast Indian tribe. It endows the tribe with the "inherent powers and privileges of self-government," including the privilege of sovereign immunity from lawsuit. It also by clear implication confers the power to tax, to promulgate and enforce a criminal code, and to exercise eminent domain. Hawaii will in effect be two states, not one. The method used to create this tribe should make everyone squeamish. The bill delegates the delicate task of deciding who may join the tribe to a federal commission appointed by the secretary of the Interior. Ultimately, the tribe itself will have the power to expel members or invite new ones. Earlier versions of the bill demanded that the secretary appoint only ethnic Hawaiians as commissioners. In the current version, only those with "10 years of experience in the study and determination of Native Hawaiian genealogy" and "an ability to read and translate ... documents written in the Hawaiian language" may serve on the commission. These commissioners will examine an applicants' backgrounds to ensure that only "qualified Native Hawaiians" with the right amount of Hawaiian blood join the tribe. To understand all of this, you have to know something about the Aloha State's racial entitlement system. The State's Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), established in 1978, administers billions of dollars generated from lands the federal government ceded to the state decades ago. These monies should be used to benefit all Hawaiians. Instead they are spent on benefits for ethnic Hawaiians, including home loans and business loans as well as housing and education programs. The protection of these benefits is what motivates supporters of the Akaka bill. Ten years ago, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a Hawaiian law that limited the right to vote for those who oversee OHA to ethnic Hawaiians. The court ruled in that case, Rice v. Cayetano, that it violated the 15th Amendment's prohibition on racial discrimination in voting rights. Rice set off a firestorm that has not yet subsided. If OHA's election methods were unconstitutional, then its racially-exclusive benefits were almost certainly also in violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Something had to be done. And it was. // tbc //&&&32

Pioneering Crusader ???&&&---------- ---------- Pioneering Crusader With hopes for academics high, Pat Hamamoto takes charge at Saint Louis School By Katherine Nichols A new era in Saint Louis School's 164-year history began yesterday morning when former state schools Superintendent Pat Hamamoto took the helm of the all-male Catholic institution in Kaimuki, becoming its first female principal. -- -- -- Russell Valente, interim principal of Saint Louis School from 2007 to 2009, a former student and the current director of alumni relations, estimated that 35 to 40 faculty members are female. "I don't think the quality of education and teaching and learning has anything to do with gender," he said. "But I think she's going to be a real role model for our guys in the way she conducts herself." ---------- But how did she conduct herself as Superintendent of DOE? More specifically why did she suddenly "retire" with ten months left on her contract? Why was the surprise announcement made at the low end of year ebb of the news cycle when few people are paying attention. Inquiring minds would give WORLDS to know.&&&2

Hawaiian legacy - Hawaii Features&&&Regarding the display of Hawaiian Kingdom political symbols after 1893 and especially after 1898 -- was it patriotism, or was it sedition? The closest analogy I can think of is the public display of the Nazi swastika in Germany after 1945. It's illegal to do that. In fact, it's illegal for anyone to speak or write anything favorable to the Nazi regime or the concept of Aryan racial supremacy. Such displays would not be regarded as "patriotic", they would be treated as socially boorish and legally criminal. The Provisional Government of 1893, Republic of Hawaii of 1894-1898, and U.S. government after that, were extraordinarily gentle in their treatment of the royalists. Freedom of the press was suspended for only a few weeks following the revolution, and then the Hawaiian-language newspapers cranked it up again and started spewing their royalist propaganda without being in any way restricted by the new government. Even during her period as a prisoner in the Palace in 1895 for conspiracy in the Wilcox counterrevolution, Liliuokalani was given the freedom to sew her political protest quilt which included the monarchial flag and political slogans. Tolerance of dissent does not change that dissent from sedition into patriotism.&&&82

If legislators don't understand economics, as Kalapa says, maybe we should have minimum qualifications that people running for office need to meet. In the mean time, Kalapa should be having economic classes for all new incoming legislators. "Mr. Bertram, can you explain what is bankrupcy?"&&&13
STILL BLAMING BUSH !&&&Can you BELIEVE it? He must truly be desperate: WSJ QUOTE WASHINGTON--President Barack Obama said lawmakers shouldn't move forward on health-care legislation until Massachusetts's new Republican senator takes office. "Here's one thing I know and I just want to make sure that this is off the table: The Senate certainly shouldn't try to jam anything through until Scott Brown is seated," Mr. Obama said in an interview with ABC News. "The people of Massachusetts spoke. He's got to be part of that process." ABC released excerpts of the interview, Mr. Obama's first public comments on Mr. Brown's Senate win on Tuesday. Mr. Brown's victory takes the seat long held by Edward Kennedy out of Democratic hands, ends the Democrats' 60-seat supermajority, and deals a setback to Mr. Obama's agenda, most notably his hopes of passing a sweeping health-care overhaul. The president told ABC that lawmakers should "move quickly to coalesce around" parts of the health-care bill that both parties can agree on, "core elements" that include insurance reform. "The health-insurance companies are taking advantage of people. We know that we have to have some form of cost containment because if we don't, then our budgets are going to blow up," he said. "And we know that small businesses are going to need help so that they can provide health insurance for their families. Those are the core, some of the core elements of this bill." On the Massachusetts election more broadly, Mr. Obama said Mr. Brown benefited from the same voter mood that put him in office. "People are angry, they are frustrated. Not just because of what's happened in the last year or two years, ***** but what's happened over the last eight years." ***** UNQUOTE&&&197
Tiger&&&A lot has been said about Tiger. Yes! Infidelity affects everyone one way or the other even if one is not involved personally with the issue. His actions brought a lot of disappointment to many because he was looked upon as a role model. As for me to forgive him I don't need to because he caused no offense to me and I'm not about to throw the first stone. God is the forgiver of sin. For those who are throwing the stones they need to be careful because they don't walk on water as the Scriptures say, "Those without sin cast the first stone" Tiger took full responsibility for his own actions and not blamed anyone for it either. Tiger learned a lesson, It does not pay to commit infidelity. Further, it was no secret to all who knew what he was doing. Why didn't they speak up then then to wait until it got exposed to knock the guy down. Frankly I don't think there were many who liked Tiger anyway in the golfing world. Bet they really like the idea he got caught. Hey, what goes around comes around.&&&19

ANOTHER ATTACK ON OUR HOMELAND&&&Little Rock Fort Hood Detroit ....and now this -- after Obama has been in office little more than a year. Terrorists the world over must be dancing with glee to think Obama is giving them this unprecedented opportunity to attack us whenever they feel like it. Notice how quick Obama is to deny this has anything to do with terrorism...just like he did after the attempted Christmas bombing. U.S. NEWS FEBRUARY 18, 2010, 5:11 P.M. ET Pilot May Have Targeted IRS in Austin Crash By RUSSELL GOLD, BOB SECHLER And EVAN PEREZ -- Write to Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.com, Bob Sechler at bob.sechler@dowjones.com and Evan Perez at evan.perez@wsj.com AUSTIN, TexasThe pilot of a small plane that slammed into a building here Thursday morning might have deliberately targeted the offices of the Internal Revenue Service after a tax dispute, federal officials said. The pilot, Joseph Stack, 53 years old, appears to have been the same person who posted an anti-government manifesto Thursday on the Internet, suggesting he planned the crash, government officials said, though it was too early to be sure. "Violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer," the person signing himself Joe Stack wrote toward the end of a tirade against the IRS posted on his Web site. He described himself as a contract software engineer. The crash, which apparently killed the pilot, sent two men in the offices to the hospital with burns. An IRS manager was missing after the incident, according to one of his colleagues, Richard Lee. Police said they continued to search the Echelon building, where about 190 IRS employees worked. The crash came about an hour after an explosion at Mr. Stack's home shortly before 9 a.m. in a subdivision a few miles from the crash site, according to neighbors. The house was quickly engulfed in flames. Mr. Stack's family declined to comment, according to police officers answering the door at a house across the street from the burned-out home. The White House said that President Barack Obama was briefed on the plane crash after noon, and that the incident didn't appear to be terrorism-related. "The whole building shook; it felt like a car hit our building," said Camille Ziegelhofer, who works at a software company in an adjacent building to the crash. Mr. Lee, the IRS manager, said the explosion blew out the windows and knocked him to the floor, bruising his back. He helped others in the building get out, he said, but couldn't get to part of his floor because of neck-high flames. In a note posted online at , a writer who identified himself as Joe Stack complained bitterly about the IRS, blaming the agency for eroding his retirement savings and causing him other financial troubles. Mr. Stack, who described himself as a recently married, struggling, contract software engineer, said in the posting that he left Los Angeles, where he couldn't find work, but that he didn't have much better luck in Austin. Because of his expenses and lack of income, he didn't file a tax return, prompting an IRS audit that cost him $10,000, he wrote, and he had other problems involving unreported income. He signed it off with this: "Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well."&&&9

New details emerge about deaths in sweat lodge&&&I live in Cottonwood, Az and heard all the helicopters and emergency kits race to the scene 16 miles away that evening. We were left with no emergency personal for the whole day and a half while they tended to this tragedy. We were left completely vulnerable, as were Flagstaff and our surrounding towns here. If we had a life and death situation, we would have been out of luck. If Mr. Ray truly was a person of honor and understood human fragility and its limits, he would have and should have accommodated those in stressful conditions. He alone brought this on; as the testimony demonstrated that no one else did this but Ray himself. His actions were in addition, totally criminal when he left the scene. Leaving the scene of an accident you caused is a felony. It is akin to leaving a an automobile accident. Hit and run is a felony in any state. To date he has not cooperated with any law enforcement and continues to be free and unapproachable. Furthermore there has as of yet to be any charges filed by our law enforcement people. If I had left the scene of a fatal automobile accident, a warrant would have been issued. Therefore this predator needs to answer to the letter of the law of his acts of premeditated and willful and malicious homicide. Additional charges could also be brought in by Native Americans here in other serious criminal acts of conspiracy to defraud, to defame, wilts willful reckless regard to the health, safety and welfare of the Native American Nations, the People of Yavapai and Coconino County, including Flagstaff, Cottonwood, Sedona, Camp Verde, Jeome; with reckless endangerment of all therein. He has murdered five six people, and maimed hundreds for life. and he is still free...&&&6

ENVIRO-EXTREMISTS BRINGING DOWN AMERICA?&&&BUSINESS FEBRUARY 8, 2010, 10:07 A.M. ET Permits Drag on U.S. Mining Projects With an Average Wait Time of Seven Years, Companies Look Elsewhere for Needed Metals, Minerals By ROBERT GUY MATTHEWS -- Write to Robert Guy Matthews at robertguy.matthews@wsj.com Obtaining the permits and approvals needed to build a mine in the U.S. takes an average of seven years, among the longest wait time in the world. So despite having vast underground stores of raw materials, the U.S. is one of the last places miners go to start a project. At the proposed Kennecott Eagle nickel mine in Michigan's sparsely populated Upper Peninsula, the wait is at seven years and growing. Global miner Rio Tinto says the project would fill a raw-material gap in the U.S. economy, but the company has yet to produce an ounce of nickel there. Last month, a state agency issued a final order making state water, air and mine permits effective, but Rio still needs a federal water permit. And the company expects challenges from environmental groups. Overall, the U.S. is tied with Papua Guinea for the longest approval process among the 25 top mining countries in the world, according to Behre Dolbear Group, an international mining and mineral advisory group. In Australia, a huge mining center, the process takes an average of one to two years. The length of the mine-approval process means that the U.S., while having the reserves as well as the market appetite for metals and minerals, remains one of the top importers of the materials from Australia, Brazil, Canada and Africa. "We are becoming more and more dependent on metal imports in the U.S.," said Luke Popovich, spokesman for the National Mining Association, an industry group. Imports into the U.S. for selected metalsincluding gold, copper and zincrose 8.7% from 1998 to 2008, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The time frame in the U.S. isn't necessarily reflective of tougher laws. Australia and Canada have environmental laws for mine building that are on par with U.S. rules. But mine building often draws more opposition in the U.S. than in those countries. Part of that is due to mining's checkered history and reputation for pollution, abandonment and sometimes-shoddy management. Mining companies in the U.S., have cleaned up their management for the most part, but reputations haven't caught up. Emily Bernhardt, ecologist and assistant professor at the biology department at Duke University, says a focus on the length of the permitting process in the U.S. is misplaced. "The length of time it takes for permitting is almost irrelevant because they are not always looking at the right issues," she said. This month, Ms. Bernhardt co-authored a scientific paper calling on the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to stay all new mountaintop mining permits. One issue is the permits focus on mainly local mining-site environmental impacts but don't take into account impacts far from the mine site, she said. // tbc //&&&38

Honoring Mayor Fasi&&&I never voted for Mufi and never plan to. But I sure respect him for the many accomplishments he was not afraid to stand up to. But what is so outstanding is that Mayor Mufi honored Mayor Fasi while he was alive, gave him all the credit he deserved as Mayor of the City & County of Honolulu, let Fasi turn the lights on the City Hall's Christmas tree and said, "You made this possible," name a building after Fasi,and was not jealous of Fasi's accomplishments like some other former Mayors. I know Cayetano was not jealous of Fasi. If fact the guy liked Fasi. Thank you Mufi for acknowledging Fasi while he was alive. What benefit is there to honor and say all the words when a person is dead.&&&2

How much do cosmetologist make in Hawaii.&&&In 2008, the U.S. News and World Report magazine recognized that the U.S. job scene has been changing for a long time. Increasingly, bachelor's degree holders have been experiencing increased difficulty finding jobs, mainly because companies continue to send business and technical professional jobs "offshore." Secondly, as the majority of high school teachers push students to go to college, there's a decreasing supply of professional services workers, skilled in the arts and crafts. Therefore, the changing work environment has seen a significant demand for women and men with a career-focused education whose abilities stand out in the arts and crafts - just like Cosmetology and Esthetics. The Paul Mitchell Beauty Schools are vastly different in their approach to education compared to their competition. Paul Mitchell has a culture based educational experience. They provide the most current curriculum and also have classes that appeal to ALL types of learners. Paul Mitchell starts training you on how to become a complete professional from day one! Vital Statistics According to the NACCAS Job Demand Survey: 6,203 salons responded to a national survey. These are their statistics. National Average of Salon professionals salary (Not including tip and gratuity)$35,973 Hawaii Average of Salon professionals salary (Not including tip and gratuity)$40,578 Hawaii salons plan to hire this year: 1,758 employees. Broken down by percentage: 45% cosmetologist, 10% estheticians, 10% skin. There were more than 71,269 professionals working in more than 11,975 beauty salons, skin care salons, nail salons, and barber shops nationally. Since 2007 The number of salon professionals is up 24% The number of salons is up 5.6% The number of workstations/chairs is up 9% The number of employees leaving their positions is down 12% The number of new hires is up 37% Culture is a key component that makes Paul Mitchell schools differs from their competitors. The Learning Leaders and Admission Leaders are uplifting, encouraging, creative and full of energy, just like the atmosphere at each school. The Paul Mitchell Schools are highly involved in charitable donations, events and guest artists. Guest artists include all kinds of inspirational speakers, not just Paul Mitchell ones.

Review: Cart Care LLC&&&I have to give it to these guys. They're terrific. I didn't have to worry about finding a way to get my cart to them, they were mobile and came to me. They were in and out in no time. Even though the hourly rate was slightly higher than others I called, they were able to come to my rescue the same day! The amount of work they did in that first hour is good testament for the higher hourly rate. This is what the guy did. Pulled up, introduced himself, I showed him the cart and told him what happened. He looked at it and did a few test and next I know the cart was running all within that one hour. Best yet, they trusted me to say, "the office will send you a bill". They don't know me yet they trusted me to pay them. Really nice people. No hidden charges in the bill either. These guys are terrific.&&&7

New details emerge about deaths in sweat lodge - New York Times&&&What is it that compels white Americans to be so gullible to others of their own race and ethnicity ?? Most of the "American Indian" practices that the western media and "new age" charlatans push are nothing more than bits and pieces of different tribes' practices from entirely different periods of Indian history and different geographical regions. The whole monolithic and sterotypical image of feather headress, leather loincloths, teepees and "sweatlodges" are just a concocted image sold to neurotic Americans who are desperate to spend money on whatever self-help fix that they saw last week on Oprah. Forget everything you were ever taught to believe about American Indians- it's wrong. The story you think you know is a false one put forth by the white Americans who decimated my people by disease and whoever was left, they subjugated with deep systemic and institutionalized racism.&&&9

Fishing Registration Hawaii&&&The Hon Advertiser has an article today about registering recreational fisherman in the state of Hawaii. In it- "Registration is required annually, and no fee is being charged this year. However, an annual fee of between $15 and $25 will go into effect in 2011. Native Hawaiians who fish are required to register but will be exempt from the fee under a provision for "indigenous people."" I wonder if this will include one drop of blood? Also, the article says that there are over 300,000 recreational fisherman in waters between 3 miles and 200 miles from shore in Hawaii. Then later is says that less than 10% of the phone book contains recreational fisherman. Those numbers don't add up. I think it won't affect me or others with commercial fishing licenses though.&&&3

The Hawai'i Supreme Court judged the way that they did with fairness and reason to the people whereas the Superferry sunk themselves.

Then on page 4: "We also found that the legislation on behalf of Hawai'i's Superferry compromised the State's environmental laws and set a worrisome precedent for future government accomodation that puts the interests of a single business before the State's environmental, fiduciary, and public safety responsibilities." As usual the true culprits are not held accountable for their actions and the people are blamed once AGAIN.&&&123

Goodbye, Cocaine&&&While searching for old stuff, I came across this on the Editorial page from 2007. I hope the writer is doing well today: Goodbye, cocaine -- you weren't worth it Dear cocaine: I am writing this letter to admit to myself that by knowing you I have nearly ruined my life. When we started our relationship near 25 years ago, you were fun to be with, you always picked me up when I was down and using you never failed to chase away my worries. Although you were an expensive date, up to a thousand dollars a day, I always enjoyed your company. You made me feel good, at least for a while. Only I am responsible for my choice to use you; now I must pay further for that choice. You took away my business, my job, my health, my family and my self-respect. I chased you, I needed you, I begged and I stole for you, I nearly died for you, and now I am in prison because of my love for you. I have applied to several treatment programs. They tell me that if I work hard, I can break away from you. There are no words to express how much I hate you, in spite of how much I love you; I despise you, I hope and pray to finally be rid of you. Goodbye, cocaine.

Bioenergy plan in works&&&Ask your legislator to stop requiring ethanol in gas if the ethanol comes from corn. And tell your congressman to stop producing ethanol from corn as a fuel. With a little research it's soon apparent that it takes two gallons of fuel to produce one gallon of ethanol from corn. It's absolutely wasteful. The only part of the corn being used is the kernel. All the energy and fertilizer used to grow the rest of the plant is wasted. That's why there's a push to use switchgrass or sugar cane. Much more of the plant is used. If the rest of the cellulose is converted into methanol then it's even more efficient. But it takes political will to overcome the lobbyists that force the corn option upon this country.&&&103

Civil unions may get quick vote at Hawaii Capitol&&&QUOTE Opponents, noting that this is an election year, cast doubt on claims that passage is at hand ... "It's up to the people who oppose civil unions to remind the legislators that they work for the people," said Garret Hashimoto...."There's no ifs, ands or buts that the majority of the people in Hawaii oppose civil unions and gay marriage." ....it's difficult to measure public sentiment. The last time voters directly weighed in on a related issue was in 1998 when 70 percent approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Legislature to reserve marriage for opposite sex couples. UNQUOTE So the question comes down to this: has the widespread public support for traditional marriage between one man and one woman expressed 12 years ago diminished sufficiently for the passage of a bill many see as the nose of the camel under the tent whose real intent is to fundamentally redefine Marriage? If so, the measure will likely pass with little notice. If not, the passage may be a very windy channel indeed, one fringed with the treachersous rocks and shoals of adversity and cross currents aplenty.&&&20

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Is the far right continuing to control the GOP? Led by those such as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, they have done everything possible to align themselves with hate groups. They apparently dislike the president due to his race, opposed Sonia Sotomayor due to her race, and they oppose a woman's right to choose. They stridently oppose the rights of 50 million people to have health care." Many Democrats agree with them. Still they are not spokespeople of the Republican party. "What has happened to the majority of Republicans who don't agree? Are they afraid? Why won't they stand up for middle America and those who value love versus hate, diversity, health care for all, and a clear separation between church and state?" Limbaugh does not speak for the Republican party. He speaks for himself. He is also a radio personality. One of his jobs is to stir up drama to sell ad space. "Limbaugh recently compared the Democrats to Nazis, yet the Republican right wing's propensity toward hate-mongering is extraordinarily dangerous. When 90 percent of the Germans failed to act, the Nazis took over the government, which won on lies. It is crucial that moderate and liberal Republicans take back their party." It's amusing that a Democrat is telling Republicans what to do. Again... Limbaugh is NOT our spokesperson. He speaks for himself. Stop listening to the media LOL&&&77

Cigarette tax picks on most hopeless - Features&&&I don't see anything wrong with taxing smokers for affecting the health of those around them. They may be "pathetic addicts," as Charles Memminger states, but I still don't feel sorry for them. It takes effort to quit an addiction, but many people HAVE successfully quit smoking. It can be done.&&&56

Homeless family finds language, new culture additional barricade&&&Just give them a few one way tickets back home to Chuuk. That will end their homelessness and stop the prolific bleeding of Hawaii's limited funds. No education, no money, no nothing.....why should taxpayers support these leeches and parasites. We hae enough of them already in Hawaii. Starting at the big square building on Beretania street.&&&4

The Rail&&&Years ago Frank Fasi wanted to get the rail going. All the "wise who think they knew what they doing" (the politicians) shut him down. How cheaper it would have been years ago. Just think, it would have been in service today and with a route servicing more than what is planned now. So the idea of rail did not orignate with anyone else before or after Fasi.But credit to our present Mayor. He has been the only politicial person who has given credit to Former Mayor Frank Fasi (while still alive) for all the that we enjoy today. Honolulu City Lights for starters. toot toot&&&1

"Luxury tax could bolster budget"&&&Waianae contributor Carolyn "Shammy" Dingus (letters, Jan. 25) claims Hawaii is No. 1 in the United States in the number of millionaires per household then goes on to suggest the best way to treat them is as victims, taxed to the max. Pretty short sighted, stupid and self defeating when you stop to think about it. The thing about most millionaires is that they dont keep their money in their mattress. Instead they spend money, a lot of money, that is income for those providing goods and services. Not only that, but people who are wealthy or on their way to BECOMING wealthy run for profit companies that provide JOBS in the community. And what will wealthy people do if short sighted nincompoops DO succeed in taxing them to the max? Hey, Dummy! Theyll avoid this place like the plague and the rest of us will be the poorer without them and their wealth creating, risk taking abilites. The favorite Democrat Party gambit after playing the divide and conquer race card is to play the divide and conquer class envy card. Class envy is an intelligence test. Those who buy into class envy flunk every time. No wonder Hawaii Democrats dig in their heels and resist every effort to provide our kids with a decent public education. Properly educated, the electorate would throw these political BUMS out on their keisters in a New York Minute.&&&1

Once flying was fun , now it is about as enjoyable as going thru a double root canal ! Full body scans , rude security people , long lines , extra charges for carry on bags , extra charges for airline meals , soft drinks , miserable old bitches that are now stewardesses who act more like they are guards in a prison than working for an airline ! Travel anywhere on the airlines is an ordeal !&&&4

They must help themselves too.(Star-Bulletin's article has more info)&&&2

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Guam buildup needs union jobs" Give me a break. "If you are OK housing our military in substandard facilities" I have seen a lot of union work and just because one is a member of a union there is no saying their work is any better than anyone elses....just more expensive and in the case of Guam using Hawaiian unionized labor, way, way more expensive. You are wrong about the cost of living on Guam...it is much lower than Hawaii. Ask the former tuna packers. They were doing fine until Uncle Sam stuck his nose in and said the federal minimum wage now applies to Guam. Guess what, no more secure jobs because the plants shut down. The workers were fine with what they had. You can tell Neil for me that he can quit handing out OUR money like it is his own personal piggy bank to repay all the favors the unions have given him over the years.&&&40
MONEY-MERGE ACCOUNT SCAM&&&The money-merge account system in a NUTshell...you go INTO more debt(paying them "fees" to do so) to pay off other debt (paying them more "fees")...then you grab your balls and HOPE your HELOC doesn't blow up when they adjust the rates back up as they are going to do very soon...LOL! This is too funny! Anybody that falls for this OBVIOUS scam is nuts! This, from the link above... "it looks like their 'program' is... 1. Pay them $3,500 to: 2. Take out a mortgage with them and pay fees 3. Take out a HELOC with them-pay more fees 4. At the beginning of every month, transfer 1 month's worth of your paycheck (the amount of ALL the money you'll earn that month from working), minus your expenses from the HELOC to the mortgage as extra principal 5. Write checks against the HELOC for all your bill payments 6. Every time you get a paycheck, direct deposit & transfer the balance cover the HELOC debt. In other words, you don't really have money in the bank, you pay everything with debt, and every dollar's immediately going to cover some more debt." lol!!!!!! The scam is (among several)...that they have your money, and they have your house as collateral. YOU have new debt, on top of old debt, to pay them interest on your risky as hell, rising interest rate debt. But, oh....I forgot...they PROMISE you it works by "magic". LOL!!!!!!!!!! Put them all in jail!&&&2
Specter's defection reveals GOP flaw - Editorials&&&The GOP increasingly is staking out tale positions on the Bell curve. By doing this, the GOP is putting more and more distance between itself and mainstream Americans, and reducing its statistical chances of winning enough votes to carry elections. Furthermore, the GOP's inability to carry on a civil discourse on any issue alienates even people who may otherwise be sympathetic to GOP views. The GOP's disintegration is unbelievable. Rather than learning from its mistakes and responding adaptively, the GOP continues to say things and do things that hurt its own cause.&&&121
Massive devastation&&&Only four ships have been able to dock at the pier, where 15-inch-wide (40-centimeter-wide) cracks make it risky to let more than one truck work at a time. The port's cranes are now destroyed or tip dangerously, and damage is so extensive that military officials say they don't know how long it will take before ships can dock and unload in large quantities. "I wouldn't even ask my workers to risk it. I don't trust it," said Georges Jeager Junior, a businessman who plans to shift his port operations to Cap Haitien, the country's remote second city far to the north, at least 12 hours overland on horrendous roads from the capital. Jeager Junior said that means prices will soar. Damage at another port are limiting fuel shipments. No tanker has been able to land since the quake at the country's badly damaged main oil terminal, on the edge of Haiti's most dangerous slum. That has forced gas stations to depend on tankers driving in from the neighboring Dominican Republic.&&&3
Pro Bowl recovery - Hawaii News&&&The NFL Pro Bowl needs to stay in Hawaii for the simple reason of the game being insignificant in the eyes of the players and fans. Why would the players be interested in playing this game in a city that they travel to during the regular season in the dead of winter? Keep the game in Hawaii, reward the players, coaches and their families with a fun week in paradise while playing a little football in paradise. Let fans travel to the islands to experience paradise while watching a game that they are passionate about. If the NFL wants to make the game more accessible to the fans, the NFL should partner with an airline company and offer consumers a Pro Bowl package.&&&15

In Article 1, Section 3 it states: "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the State on account of sex.

The constitution of Hawaii says HB 444 must be passed even if churches want to keep perpetuating bigotry.&&&13

Letters to the editor - Letters&&&Germany Calling, Germany Calling:....... Good heavens! The moose appears to be on the loose up there in Vancouver, B.C. with the Ruymar 'ohana. Looks like they intend sampling the mele of Quebec cajun in preference to the rumbustious peacock mele of Hawai'i nei. One wonders have they since their initial 1954 vacation accrued the knowledge as to whom was arguably the most important figure in 19th century Hawai'i? His eminence wishes to direct your attention to the forthcoming PBS segment on Joseph Nawahi coming to you at 8.30p.m. on Thursday June 25th next. A self-taught attorney, legislator, artist, and advisor to H.R.H. Lili'uokalani, He was the publisher of the newspaper "Ke Aloha 'Aina" which supported the lawful Hawaiian Kingdom & which challenged the then unlawful government and later illegal republic of Hawaii. His wife Emma was at the forefront of the Ku'e Anti-Annexation petitions [see: ] For the Samuel Pepys diarists among you it is a chronometrical datum worth scheduling to develop an understanding of the improprieties of Hawaiian historical revisionist implausibility and the domino effect in todays 2009 Hawaiian miasma.

Beltin' Elton - Hawaii News&&&Nice. The early 70's was when Elton John first made his presence known in these Islands and later blowing folks minds with his revelation of his lifestyle. However, his music transcended the labels affixed and ascribed by those who understand their perception of reality in a manner given to boxes, cubbyholes and categories of convenience. So many great tunes from this artist over and throughout these many years and, I see, enjoyed by those fortunate to have witnessed his craft at the NBC. A product of England, a Country whose ties to these Islands extends back to the days of the arrival of Captain James Cook himself, sailing under, and bearing the flag of, King George the Third, of the United Kingdom in 1778 or otherwise two years AFTER the Declaration of Independence of the United States from the United Kingdom. In that regard, Sir Elton John's performance simply re-establishes and re-affirms (in his own super-artistic manner), the connection between England and these Hawaiian Islands. Perhaps not. But, unarguably one heck of a good show, that's for sure.&&&24
User's manual for the mind - Hawaii Features&&&Mahalo Nancy Arcayna for this feature, highlighting Sunny Massad's "Untherapy" wellness work! We are only in control of two things; what we think and how we behave, Massad said. I absolutely agree!

UH can balance budget without gutting faculty - Hawaii Editorials&&&As a union and faculty member in the UH system, I agree with everything in the commentary except the possibility of raising tuition.The Star-Bulletin reported last Monday that "the average debt of 2008 graduates at UH-Hilo and UH Manoa is $15,156, a 21 percent increase carried by the class of 2007" while on the national level "student debt increased by 6 percent." I still remember those days when I went back to college and managed to work my way through school with tuition and fees at the state university set below $100. Without that low cost, who knows where I'd be now, but it probably wouldn't be a tax-paying member of the community. Save, protect and encourage our students. In this troubled world, we need them.&&&18

Rainbows blasted by Aggies - Hawaii Sports&&&The sooner we terminate Nash the better the program will be because, if you look at his body of work for the past two yrs. incl. this year, the program has gradually been going downhill and it is on a tailspin that needs a change quickly before , shades of Von Appen, the men's basketball program become the dreg of the WAC. To Bobbi Curran & Artie Wilson, two sports announcers who extolled the hiring of Nash and proclaimed that the coaches poll which picked Hawaii last in the WAC this season is all wrong and Hawaii is better than that, both of you should contribute your salary in buying out Nash's contract as none of you have any, I repeat, any credibility with the public. Yesterday's loss was ABSURB, PATHETIC, AND HUMILIATING 'n if the news media or the A.D. come up with silly excuses that its hard to win on the road, or its not Nash's fault but the players, or injuries etc...etc...then the A.D. needs to be released also. C'mon UH admin. show some "profile in courage" IN MAKING A CHANGE LIKE ANY RESPECTABLE DIV. 1 PROGRAM WOULD DEFINITELY DO IN THIS SIMILAR SITUATION. Nash should actually quit for the better of the program and let Larry Farmer, one of his assts. and a former head coach at UCLA, implement his system and see what he can do as Nash has proven over the last 2 and a half yrs. he is not qualified to be a head coach. Nothing more 'n nothing less.&&&17

Add in also the fact that the Parisean are arrogant and stuck up you get a unbearable place to visit. No matter where you go in this city you see homeless and these people are the type that will follow you harassing you for money. Yes we have transplanted homeless mixed in with a few locals in Waikiki, but at least they know when to stop bothering you. In Paris they are arrogantly bothersome and if you refuse they follow you cussing you in broken English. Our homeless are really mellow in comparison. I guess people don't realize that our problems is mild till you visit other places in this world where things are really different. Talk about a shocking discovery along with French drivers which is all together another subject we are angels.&&&4

Gonda is framed, lawyer claims - Hawaii News&&&What Prosecutor Bell apparently does not know, or is pretentiously downplaying, is that the two teenagers who were in the same car (and therefore accomplices) and who will testify against Gonda, are probably members of the same Gang that Gonda and those other guys Gonda was riding with, involved with, and squeeled on in that home invasion robbery. So, just because the two rats were not part of the home invasion, does not mean they are not in the same Gang as those who were part of that home invasion robbery---and talked or still talking to them. You know how "Gangs" work. So, Bettencourt's defense is a good one and imports reasonable doubt that, if Bell keeps up with "oh, no, not the same Gang 'act,'" and the jury picks up they are being misled or lied to by Bell, Gonda is going to walk. Scott Bell should deal with this up front and, if what Bettencourt says is true, this case should be dropped today. If not, and Prosecutor Scott Bell knows the two rats are lying to frame Gonda for murder, Scott Bell will have to deal with the consequences. Maybe he will get away with it. But one day down the road, at the very least, the memory of such an atrocity of framing an innocent man, will have devastating repercussions on him and his soul.&&&23

Henderson unifies WEC title | Hawaii Mixed Martial Arts | Honol...&&&A good all-around card. WEC is stacked with talented fighters. Faber looked 85% like his 2008 self in beating a talented and dangerous Raffy Assuncao (Raffy has an underrated talent for hand control. He stymied Faber a lot by simply tying Faber's hands). With the quickness of both Faber and Aldo, that fight has a ton of potential. The Henderson fight had an odd ending -- it seemed as tho Henderson only had the guillotine on Varner for a split-second before Varner tapped. Still, props to Henderson. He stuck to his game plan, wouldn't bang with Varner and waited for his opening. A bit boring to watch, but tactically sound. Already looking forward to Henderson-Cerrone rematch. That won't be boring to watch at all. Good to see Mike Brown back in action too.&&&5

The specious argument put forth that fireworks is a "tradition" and has "cultural significance" has worn thin in light of the costly consequences of health risks to those with asthma and pulmonary problems, dangers to children and property, and increased costs for fire and police protection, not to mention just plain irritation to the noise for both people and pets. The use of fireworks is a vestige of a pagan ritual of the past that has no place in densely populated areas in a modern society. How many people do you think are honoring their cultural heritage as they set off fireworks? The legislators should summon their courage and ban fireworks. Let us have only public fireworks displays by trained pyrotechnics in controlled settings for all to enjoy safely.&&&20
Stricker rounds into form as Sony arrives - Sports News&&&It is outrageous that many of these PGA prima donnas play in the event on Maui then blow off playing in the SONY! Boy, life's a real bitch isn't it? Heaven forbid they stay an extra week in paradise with a chance to win a million. The local golf media pretty much gives them a big juicy free pass.

Burglary-arson case shocks community - Hawaii News&&&May I make a wild guess? Don't you think the suspect lives close by like right down the street and has a clear view of the house? The woman probably wasn't home because her car wasn't in the garage. Yes how interesting. At first I thought there must be drugs involved, but now I feel the suspect is a young amateur with too much time on his hands. Also I feel HPD has it under control. Now let's see how it pans out?:)&&&75

I think they are going to make a example of Joe, and rightfully so.&&&1
States loosen rules on tests for high school diplomas - Hawaii ...&&&States should stop expecting High Schools to teach the basics. Develop an entrance exam for High School. If an individual cannot pass the entrance exam, they remain in K-9 until they can do so or if of a certain age can switch to a trade school/alternative. This will ensure that those in High School have the necessary tools to actually learn what is being presented to them.&&&1
Senators expect movement on Akaka Bill - Hawaii News&&&For 10 years the Akaka bill has always been passed by its committees in both the House and Senate. That's no big deal. It has happened in the 106th, 107th, 108th, 109th, 110th, and 111th Congresses -- a total of 6 times in each of the House and Senate. But it has never passed the full Senate, and hopefully it won't pass this time either. I'm sure they'd like to "pass this as quickly as possible." They've been saying that for a decade.&&&45

Energy efficiency pays off - Here's the Deal&&&After our home energy audit back in late 2007, we began to collect ideas people use in their own homes to reduce their consumption of heating, electricity, water heating, home cooling and clean water resources.

Aerial enforcement - Hawaii News&&&As New Years approached I really prayed for rain. Apparently the man upstairs granted my wish because it did rain in Manoa. Everyone thinks HPD was sleeping on the job but as we see they were out there against all odds. They did indeed make some arrest and issue some viloations.I believe that some who called them chickened out when it was necessay to file witness reports. These firework enthusiast when seeing a patrol car in the area that they were firing from hide like thieves in the night. Well I am glad another New Years is over but next year is on the horizin and we have to have a full ban of ariel fireworks in place by then. If not I have to back to praying again on New Years eve.&&&92

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&DeBusca, It must gall you to admit that Rush bragged about the service he got here. He never said one word pertaining to, "I got mine, now you shut up." You are degrading the Queens hospital and all the medical personnel on this island by making statements like that. There isn't a hospital here that would refuse you treatment. I have lived in 6 states and received excellent medical care in each one, on insurance that I bought and paid for. Not the government. Yet, you seem to want the people to blindly follow this adminstration into an abyss of expense. You think it is okay to pay for something for 4 years before you get to use it without knowing how or what or even if you will get treatment when you need it, all while ignoring the high cost. You think it is okay to force the 85% of the population to go on to the HC system when they are now happy with theirs? Why should we have to give up something we earned and paid for? There has been nothing fair or transparent in this bill at all and yet you want us to sign up for it? If this bill is so wonderful, why the secreacy, why the bribes and payoffs? Why the need to lock out the other party? Why all the strong arm tactics? Why threaten another man's wife about her job. Yes, this sound like a wonderful medical plan. Why no checks and balances? Why should be go into such a debt, this country will never recover. You should really stop and try to think for yourself and ask intelligent questions. If you are one of the people that feel entitled, well, I don't care to pay for you.&&&177

Jobs, not civil unions, is focus, Lingle says - Hawaii News&&&It's just typical of Madame Governor Lingle to say it's "inappropriate" to discuss civil unions at this time. Civil rights for all people is equally important as the economy. Besides, if the Governor had been doing her job, instead of just looking out for herself, Hawaii wouldn't be in this economic nightmare as we are today.&&&149

Inouye confident Akaka Bill issues will be resolved - Hawaii News&&&<"Certain changes had to be made because of constitutionality," said Inouye.> The entire Akaka Bill is unconstitutional. The Hawaiian people will be a people without a constitution nor a bill of rights. The State and Federal government will appoint a government body with absolute rule. We will have no freedom. They did it to the Native American Indians and Eskimos. With Obama as president they will now do it to the Hawaiians. What will stop them from doing it to everyone? The wheels are already in motion.&&&160

I am greatly disappointed that he continues to try to advance his political career. He was our representative in Makiki yet he had a mortgege on a house that was NOT IN OUR DISTRICT. He is a political opportunist who TRICKED us into believing that he actually lived in our district. He also FAILED to adequately REPRESENT the majority in much of his legislative voting record!&&&2
Big bangs - Hawaii Features&&&Since mostly everything comes to Hawaii via Los Angeles, the ICE needs to start x-raying containers that come in from China, before they are shipped to Hawaii. This is especially essential from August to November before the new year. It is ridiculous that the police are asking for the citizens help in trying to catch these criminals, when the police say they have to catch them in the act, and are too lazy to patrol the areas that report the incidents. Why dont they have the detectives go out to the areas where complaints are made, and stake out the area in plainclothes and with video cameras.&&&66
Award recognizes couple for inspiring work in China - Hawaii News&&&A mixed blessing. China is an oppressive country that suppresses free speech and expression and killed protesters and burned their bodies on the spot at Tiannemen Square. They also invaded Tibet. Sun Yet Sen, was not a communist, he was anti-Monarchial and overthrew the Chinese Empiracal Dynasty. However, the communist regime appropriates Sun Yet Sen's identity in their historical development. Sun Yet Sen studied in Hawaii, at Iolani, I believe. He was a true servant of the People. What the hell happened to mufi?&&&10
Mystery relic in search of a home - Hawaii Features&&&" ... a secret gift of royalist solidarity from Queen Victoria"??? "Maybe Victoria sent it to the deposed Hawaiian queen as a kind of royal-sister solidarity gift." That's a fabulous conspiracy theory, and typical of the genre. Total baloney. So far as I'm aware (I'd like to be corrected if I'm wrong), the real Queen (Victoria) never communicated with the ex-queen (Liliuokalani) after the revolution of 1893. But more importantly, in Fall 1894, after the Republic of Hawaii sent out letters requesting formal diplomatic recognition de jure, Queen Victoria personally signed a lovely letter to Hawaii President Sanford B. Dole recognizing the Republic as the rightful government; and she signed her letter "Your friend, Victoria" Photos of 20 such letters personally signed by emperors, kings, queens, and presidents, including Queen Victoria, can be seen at Royal-sister solidarity gift? Total nonsense.&&&4

Clinton to deal with Japan row - Hawaii News&&&The U.S. should be re-evaluating the need to keep ground forces (army & marines) in Asia and Europe. They have been stationed in those areas since World War II (60 years) and things are different now. The U.S. should only be concerned about a major world war which will be nuclear and involve the air force and missiles. Any small conflicts the U.S. should not get involved because the U.S. will once again get bogged down in a never-ending conflict that cannot be won. Besides, the U.S. spends far too much money on the military and it is bankrupting the country.&&&3

Lawler/Manhoef official, Penn in Abu Dhabi? | Hawaii Mixed Mart...&&&Chicken **** guys like Floyd Mayweather is why boxing is floundering and MMA is flourishing. After Arum's announcement that the "Big Fight" is off because of Golden Boy promos unwillingness to negotiate leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth for the sport I grew up with and loved. His "jook and jiving" about olympic style drug testing was just a ploy to kill the fight. The existing NSAC testing policy should be adequate, which Pacman is willing to agree to. Pacman has been the only thing that has been keeping boxing alive. Even Mayweather's fight with Marquez was interesting for everyone because we all wanted to see what Mayweather would bring to a future Pacman fight. Instead he brings his ugly "brother gotzta get paid" routine back to the ring.He should have opted for the WWF instead. I hate to say it, but if Mayweather does not agree to a fight with Pacman sometime in the near future, this will be the final nail is boxing rapidly closing closet.&&&4
Hawaii topples No. 1 USC - Hawaii Sports&&&Hawaii just outplayed USC. I don't think that it was even a close match, though USC looked good in some parts. If USC is really #1, Penn State #5 and Ohio State #10, Hawaii has got to be in the top five - they are surely better than #12. I haven't seen Irvine or the others yet, but they almost beat Penn State and handily beat USC. It may be early in the season for signficant rankings, but they need to get it right so the men don't suffer the same fate as the women in the tournament and get a bad seed.&&&8

Na la nui o ke Aupuni Mo'A - Hawaii Editorials&&&The best Kingdom holiday that should be celebrated is January 17, in honor of the revolution of 1893. Those celebratory devices remaining after New Years can be put to good use -- fireworks, noisemakers, party hats, and the little paper umbrellas that decorate a mai tai. It's a real stretch to have a holiday for Leleiohoku, also known as Billy Pitt. He died at age 23 and thus had very few accomplishments. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment is that he died, thereby opening the door for his sister Lydia to be named crown princess to succeed Kalakaua. But then, she didn't turn out to be so terrific either. Actually, since our nation is the U.S., those wanting to revive the royal holidays might consider celebrating the birthday of King George II.&&&10
Hair wanted for children's wigs - Hawaii Features&&&Donating hair is a great cause. But Locks of Love only helps kids suffering long term hair loss, which doesn't include cancer kids. They have a surplus of hair and a lower charitable org. rating then some others that do help cancer kids. Wigs for Kids is one such org. with a high charitable rating. Better to spread the resource around to other lower profile orgs. Perhaps the organizers of this annual event can look into a change up?&&&3
Don't raid hotel tax funds - Hawaii Editorials&&&Since Mayor Mufi knew there were going to be deficits this year, why didn't he start furloughs or pay cuts last year? Instead he raised every fee imaginable including: propert tax rates, vehicle registration fees, sewer fees, the state GET, parking meter rates, bus fares. he is bleeding honolulu county citizens to death but he still wants to raise taxes and continue to carry out the rail construction when he knows it will require more raises in taxes because it is broke.&&&10

She shifted her offer 2x on critical issues and if she preferred a negotiated settlement why did she move on unilateral fashion. All the campuses CFO had indicated that the respective campuses are solvent as long as there is no further cuts. Greenwood has a plan for every negative program in management but no plans to get the UH functioning, prevent buildings from crashing down, pay faculty a competitive wage likened to that she negotiated for herself, etc. When her term for president at UH is up, is she returning to be a full professor at $75,000, the sum she offered!

Don't forget nutrients when resolving to diet - Hawaii Features&&&I've discovered a great natural supplement in Muscadines! Muscadine grapes have the highest levels of resveratrol and antioxidants when compared with any other element in nature. I've been taking NutraGrape (sister company to Duplin Muscadine Winery) and have seen steady improvements in my digestion, metabolism, cholesterol and even with menopausal symptoms. It also helps that the medical community is starting to come out with more about resveratrol and other items found in grapes, like improving mental and heart health. NutraGrape rocks the boat when it comes to a single supplement packed with power. Duplin's Muscadine wines are also a hit at my house. Here's to your health!&&&3

K. Mark Takai - Hawaii Editorials&&&You know, all this fuss about ban, no ban is rendered all but meaningless UNTIL a guy like Takai steps forward. Takai articulates some compelling arguments for outright ban, but it is his service and integrity, and his working with our service members that has earned him my support now to ban these fireworks. This "cultural" argument is kinda mostly bogus anyway, except for a very narrow segment of the population that can demonstrate a continuous historical link back to the days the chinese started blowing up stuff back when Ghangis Khan went about riding roughshod while raping, pillaging and plundering their country side. To everybody else, it is really about "making big nose."

Late run propels Farrington - Sports News&&&Riders need to address their turnovers. 24 turnovers is ridiculous, but not surprising, they average about 18 a game, so I guess it business as usual. What's up with that? The Govs defense didn't stop the Riders, they stopped themselves with their turnovers.&&&1
Mililani fire intentionally set - Hawaii News&&&Strange story indeed! The person starting the fire knew someone was sleeping in the house? Four different fires started? The neighbor knew what telephone number to call? There is a lot of questions here that the occupants may need to answer including the landlord.&&&32
Penn State outlasts Hawaii - Hawaii Sports&&&Valiant effort by our team. Penn State had higher hitting percentages and more blocks. Maybe we need to bring in Strotman for the USC match. Last year he was instrumental in the Senior's night win against USC as he was recognized by Hawaii Telcom as the player of the evening. Perhaps it would also help to substitute more late in the sets when Hawaii is down to allow our key players to rest. Umlauft never got a chance to rest and he was blocked several times in the crucial fifth set. He needs fresh legs to give him a lift over the block. Glad to see that Steven Hunt was called in to substitute Gus Tuniaga in the front row. Gus is best at the back row as server and passer, while Steven Hunt, two inches taller, can get kills more rapidly. In one single set he got four kills while it took Gus three sets to get that many. I'd like to see them alternate like this permanently just as Stephanie Brandt used to substitute Stephanie Ferrel in the back row. Brandt was a better server and passer while Ferrel was a much stronger front row hitter. Well, it's just the beginning of the season and no need to despair because of one loss. That's where coaches keep fine tuning the rotations and learning what works best.&&&1
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Replying to Dan Fox's letter. I wish it were as easy as picking up a phone but often it isn't. Most times the offender is not right next door to the complainant but several houses removed, or perhaps in the next block. You know it went up from a general area but can't point out the house or the individual. Plus there is the risk of retaliation on the part of the offender. The police won't be there to protect you. People are justified to be fearful. You were lucky if you only experienced a "few strays" in the days preceding New Years Eve. Perhaps if you endured what some other areas have, you might have a different opinion. I think everyone would agree that if fireworks were set off according to law, then the call for a ban would be very much diminished. But it seems we are headed in a different direction with heavier duty stuff showing up in ever increasing quantities.&&&2

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Lots of controversy on naming a landmark after president Obama. Mr. Richards claim that yes he was born here but is actually from Chicago.For this reason he should not get something in Hawaii named after him. Many born and raised here have gone to the mainland where they made a name for themselves. His discouragement for that reason seem to cover a underlying reason for his opposition. Many dislike Obama for varying reasons that maybe personal. The bottom line is he is the President and was born here in Hawaii. This distinction alone is good enough for me, and although I am disapponted in some of his policies we should name something after him.&&&19

China turns drug rehab into a punishing ordeal - New York Times&&&I am happy the commie chinese demonstrate here their backward, oppressive, government "intervention" style of rehabilitation, that merely reveals their almost cave-man state of sub-intellect. For all you granola eating, peace niks that want to sing around the campfire like a bunch of girls with our enemies, you should remind yourself that this is the same Government that invaded Tibet. Cannot go, "Oh, Dalai Lama, you da man, I like mediate and become one with the Universe," but then say, "Oh, our United States Government is bad for taking on China or any other government that wants to trample on basic human rights." This Chinese Government MURDERED their own citizen at Tiannemen Square and burned the bodies on the spot. To this day they deny it happened and to this day they cannot account for how many they killed or burned. But here, their medieval cruelty TODAY shows just how ignorant they truly are. Yeah, so what we owe them a Trillion Dollars, it's all that crap you buy at Wal-Mart too. But, hey, China, Welcome to the Free Market. You lost on your investment. Let's see them come over here and try to collect it.&&&19
Mayors ask state to leave hotel tax - Hawaii News&&&Guess what folks? If you dwell in Honolulu, and are silently going along with mufi's rail road robbery of your 7.2 BILLION DOLLARS you haven't earned nor paid yet, your property taxes are about to shoot you through your roof and out into the street below or, if you're lucky, you can join the tent city at Kapiolani Park. Let me get this straight. Plenty cash if you perpetually in dept tax payers of Honolulu and saddle them with a train that will obsolete by the time it may be completed, BUT not enough cash to pay our cops and put food on their table. It is a disconnection between delusion and reality. Where are the priorities here. First things first. That TAT is a STATE tax, that was given by former DEMOCRAT Governor Waihee to reward the other DEMOCRAT mayors at that time in Hawaii's dark history of one party domination. Without the TAT now, mufi is looking to rob YOU just so his cronies can continue to feed at the public trough. "Dire economic straits" the article correctly quots as saying. Who disputes that?&&&71

Sad to say parents are having too many children when they are too young to take care of them and learn how to take care of them before they have them. How they expect the police to protect them is another quandary when the average cop is more interested in how he can kill a big buck in the forest and mount it's antlers over his mantle. When the cops are less predatory is when our society will be safer from child molesters...&&&2

China turns drug rehab into a punishing ordeal - Hawaii News&&&The Chinese most certainly take a different approach to their drug problems. Its a madatory 2 year stint in their so called drug rehabilitation center. Once there you get no group therapy or one on one counseling. You will be put to hard labor, feed scraps and housed in a jail like setting. America should revamp our method and model it after theirs. They believe in teaching a lesson that leaves bad memories when you think about relapsing once you get out. Those stories that if you get caught stealing you get your hands chopped off are very beliveable.&&&4
Mayor and governor trade barbs over rail&&&Mayor Mufi Hannemann implied yesterday that he is viewed unfairly whenever he assails critics, such as anti-rail leaders, because of his racial background as a Samoan leader. Why does the Mayor have to bring race into the picture? This has nothing to do with race and it's very unfair for our Mayor to even mention it. Why does he feel bad for being a Samoan? His remarks are not even fair to the Samoan people. There are many great Samoan people out there trying to make Hawaii a better place to live. Please don't bring race in the picture. If everyone hated Samoans then you would never have been elected Mayor. Also because of his remarks about being Samoan he just opened a floodgate of tension and I suppose that was his point in the first place?&&&568

Fresno lays record loss on Wahine - Hawaii Sports&&&Nice to see that FSU coach Adrian Wiggins still has no love for UH. He hated Jim Bolla and would run up the score whenever he had the chance. I didn't think he had the nerve to embarrass a Vince Goo disciple (I know that he has great respect for Vince), but he kept his starters in the late stages of the game, continued his full-court press and kept shooting 3-pointers. I guess it's true that a leopard never changes his spots. I hope Wiggins is still around when UH delivers a big time beatdown payback.&&&21

I agree, these were some of the loudest I have ever heard. In Ewa Beach, the people were held hostage for weeks. They were one decibel short of military ordnance put into a dumpster and lasting until 4 in the morning. Don't give me the the ole, this is our culture stuff. Is it your culture to be so rude and uncaring to your fellow man? Is it your culture to drive animals into a frenzy and children into seizures? Please, let us work together on this. Stop the long weeks and hours of fireworks and please use only legal ones that do not rattle the pictures on the walls. In the right time and place, they are wonderful.&&&19

Three qualified rail technologies (other than steel wheels on steel rails) were brushed off in a paragraph of the 2,000+ pages document. If the (not yet released) final EIS does not cover those technologies in depth, then the document should be rejected by the governor. This should not be for political purposes, but just to ensure that every effort is made to acquire the most operationally effective and cost-efficient rail system available for our taxpayers and commuters.&&&10

makua valley&&&Why does no one make comments about Sunday's front page story of using Makua for anti-IED training? Makua valley lends itself to Vietnam Era training which seemed not to have helped. IED training needs detection and electronic ignition which is taught in an electronic/physics setting. Conventional Tactics hearkens back to Civil War/Revolutionary War Era Tactics. This is only useless occupation until your land realty divisions are created.&&&1

Court bolsters public access to beaches - Hawaii Editorials&&&No doubt this will work its way through to the State Supreme Court as the Appeals Court has left many open legal questions regarding their ruling. More importantly is the belief by many that the State's claim to beachfront property will somehow benefit the public. With ownership come responsibilities and typically, governments set up bureaucracies to handle their responsibilities. Bureaucracies require funding and that in turn implies the need for fees levied upon the public to feed the bureaucratic beast. You need to look no further than Hanauma Bay to see what the future brings for the newly acquired State beaches.&&&8

Happy New Year....SUCKERS...and don't forget to vote for me...your next governor or congressman! Ha Ha&&&7
'Bows buck Boise State - Hawaii Sports&&&fire the coach. even when we win, it's pitiful. boise state was horrible. they can't shoot, from the field or from the line. as for UH, nash has to recognize that Balocka and Hiram are the reason for this team's success. there is no way that Balocka should be limited to 7 minutes in any game from here on. in the first half, he tried to rest balocka and hiram and boise literally steamrolled over us. in the second half, boise's press almost killed us because Nash refused to take Mayen out of the game. Mayen is not a guard (he's not a forward either, but that's another story), he can't dribble and he can't pass. boise came back only because Mayen kept turning the ball over. once Lay came in, we didn't lose the ball once from their press. nash has got to get a solid 8-9 man rotation for the WAC season. hiram will be worn out if he has to continue to play 35+ minutes a night. flemings, balocka and campbell need rest as well. mayen should be the shooter off the bench. he should not be starting and/or playing 30+ minutes. williams, lay and adams need 20+ minutes a night.&&&4

Ex-prosecutor Kubo tapped to be circuit judge - Hawaii News&&&I am very pleased with this nomination, partly because Mr. Kubo comes from a background as prosecutor rather than defense attorney. Too many judges started out as defense attorneys and then, as judges, gave far too much leeway to defense attorneys during trial and were far too lenient in sentencing. Remember former Hawaii Judge Sandra Simms? Remember Judge Ito in the O.J. Simpson trial? Mr. Kubo has been responsible for finding and arresting some really bad guys, and then prosecuting them vigorously. Hawaii needs more judges who have a strong law-and-order orientation.&&&18

UH students' debt load rising - Hawaii News&&&If it's not clear to you already after seeing a global economic meltdown caused by the gluttony of financial parasites, it should be. The entire system has failed to produce anything resembling improvement in our lives for years: Median male incomes today are the same as they were in 1974 in the US. No progress has been made despite a doubling of productivity and massive top line GDP growth. Female incomes aren't on par with male incomes. The typical American family makes much less per hour worked than in 1974; All of the requirements for entry into the middle class are now private expenses. From health care to a college education, if you can't afford the minimum, you aren't allowed entry. Worse, those expenses are spiraling out of control. Nothing is being done to address this. The system is geared to make us fail. Not only has outsourcing/off-shoring just started (everything that can be moved offshore to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in wage disparities between western and workers in developing countries will be) we are being laden with un-repayable debt. To wit: there's been NO job growth in the last decade (despite tens of millions in population growth) and total debt from all sources is still near ALL time historical highs. To add insult to injury, efforts to correct any of the above through governmental or regulatory reform have failed miserably (the government and both parties have been captured by transnational business interests): from endless bailouts to industries actually writing the legislation that covers them to guarantee rich profit growth while solving nothing meaningful (as we saw with both the recent health care and finance bills). We are at a dead end. So, take control. If you are underwater on your student loan (by a lot), meaning the loan is greater than two years salary, walk away from it. Since your contract is with the global system, it's a business decision and not a moral one. Don't be an idiot. You'll never qualify for the credit needed to buy a home. Forget it. Scissor the credit cards. Pay cash. Reconfiguring your life for an accelerated future will likely require downsizing the property/things you own from the old economic/societal. Get used to it. You were lied to about the value of an education and especially lied to about the value of enslaving yourself to a lender to get it.&&&36

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Aviation terrorism is not going away. Installing these new devices are necessary for flight safety along with canine sniffing dogs. We should get used to it folks. Patience is going to be needed at airport security points. Better safe then sorry. Bambi's suggestion that we should model our intelligence after the Israeli system is right on. These guys know how to operate with terrorism, after all they have been playing this game for decades. Racial profiling is a necessary tool also. I know it infringes on civil rights, but listen we are being targeted as Americans which is the same thing. They want to kill us so who is really profiling who? Let these agencies who suspect any involvemnet with these terrorists even the slightest suspicion walk home from where ever they may be. We must be vigil when traveling and watch out for each others safety. Airline travelers have had enough of these jihadist. These recent attempts show we are not just going to sit there without springing into action to save our fellow travelers. Lets show them we are not afraid of them and we are willing to fight for our freedom.&&&33

Big bangs - Kokua Line&&&Why wasn't this the lead story in the newspaper? Why did it get dumped into the Kokua Line column? HPD's complete and utter failure in stopping illegal fireworks was the single biggest factor in decreasing the quality of life for thousands of people over the last couple of weeks. The police chief wants the public to help? Is he admitting he can't do his job? It's not rocket science. Many of the explosions are coming from the same location for several days in a row. How hard could it possibly be to figure out who is doing it? Other people are shooting aerials into the sky. That's like a bank robber walking into the bank with a flashing red light on his head. The real problem is not that the public doesn't help but that HPD is too lazy and dumb to do its job. The police don't have to catch everyone - just bust a few easy targets and make a well-publicized example out of them. That should send a message to the rest of the miscreants. But that would actually take initiative and effort - two things HPD avoids like the plague. That's what you get from a police force with a chief who got his college degree from a strip mall diploma mill in Aiea. Not exactly the best and the brightest. If he can't, or won't, do his job then find someone who can.&&&9

UH wants to avoid 0-2 WAC rut - Sports News&&&Platoon! Let's shake it up! Start Kurtz, Ji, Mayen, Lay and Lutu. Maybe they can generate some energy at the start of games. Of course let's not forget Adams .. I think he can be a spark-plug, too. That may pump up the next 5 coming in: Flemings, Campbell, Balocka, Thompson and Williams. Maybe platoon substitution will give the players much needed rest, a sense of "team" and build healthy competiton. Go Bows! Let's deny the Broncs this evening!&&&4
UH wants to avoid 0-2 WAC rut - Hawaii Sports&&&Nash is uncommitted to an up-tempo style of basketball. He talks it in the preseason; that's probably a recruiting tool he uses. But he doesn't go through with it. If the players seem unsure of themselves during the games, trying to run a halfcourt offense, it's not their fault. Hiram Thompson is a gamer, Roderick Flemings has shown his skills, Dwain Williams can score. Paul Campbell is about the only guy who gives anything on defense, unfortunately. But when I see UH play, I see a team that doesn't get enough coaching in what they need to be doing on offense. Nash can only talk the up-and-down game, but he can't coach it. So players go into the game untaught, and end up stuck in the halfcourt. And Nash just stands there and watches them fail. He can't even call timeouts right.&&&12
Letters to the editor - Letters&&&McGuire why Kapiolani park? If they want a local Hawaii experience should they not go to Waianae? Their savings could be shared with the locals instead of Haoles. Locals like beer and cigarettes just as much and they could get to know some of the people born here. As far as panhandling the locals out there wouldn't stoop that low. They would just take away their money without asking. Why would they want to come and meet the same kinds of people they could associate back home? Since your too cheap yourself to house them let them have the true Hawaiian experience.&&&39

The demand is there for locally grown food - Guest Editorials&&&It's shame that the people in Honolulu seldom get to taste the sweet and flavorful strawberries that come from Kamuela. Although they are not as large as the berries that come from Southern Cal, they are every bit as sweet, just as if you were there picking your own. The growers here need to promote their fruit and vegetables with the Chef's and restaurants in Honolulu. No more green mainland strawberries for me. It's a shame that the Superferry never got a chance to come to the Big Island to help the producers of fruit and vegetables here. Honolulu would have benefitted with the fresh produce that would have come from Waimea.&&&3
Big bangs - Columnists&&&What does the tremendous flaunting of the law prohibiting the loud salutes and aerials say about those blatantly shooting off these obnoxious and dangerous pyrotechnics? Really have to wonder about the effectiveness of all the anti terror hoopla when TONS of bombs can be so easily procured and then detonated. What confidence can one have in the security providers, from the police to TSA to the port and airport guardians, when the makings of IEDs can so readily be smuggled in and then distributed across the entire island?&&&50
Clean power future needs people power - Hawaii Editorials&&&But why nowhere does Jeff not talk about geothermal, the current renewable resouce being used on the big island to provide 25% of their power needs? He doesn't really want to provide power he wants to stir things up like when he stopped the super ferry. Can't trust this guy on anything.&&&11
The demand is there for locally grown food - Hawaii Editorials&&&Hawaii need to be independant on it self. Grow staples, raise staples and produce staples. This way, with locally grown and raised products will lower cost. Grociers won't have a reason to say, "because it comes over water." Hawaii government should take a look at other states that produce foods that feed the country and follow their example of how it's done. Then fund those that are into farming to get them started and not worry about putting it in their pockets. Maybe then, Hawaii will be independent on it self.&&&18

Asians who typically consume less dairy products have a much lower incidence of heart disease. Obesity is epidemic in Hawaii. Go figure.....&&&1
Kulani prison conversion will be delayed by 1 year - Hawaii News&&&Video surveillance and an electronic gate, "to keep out would-be intruders?" As if. I have toured that facility in the past. Kulani is so far from ANYWHERE that the notion of intruders "breaking in" is ludicrous. The enhanced security measures are clearly intended to detain and to intimidate the "students," not to exclude intruders. Although I suppose the enhancements could also be meant to minimize the over-the-fence delivery of "contraband" into the facility (cf. Hilo CCC). This "campus" sounds like a high-tech, out-of-sight gulag for youthful offenders. Lipstick on a pig, I say.&&&5

Isn't this what they do in the Midwest for varmints? There's too many birds anyway. Just like humans. This method might not have helped Sullenberger. The heavy geese were high in the air and nowhere near the airport. Must have been a rude shock to witness a flock of fat white birds in your path and not being able to avoid them. Sully was able to summon his cool training and go into glider mode. What an amazing coincidence to have the best pilot at the controls. EXTRAORDINARY!!!&&&1

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&To Walter Takeuchi, the reason we don't want our legislators to take the easy way out by raising the GET is that it allows them to get more money that they will spend foolishly. It's too easy to just say "raise the GET" and then spend the money the same way they have been, unless you think they have been doing a great job in judiciously running programs in a cost effective manner. I do however support taking the .5% increase in the GET that they are spending for rail to balance the state budget. Unless of course you think rail is also a good thing to spend our hard earned money on.&&&4
Isle fireworks permits in decline - Hawaii News&&&Permits are probably down because increased numbers of people are joining the thousands of scofflaws who blatantly violate the laws regarding fireworks with impunity. Despite their shooting off all kinds of illegal devices not a single fireworks lawbreaker was prosecuted last year or the year before, and maybe one or two importers were busted. Why should anyone purchase a permit when there is no enforcement of the laws? Given all the hoopla over security for the visiting president and the national security panic over terrorism, how is that TONS of aerial rockets, bombs, and other pyrotechnics are smuggled into the state and delivered into the hands of the yahoos? How secure can our airports, harbors, and ports be given that none of the responsible agencies stops any of the illegal rockets and bombs from entering Hawaii? The one or two sellers busted were dealing materials that already had passed through all of the supposedly strict explosive controls that state and federal officials swear to us are necessary to stop terrorists from attacking here in target-rich Hawaii. If those responsible for our safety and security cannot defeat smuggling by the locals, why should anyone trust their ability to thwart seasoned, focused, and jihad-motivated actors?&&&57

Early December on Kuhio a guest threw a chair off the 15th floor of Ocean Resorts while fighting with his girlfriend.

Of course there numbers are increasing but really how many is just a estimate. We all know that they are significant marks on them. Would it not be more accurate to photograph them with long range cameras then count them that way? Counting from shore means that some will be counted two or three times.&&&4

Obama Health Care Nightmare&&&Well, I have done it! I have read the entire text of proposed House Bill 3200: The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009. I studied it with particular emphasis from my area of expertise, constitutional law. I was frankly concerned that parts of the proposed law that were being discussed might be unconstitutional. What I found was far worse than what I had heard or expected. To begin with, much of what has been said about the law and its implications is in fact true, despite what the Democrats and the media are saying. The law does provide for rationing of health care, particularly where senior citizens and other classes of citizens are involved, free health care for illegal immigrants, free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession. The Bill will also eventually force private insurance companies out of business, and put everyone into a government run system. All decisions about personal health care will ultimately be made by federal bureaucrats, and most of them will not be health care professionals. Hospital admissions, payments to physicians, and allocations of necessary medical devices will be strictly controlled by the government. However, as scary as all of that is, it just scratches the surface. In fact, I have concluded that this legislation really has no intention of providing affordable health care choices. Instead it is a convenient cover for the most massive transfer of power to the Executive Branch of government that has ever occurred, or even been contemplated. If this law or a similar one is adopted, major portions of the Constitution of the United States will effectively have been destroyed. The first thing to go will be the masterfully crafted balance of power between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of the U.S. Government. The Congress will be transferring to the Obama Administration authority in a number of different areas over the lives of the American people, and the businesses they own. The irony is that the Congress doesn't have any authority to legislate in most of those areas to begin with! I defy anyone to read the text of the U.S. Constitution and find any authority granted to the members of Congress to regulate health care. This legislation also provides for access, by the appointees of the Obama administration, of all of your personal healthcare direct violation of the specific provisions of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution information, your personal financial information, and the information of your employer, physician, and hospital. All of this is a protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. You can also forget about the right to privacy. That will have been legislated into oblivion regardless of what the 3rd and 4th Amendments may provide. If you decide not to have healthcare insurance, or if you have private insurance that is not deemed acceptable to the Health Choices Administrator appointed by Obama, there will be a tax imposed on you. It is called a tax instead of a fine because of the intent to avoid application of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. However, that doesn't work because since there is nothing in the law that allows you to contest or appeal the imposition of the tax, it is definitely depriving someone of property without the due process of law. So, there are three of those pesky amendments that the far left hate so much, out the original ten in the Bill of Rights, that are effectively nullified by this law It doesn't stop there though.&&&3
Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&So, now solar water heaters are required to get a building permit on a new home. The initial idea of building permits WAS good, but look what a political in-your-face piece of excrement these permits have become! I think it's an individual decision on what type of water heating to install, but I suppose the tree-hugger lobbied (and maybe BRIBED), CORRUPT politicians know better than I what to install in whatever and wherever, and pretty soon they'll TRY to tell me how and when to wipe my okole. The founding fathers of the USA would all be turning in their graves if they could see what a sniveling, subservient, bunch of slaves to government bureaucracy we've willingly become! We have to take our nation back from these CORRUPT career politicians and their mandates!'Nuff said...&&&1
Letters to the Editor - Editorials&&&Hi Timothy, May I enlighten you to the wonderful generosity of go! Airlines in supporting Hawaii's school children by providing the transportation for our nonprofit organization last year. The other airlines refused and have been refusing for years to help out. But go! stepped up to the plate and supported our local community with open arms and big time aloha spirit for our children. There are always two sides to every issue but the press often denies the good news for go! because they are afraid to show a little compassion towards an unpopular opinion that may be tainted by the media. Isn't it true prior to go! Airlines arriving in Hawaii both Hawaiian Air and Aloha Air been filing for bankruptcy several times through the years? Appreciate your understanding and aloha spirit in knowning that go! has been very generous in making contributions to our community and to our children and for that they deserve a fair and balanced judgement.&&&49

Maui was voted "#1 Island in the World" 12 times in a row. But, with 1 dinky road linking Kihei/Wailea to Lahaina/Kaanapali with accidents all the time, shutting it down for 8 hrs., tourists won't come.

He lost multi-millions and moreover the prestige that comes along with the "designed by" title.

Bankruptcies hit 4-year high - Business News&&&I am sure in many cases it is people trying to SHOW OFF. Spending money in such a way so they can feel more important than they really are. Such arrogance. Such spending comes in the form of new cars, going out all the time, buying larger properties than what is reasonable instead of being conservative and moving up because they wanted a huge pay out when property appreciated, regular vacations, etc. Sorry not much sympathy from me except for those with medical ailments, divorces, or job losses. Many of the aforementioned circumstances could have been controlled by the person. So why the sympathy. Why should I pay for thier "big headed" attitude" in the form of higher rates? It is happening right now in the mortgage mrkt. 1st rule of wealth, make it perpetual. For example $100 in the bank making 3% will ALWAYS make $3. NEVER borrow unless it is an emergency, a unique event like a marriage, or can generate a better return than the rate paid ie bought a car because it enables a better paying job, debt for school for the same reason or similiar. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT TODAY, IT IS NOT LIKELY YOU WILL AFFORD IT TOMMOROW. There was a very good reason why so many people who grew up in the 1940's and 1950's didn't use credit and invested conservatively. THEY WERE SCARED. We may not even have hit bottom yet in the economy and it may never get as good as it got as China may become the biggest kid on the block and dictate our actions. Unlike past deep recessions our own citizens do not hold a majority of our debt so it can't be manipulted by gvt policy as easily. China holds our debt.&&&3

Instead the leadership of the HSTA would be pressured into a settlement not for the benefit of the students but instead for the betterment of the Hawaii Democratic Party! Rest assured that Mr. Yoshinaga was one of Hawaii's greatest political leaders, but new leaders would be wise to go beyond his accomplishments and build a new Hawaii that can compete and thrive in a new world economy.&&&8

Furloughs further blasted - Hawaii News&&&Typical democratic word manipulation.

And FIFTEEN states have already instituted or immediate implementation on furlough days for public workers.

Few businesses escape battering by economy - Hawaii Business&&&The bulk of the money from the gvt for stimulus hasn't even been spent yet; only the money being used to stop the banks from being insolvent. Mark my words, there will be leftover from the banks and it will be in the BILLIONS and the govt might even make a profit. On top of that, consumers have been deleveraging and once they feel it has hit bottom will start spending again and this time with sustainable growth. A good lesson to learn. Population growth will assure some growth in the future, albeit very small. Inventory on the low end of real estate is being sapped up as that was not overbuilt and it will start to trickle up the chain to the higher end properties in time. Most importantly, the economy is likely to pick up major steam in 2011 so Obama can get re-elected. I do believe democrats control both houses. Food prices will drop as the Dollar relative to other currencies get stronger as the economy in the US improves. The Sun always comes out after a storm. Things are bad so when the good times are here you appreciate it and can plan for the bad times. ALLLOOOOOOHa and Happy New Year. p.s. If this correction in the economy would have happened a long time ago when it was supposed to, this downturn wouldn't have been so severe. TOO MUCH ECONOMIC MANIPULATION trying to get re-elected. Fed has been doing work gvt doesn't have guts to do but have their backs to the wall with their 0% interest rate policy.&&&6

I have no children in school, don't earn a lot of money, and have taken income cuts recenty. Still, schools should not be viewed as a cost that can be cut. We pay whatever prices suppliers charge the state, never asking them to shoulder the burden and lower their product prices, but we demand from teachers differently? If that is what it costs to pay for teachers, then we have to come up with the money, and taxes can spread the burden more evenly. Cutting corners on education only hurts the community much worse than raising taxes.&&&18

Pollution from rail feared - Hawaii News&&&This report is disturbing. However, Rail proponents are fortunate to have learned opinion of environmental expert Kirk Cadwell offer a strong rebuttal to the findings rendered in this fatal report. Maybe Cadwell missed an election filing deadline, but he does know something about trying to continue Mufi's legacy of plundering our City's dwindling treasury, with catastrophic tax revenue decline, just so that they can enrich their gang of contractor cronies, unproductive unions, pretensious p.r. mouthpieces, as kissing architects, and various sundry of others who once hoped to cash in on Hawaii's gullible tree-hugging sector of the populace. Cedentials of the author Cox of the are unquestioned, as he consulted for U.S. Department of Transportation as well as for public agencies in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The study draws a dire prediction under a worst-case scenario, that Honolulu's greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would be about 1.36 million tons annually with the rail system, an increase of about 28,000 tons compared with emissions without rail, according to the study. The worst-case scenario assumes a more gradual decline in the use of fossil fuels for transportation, which, of course, takes into account Cadwell's typical knee-jerk reaction and his weak attempt to discredit the report. In the best-case scenario, in which 70 percent of Hawaii's energy is derived from renewable sources by 2030, greenhouse gas emissions would decrease 12,000 tons by 2030, the study said. "In the best case, rail would marginally reduce greenhouse gas emissions at an extremely high cost per ton," the study said. "As a strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Honolulu rail line is exorbitantly expensive." Pay attention folks: "at an extremely high cost per ton." Folks, in the best case scenario, this rail will not do for the environment what mufi and his team of hacks have been lying all along to say it will do. Just like how the city, only when pressed, will admit that this rail will not alleviate the traffic it is being sold to do. So, if you look at this mufi thing, both in terms of the sales pitch of 1) cars off the road and 2) eliminating greenhouse gases, their effort to fleece Honolulu tax-payers, fails on both counts. Regular posting mufi hacks, from kailuaresident aka "I make up my own facts," to BuildRailNow aka "I used to work for a contractor and want an increase in retirement pay if this is built," and the other fools that will try to discredit this report. All of this is beside the point. Rail will turn Honolulu into the Ugliest City in the World, and destroy the last open space on the Ewa Plain, and change our Honolulu into a City unrecognizable as having once been Hawaiian.&&&363

Parents and schools should combat childhood obesity - Hawaii Ed...&&&Childhood obesity is a disease my family has been struggling with for years, from before I was born. Its difficult to have healthy children when the parents are not providing the proper building blocks to do so. Parents lack the knowledge and information necessary to control the progression of this disease. Most primarily because they are obese themselves and it has been a way of life for them throughout their childhood. But what can we do? How can we raise funds to develope a program to conquer this epidemic? Who do we need to contact?&&&1
Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&"A $326,148 federal grant will support child care for low-income parents who are studying at the University of Hawaii at Manoa...."

It's been said, "A million here, a million there, and pretty soon we're talking some serious money" -and- "A small leak will sink a great ship" -and- etc, etc. Oh well, they JUST DON'T GET IT!

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&If I could have a New Year wish come true, I would wish for wonderful things to come to you. I wish you all happiness in everything you do, I hope not many worries or problems will come to you.

May you rise each day with sunlight in your heart, And may all your hopes and dreams never fall apart. I wish that all your joys, and wishes will come true.

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Helen Reich's excellent letter extolling the virtues of our Honolulu Symphony and admonishing local businesses to contribute to this 109 year old worthy institution, is admirable. Especially since her letter hails from Milwaukee, Wisonsin. However, the Honolulu Symphony caters largely to an affluent audience who like to show up all hoody-toady, in their foreign import luxury automobiles, making like there some kind of royalty, looking down their noses on the less fortunate too embarrassed to go to these symphony concerts because they are poor. Essentially, the Honolulu Symphony's economic health is a reflection that the upper class audience, with all their finery, are essentially a bunch of cheapskates unwilling to help the Honolulu Symphony when it counts, and would rather spend their disposable income buying cheese and expensive wine for make like they the new age royalty of Honolulu.&&&36

It's his 3rd season now, and his teams still don't seem to know what his offense is all about. If he doesn't figure it out real soon, he won't get to his 18 wins, and it'll be his last year!

Health care bill denies freedom of choice - Hawaii Editorials&&&Well put.

Tentative teachers deal reached - Hawaii News&&&What part of of the law does everyone including the author of this story ignore? The law specifically prohibiting using THIS money to pay for cost items in any collective bargaining contract...the "rainy day" fund law. So next time we come up short, for anything, let's tap the rainy day fund. That's a plan plan ripe for disaster. Why can't the DOE cut from the 10,000 administrators? There are 14,000 teachers why does it take 1 administrator for every 1.4 teachers? And just one more question...with the state already looking at nearly $1 billion shortfall when is the discussion going to take place of the $3,000,000,000.00 the state lost of the state employees' retirement system, that is required to be paid back(lost in the giant Ponzi scheme of the Wall Street collapse)? Just asking because no one seems to talk of that money...and I understand we have to pay it back.&&&45
Seniors and hospitals win big in reform bill&&&"Barry Rand, AARP national chief executive officer, in a statement. In 2008 there were more than 193,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Hawaii who typically spend 30 percent of their income on health care, according to AARP data." According to Barry - a $500 BILLION cut to Medicare (which AARP supported) will HELP seniors. Only the federal government and AARP accounting can make that work. Do you think, just maybe, Barry sells 'supplemental' medicare insurance? Now it starts to makes sense.&&&2

Close air security gaps - Hawaii Editorials&&&"The security system should allow travelers to feel safe on international flights without being subjected to undue harassment." A few adjustments to the system will allow travelers to feel safe. However, to really BE safe is another matter. There are more thn a few who will not fly if the screening includes the probability of a thorough strip search including examination of body cavities. The alternative is to remove toilets from aircraft, which may have some drawbacks. Either approach will take Hawaii tourism to pre-1960's levels.&&&12

Health care bill denies freedom of choice - Guest Editorials&&&Dr. Carlson, I was surprised at your comments since Hawaii has required you to provide health care insurance for you employees for over 30 years. By living here you have forfeited your inalienable rights...and hence your liberty. But then, I guess it's difficult to take seriously someone who cares little for the 15% of the population that lacks adequate health care. Perhaps in Waislae there are no homeless or people who have lost their jobs and health care insurance. BTW, have you decided to count yourself out of Hawaii as well, given our compulsory insurance requirement? Michael Tanaka&&&1

After all Chicago is where the president lived for over 20 years and rose in politics. The community organizer should stay in the ghetto where he made his rise in politics.

Hawaii is perfect for 'Longevity Tourism' - Guest Editorials&&&The big problem with your naive proposal is this. Hawaii has so many long-living folks because of the high percentage of people of asian ancestry. That fact combined with the cultural diet of asians...lots of fish and rice...little bit (if any) red meat. This is what gives Hawaii an edge in longevity.... That plus.....we never shovel snow. But you cannot bottle and sell the asian/cultural stuff to the rest of the world--especially the western world which has none of the attributes that gives many in our population and edge in longevity. This is as lame an idea as the notion that a world class medical institution will ever move to Hawaii to set up shop. Back to the drawing board Mr. Iczkovitz.&&&17

Emotion not good basis to support assisted suicide - Guest Edit...&&&Dennis is wrong to say policy should not be based upon "emotion" nor upon the basis of "individual cases" impacted--sometimes cruelly--by the law. The Catholic Church, for whom Dennis speaks, is sometimes on the side of compassion, but has often turned a blind eye to injustice. Fortunately, most Catholics have enough independence to ignore the orders of the church hierarchy when they do not make sense. Hopefully, the legislators will not allow political threats from the Church to override their best judgment. Arakaki misrepresents proposed "Death with Dignity" legislation when he suggests end of life decisions should not be made by spouses suffering the emotional distress endured by Mr. Yagi. All such bills would have safeguards in place to ensure no such decision would be made under such conditions. The point is to allow people to make thoughtful decisions far in advance of the emotional crisis provoked by emergencies. Arakaki wants to prevent any such thoughtful deliberations, claiming it is against God's Will for families to do anything to hasten a loved one's death, preferring our elderly to waste away into vegetative states, with no quality of life and often in intense pain. The Catholic Church should not dictate our decisions as to whether to use birth control, whether we can divorce or whether we can eat meat on Fridays. Nor should they overrule our private, sometimes painful decisions, about end of life care for those we love. Dennis, butt out!&&&1

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&You got that right, Tsutsui. Although the perception is the Honolulu Advertiser perhaps may have more subscribers, the quality there does not approach that provided citizens by the Star-Bulletin. This is also expressed in the Advertiser's internet bulletin board, where some unknown hack deliberately censors views in opposition to those espoused by the Advertiser's editorial staff or that of the faceless black out artist. In stark contrast, our Star-Bulletin lets the free exchange in the marketplace of ideas evolve any given debate, hone arguments, effuse ideas and ultimately lets the citizens make up there own mind too. Support our Star-Bulletin. Meanwhile, Jason Reyes makes some good arguments about rail and is correct in drawing our attention to the "rail road job" mufi's hacks did in rigging the process to avoid those suggestions made by Reyes. Had the process been open and not tainted by politics and rewarding of mufi hacks, I would surmise there would be more support for rail. As it now stands, mufi and his team can expect every single legal obstruction, legal stall and delay tactic, every kind of environmental lawsuit, every challenge to the EIS, numerous motions, various counter-motions, colorful appeals, exciting new trials, eternal subsidiary litigation, on top of the standard "Save the Aina," "Protect the Iwi," "Protect Open Space," "Save Agricultural Land," in addition to any any other idea the audience can throw into the gears of this make work project for the politically connected painted "Green."&&&93

Recently we have been reminded of the business aspect of medical care, the greed behind insurance companies & hospitals and their power to influence legislation in the halls of Congress through billions of dollars in lobbying. Let's get back to square one on healthcare and give thanks and praise to those who directly administer the patient care in this world.

Williams' 36 not enough - Sports News&&&he plays favorites and it is costing this team a chance to win. brandon adams and jeremy lay deserve to be in the game more than mayen. he played 36 minutes against st.mary's and it was the quietest 36 minutes ever. he was overmatched against UNLV. why is he playing so much? he does nothing on defense and he is strictly a spot-up black hole shooter. on D, he can't and won't mix it up inside so he really can't play down low. but if you put him on the wings, the smaller, quicker guards just blow by him. on O, he is strictly a spot-up shooter. he can't dribble and it is an adventure every time he does. TO or traveling, ugh. he never hits the O-glass and doesn't really have the range to hit 3's. brandon adams is clearly what this team needs now when they want to go big. he's tough and bangs with anyone. balocka needs help down there. when we go small, lay should be in there to give us a three-guard attack (hiram, dwain and jeremy) that would be hard to defend. come on nash, do something about the lineup. mayen is not giving you anything! he would be good for about 15 minutes to shoot the open jumper but that's it. he's a liability on defense.&&&1

Seniors and hospitals win big in reform bill - Hawaii News&&&You are out of your mind. Nobody wins with this law. Ask Sen Akaka and Sen Inouye, and M Hirono if they will be a participant in the same bill they are jamming down YOUR throat. Nope, they are exempt. Why is that? Now why would they do this for the American people, but exempt themselves? Let's all pray this stupidity of 'reform' does not occur.&&&76

No joke: Kahuku has a kicker - Hawaii Sports&&&I was at the game. His 49 yard field goal would have been good from 55 yards. He definitely saved Kahuku in that game as Farrington had totally shut them down. VJ Fehoko was eating up Kahuku's right tackle and they had to double team VJ from the 2nd quarter on. Kahuku has no offense this year. No Div 1 running back. No Div 1 WR as they have had in the past like Spencer and Saia Hafoka. No Div 1 OL'man. Totally trips me out how a Hispanick all the way from Florida ended up on the Hawai'i north shore.&&&6
Akaka Bill changes catch state off guard - Hawaii News&&&So,under the bill, unless you are someone who actually practices your culture as determined by some high officials (the new Ali'i), you are no longer considered to be Hawaiian!!! So, what are you? Who do you have to be related to or know to be considered a Hawaiian? How much do you have to pay (bribes)? This bill is so bad, it isn't even funny!&&&159

USC overpowers UNLV in DHC title game - Hawaii Sports&&&You have to understand what happened to USC basketball since last April, to appreciate this tournament win. Rocked by a media-reported scandal involving the star at USC, OJ Mayo, four USC starters left the program, three high profile recruits de-committed from what was then considered the 6th best recruiting class, and the coach ended up quitting the job. Now mind you, the issues haven't yet been resolved, but the NCAA did not appear to be fleet footed on the matter, neither dismissing the investigation, nor moving it forward. Thus the program remains under a cloud of uncertainty. In comes a new coach and a couple of transfers. Without any expectations and without any warning, they register what may end up being the signature win for this year's squad, a 22 point win over then-8th-ranked Tennessee. With this win over 20th-ranked UNLV, USC has now beaten three teams with 1-loss, and two ranked opponents. What this team has done so early in the season, is just fantastic.&&&1

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&re: B&B Bill promoted for benefit of few. Not only was Bill 7 intended to benefit the few, it was also a smokescreen for the much more nefarious TVU operations. Angie Larson, who spearheaded the campaign for Bill 7 is actually a TVU operator. Now why would she be working so ardently to benefit the B&Bs unless she believed the TVU operators would somehow be included. Did the language of the bill somehow redefine TVUs to make them appear to be a B&B. Or was she hoping to expand the language in the future to include TVUs? Now we not only need to bury Bill 7, we need to toughen the existing zoning laws to put some teeth into a long overdue enforcement effort.&&&31
SMU a higher caliber - Sports News&&&Great performance by the Mustangs and congratulations to June Jones for restoring football prominance to SMU. As the old cliche' goes Hawaii's loss is SMU's gain. This team is full of young talent, To think that Kyle Padron (a Freshman) replaced another young Soph QB (name forgotten) and showed the kind of maturity found mostly in seasoned QBs. Jones must be in his glory to be blessed with a host of talented QBs and big linemen from the State of Texas. They will be a team to watch next season and keep an eye on the BCS polls too.&&&2

Gathering Place: Gun rights in Hawaii&&&With the Supreme Court decision in D.C. v Heller, it's now the law of the land that honest, competent Americans can not be prevented from keeping a loaded handgun in their homes to protect themselves and their families. The Constitution is clear in bestowing the right to keep and bear firearms on "the people" rather than the malitia, the police, the army...etc. With the Heller decision, this matter is settled and those who don't like it should try to amend the Constitution rather than continue to chant their a-well-regulated-mailita mantras and other nonsense.&&&71

Crying because the President of The United States is staying in an ILLEGAL VACATION RENTAL and selfishly causing all the associated inconvenience to the property's neighbors that caused the Honolulu City Council to finally defeat Bill 7 (which would have made them legal). President Obama, you are clearly send the message (by personal example) that, if you are powerful enough, it's perfectly acceptable to BREAK THE LAW on Oahu. Merry Christmas, while the rest of us are crying along with the angels.&&&4

Defense bill benefits Inouye contributors - Hawaii News&&&Oh, I see how this works. The King of Pork, so proud of fleecing American Tax Payers and saddling future generations with staggering debt, is still blatantly running up the tab, just so he can get kickbacks guised as "campaign contributions" from those who he gives our money too. At a time when our national economy is tanking, such actions by Inouye amounts to a callous disregard of the risk of continuing to run up the national deficit. Placing the entire nation in economic jeopardy is outweighed by Inouye's personal accumulation of wealth paid for by those he gives our tax money to. For those Hawaii residents proud of Inouye's conduct here, are just as much to blame than Inouye himself. I would hazard to guess they operate a foreign import automobile or truck, a chunk of which was paid for by American Tax Payers in the recent "Cash for Clunkers and Cheapskates" Democrat programme.&&&20

Collins was there from the start - Flashback&&&I grew up in Honolulu and went to high school there. In my sophomore year, 1952,I recall the excitement and anticipation of TV coming to Hawaii. My Dad bought a small TV set and us kids sat around the tube watching Wayne Collins in black and white. Reading your article on Mr. Collins reminds me of the simple life I enjoyed during that period in time when TV was introduced to Hawaii. Good to see Mr. Collins still enjoying life in Tucson and staying in shape and not bad for a guy who is what I believe to be in his late 80's. My how time is left us behind.&&&2

UHPA will fight pay cut in court, director says - Hawaii News&&&I have NEVER received an 11 percent raise. In fact, I have never received a 7 percent raise in one year over 20 years in the private workforce. The best I ever got was 3%. I have a bachelor degree in a solid field. At best, I made $80k which included lots of OVERTIME. It's too bad the faculty is out of touch with reality. Who do they think will pay thier salaries? By in large, it will be the students who pay thier salary. THESE are the very same people who are having a hard time in this 7% unemployment economy finding a job. As most know the 7% is understated due to discouraged workers who gave up looking for work and part timers who would like to work more. It is shameful that public school teachers who make less than the U.H. professors can absorb a cut but the faculty think they are so high and mighty nothing should happen to them even though the state and students who pay them are without question hurting. Astonishing since there are suppossed to be faculty that can relate to the "real world". Not a student.&&&42

Doomsday denied - Hawaii Features&&&What is really scary are these presumably scientific answers embedded in the story, above written. Instead of helping people become aware of the overall potentials, and providing them resource for dealing with any number of possible scenarios, they would basically sacrifice them to Nature. Such nature DOES have a cyclical behavior, and science has most definitely recorded these facts. Note first that NO comments have been included in over 6-weeks. Expunging public concern (and the article indicates its extreme, so where is it?) is something we the public mostly expect from the government, and it is well discussed that the government controls the media when it comes to reporting on 2012. Secondly, take very good note that I and many other speakers, in our need for concern about 2012, have taken much of our proofs FROM the science field, itself. I even go so far in my work as to obtain information from the government. Also pay attention to the words of this inept journalism, and in particular the indicatively ill-informed and supposed commentators. The fact is that 2012 is a ceremonially momentous <point> in time that signifies something, but that something has begun already. And, it will be playing out for many years after 2012. Those that deliver the message of 2012 indicate this. This has ALSO been said repeatedly, so censorship is obvious by the omission of those facts. 2012 DOES, however, mark this point as one where [we cannot go back] a comment of very great spiritual significance; everything physical and otherwise will start changing and that includes the physical earth. So, too, this is a necessary process for the spiritual consciousness change that will most assuredly ensue,... it is an absolutely necessary requirement. Consider too that the things reflected upon for 2012 have all, or mostly all, happened before. There is nothing impossible here. Where is the responsible journalist, and the responsible scientists who should be pointing out THEIR OWN FACTS? And, these events and those like them are claimed by science to be possible, sometimes even probably, and/or are DUE NOW! When journalism can be utterly whitewashed like this, that is when things get scary. It isn’t the movies we have to be afraid of, its REAL PEOPLE. I always chuckle when "someone is on from NASA. Just how many tens of thousands of folks do you suppose work for NASA? Now, and consider that 2012 subjects are taboo to study anyway, how many of these have the broad enough background in all the affected areas of science to make the statements attributed to them above? Of that handful, we can be sure they are quite constrained in what they can actually say publically. Dr. Christian von Lahr&&&4

The only way that can be overcome is for the majority of that group to voice their abhorrence of those terroristic acts loudly and often, and to cooperate with law enforcement. The paucity of protest from the Muslim community sends a loud message. Look at what it took for Japanese Americans to gain trust and respect after Pearl Harbor. That's just the way it is. Ranting and raving, and the liberal media won't change the minds of the majority of Americans. Disavowal and positive action by a large majority of the Muslim population will.&&&7

Care reform delays Obama's visit - Obama&&&It would be nice if you would report on the impact President Obama is having on our neighborhood. I live on the canal across from where he and his family are staying. I have family in town from the mainland and have one week vacation with them to enjoy our backyard, the canal, and the ocean in front of our home. The canal and ocean will be closed to all boat and kayak traffic for the duration of the Obama visit. The canal allows our community and neighboring communities access to the ocean for fishing, diving, and family boating which we will not be able to enjoy during his stay. Families that usually enjoy kayaking in the canal and surfing Castles will be prevented from doing so as well. President Obama is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The Marine Base which is home to Navy and Marine personnel has secure facilities for the President. Located on the Marine Base are North Beach and Pyramid Rock (Beach) which are among the nicest beaches in Hawaii. The Obama party is renting numerous beach-front homes with values exceeding $10M and several canal-front homes. The cost to the tax payer and inconvenience to the neighborhood could be avoided if he joined his troops on the base or stayed at Camp David like his predecessors.&&&2

Killing bill doesn't resolve B&B issue - Hawaii Editorials&&&Hawaii - kingdom of scofflaws. The operators of illegal short term vacation rentals have to be the most blatant lawbreakers of all. It's not as if you could hide the structures that are being used by these selfish profiteers or miss the comings and goings of multiples of customers every month. It is now time to enforce the laws that were enacted to prevent neighborhoods from becoming mini industrial/commercial zones and to keep areas that are zoned residential as residential. Time to form "Residential Watch Groups" that can borrow from the popular and effective Neighborhood Watch Groups. By monitoring the internet, where so many of the illegal operations advertise, and by videotaping the impacts of the tourists the evidence needed to mount a complaint log can be compiled and aggregated small claims court suits can be filed to financially penalize the scofflaws. For those who have rallied to defeat the spread of short term rentals to not continue and expand their efforts now would be to lose the momentum that must be maintained to combat the greedy, self-serving operators.&&&74

Great group to be a part of other than the assault on my intelligence with the promotion of Al Gores new religion of global warming. The majority of real scientist do not support Al's theory. We should send Al to Mars so he can preach to the Martians about the shrinking of their ice caps and how they should give up their pick up trucks. My wife says they should take that display down. Other than that, I would strongly recommend all our visitors & locals go visit this great work. Join for a year and go every rainy day and bring your friends and children.

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&What's this nonsense, "70% of O'ahu residents support B&B's"? For what gain? They provide nothing for the local community or the block they're on. The owners are becoming bigger than the cigarette lobby's.&&&16
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Marie DeSandra from Honolulu wrote: "...Surveys were commissioned to determine public support and although the vast majority of people -- 70 percent -- support bed and breakfasts, Council members voted no. What happened to representing the public?" According to the testimony at the Council meeting, those surveys were taken years ago. What happened it that the public became educated on the issue and public opinion, neighborhood boards, the planning commission and a host of other organizations "got it". Marie DeSandra from Honolulu also wrote: "...The Council was not considering changing the zoning whatsoever or allowing hotels; B&B owners live on their properties full time. B&Bs are residential." What she fails to recognize is that they are also a commercial enterprise requiring a GET Tax license and a conditional use permit to operate legally. They are by their very nature a property use that is not in conformance with the current zoning laws for residential use. Marie DeSandra from Honolulu is simply wrong in her assumptions of fact and demonstrates a complete lack of comprehension regarding the issue. It is time for Marie DeSandra from Honolulu to get beyond the denial phase of her emotions and move on to acceptance of the decision made by the City Council and if Marie DeSandra from Honolulu is operating a non-conforming commercial enterprise in her residence she might consider converting her commercial enterprise to a long term lease or monthly rental agreement which is by definition a "residential" use of her property and does not require a conditional use permit under Honolulu's zoning ordinance.&&&19

Count us in for census - Hawaii Editorials&&&I am sorry, but I just cannot agree with you here. Every time they take the census they ask for more and more very personal information about you and this year will be the worst. They will ask such things as who lives in your house, their race, phone numbers, Etc. Then once all this information is in the system every person in the world can search you down instantly by any means like by phone number, age, race, religion, street number and so on. Next any person can go on Google from any place in the world. From your local gangs, from Iran to China or whoever? Once they locate your house instantly by any means Google will show their world map and then they will hone down right in on our house. Your house will be a very clear picture like an open book and it will show from satellite if your car is in the drive way. Etc. So anyone in the world or whole universe will know who you are, how much money you have, what race you are and if you are home or not. If you not home then you are easy picking. Not me man!:) Aloha&&&9

HTA approves strategic plan 'to put more heads on beds' - Hawai...&&&Why don't Mr. Lingle just identify a random group of mainlanders say 100,000 mainlanders from New Jersy, and confiscate their federal income tax returns. That will balance the budget and end all the furloughs, the 100,000 will not even have to come to Hawaii, that way the homeless on Lingleville beach won't have to put up with a bunch of haoles poking around their beach. Better yet just pass a $1000 per car new vehicle assessment. Mr Lingles family(Cutter) business can pass that on with out it coming out of Mr. Lingles inheritance. That should do it, besides with the savings in mortgage payments that the Lingleville beach residents are saving, the new car's at their beachfront shanti will be a status symbol.&&&3

Nevada's Taua ineligible for Hawaii Bowl - Hawaii Sports&&&Another Samoan kid derailed by academics. I got a theory as to why. Most Samoans playing Div 1 football already have their career jobs lined up if they don't make it to the NFL. Jobs like stevedore, fireman, policeman, Halawa prison guard.... They don't see themselves working a white collar job, working behind a desk, working in a lab. I think college is a waste of time for most people. The Samoan working as a stevedore will make more money and benefits than the average person with a college degree will make. Somebody should take the time and check all former Tongan and Samoan Div 1 footbal players to see where they are working now, how much money they make, and if they ever used a college degree to get their jobs.&&&7

It was a wonderful film for kids and adults - made you laugh, made you cry, beautiful animation and great voice acting. I hope it does well on DVD.&&&1
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Medical costs are high in the US because Americans, relative to other nationalities, are sedentary, overweight, and eat too much of the wrong things, and doctors are very good at fixing them up. Fixing things that are broken due to poor preventive maintenance is expensive. We get what we pay for. We get cadillac care and the results show it. American health care has better outcomes for cancer, heart disease, and many other difficult to treat diseases because we have learned how to do it. Pharmaceuticals cost more because we invent more drugs that work well, and invention is expensive. Providing free repair services for more people in a poor lifestyle population, with a similar # of providers, will not lead to lower costs. It will lead to higher usage, then to rationing. Death rates in America are generally not compared apples to apples. When you take out our high rates of violent fatalities (many societies lack our urban centers' fatherless youth violence), and realize that we count every single baby, premies and all (most societies way undercount infant mortality), our populations health statistics are actually similar to many others to whom we're often unfavorably compared, and, again, our cadillac medicines' outcomes are demonstrably better, comparing condition to condition. That's why people flock here from all over the world to get that care! The accident, after WWII, that put health insurance with employment, so employers could compete for workers during wage freezes, does skew costs, but access to care is provided to the uninsured. Several thorough studies show, in fact, death rates for those without insurance are not higher than for those with insurance. HMO's were bringing costs down in the 80's and early 90's but became political whipping boys for (surprise) denying coverage for desired procedures! The debate is not about health care, it is about whether forcing everyone into the pre-paid pool of the insured is how we want to exercise our democracy's political power over a people that has generally been at liberty in this regard. Compulsion, or freedom? Much could be solved by simply requiring that the uninsured sign a waiver and agree to pay their own costs, expand charity clinics and fund direct care for poor walk-ins, limit illegal immigration, make catastrophic coverage widely available (State controls often prevent such policies from being sold), and get the insured into plans that have the patient disburse the funds directly, putting pressure on prices. Whenever someone else is paying, the price pressure is always up, not down. But when the big payer flexes muscle, prices are forced down at the cost of availability (that is, rationing occurs). People, there is no free lunch. But democratic politics exists to give power to those who promise such a meal, and as diners move on to another meal the productive in society pay the tab, later. The national debt will be a drag on our children & their children far worse than the productivity problems the letter writer frets about. National health-care runs up the debt, debases the currency, must ration care, and subjects a free people to the ministrations of an unanswerable bureaucracy at the most personal and vulnerable time, when sick. Don't make that bargain!&&&23

NCAA sand volleyball raises storm of opinions - Further Review&&&That's possibly the worst argument I have ever read. Schools not located in the southern half of the United States or on a coast will be required to build structures so sand volleyball can be played indoors, or they'll have to utilize existing facilities and cover the floor in sand. If Michigan added sand volleyball, they wouldn't be playing outdoors. And it's December. Sand volleyball would be played in the late Spring, not a week before Christmas. Temperatures will rise genius. The only key to the argument, which you failed to mention, is that not every school needs to add sand volleyball. It's not do or die. Any university that is interested should have the opportunity to add the discipline, not be forced out because Big 10 and Big 12 coaches and administrators don't want to actually work harder to help further the game of volleyball. There are zero professional opportunities for women's indoor volleyball players on American soil following graduation. Playing on the AVP is the only way a female athlete can currently compete at the professional level in the sport of volleyball on home soil. University coaches and administrators do not care about opportunities for female athletes while they're in school or after they graduate. The only thing they care about is their own jobs becoming more complex, and their programs being forced to appropriate funding for something they fear because they know nothing about. If they took some time to actually evaluate the positives and cost effectiveness, especially in regards to Title IX compliance, of adding sand volleyball, they would see it's really a no-brainer. Your blatant ommission of any valuable information demonstates the same type of mentality already shown by coaches and administrators nationwide. And you're personally proposing the removal of additional opportunities for female athletes receiving college educations with this endorsement.&&&6

Improve Hawaii's preparedness for health risks - Hawaii Editorials&&&Too bad no one checked with the Department of Health before writing this editorial, as the department is currently disputing the point rating. Hawaii does submit weekly information on available hospital beds for 100% of hospitals to DHHS, and our state does have legal opinion in place similar to other states that limits liability against organizations that provide volunteer help during emergencies. As Dr. Fukino noted, Hawaii is pleased about its accomplishments, and we also recognize that continued improvement is needed. Preparedness is an evolving process which the state dilligently works at everyday. The Star-Bulletin also made a bad error in quoting the report -- Hawaii met seven of ten indicators as did many other states.&&&3

Just as importantly, native Hawaiians are not an Indian tribe!!!! What a relief that shibai was soundly defeated in the NRC!

Maybe if this young lady would take control of her life instead of lying, cheating, stealing, and using people, then this would not happen.

Pilots and Hawaiian Air arrive at pact&&&Dear Editor and Blogger: It will be very difficult for the Legislature and the Governor to insist on a furlough and a layoff when a private sector union can secure a 5 year, 19% pay increase. In additional, the unemployment rate is down to 7%. With the HSTA, DOE, Governor negotiations for the reopening of the Friday teachers' furlough and the the consequential Friday furlough of HGEA support personnel, other unions will be seeking a better bargaining picture at the table. If the airline pilots for Hawaiian Airlines can negotiate for three years, the public sector unions should be willing to gird their loins and buckle down for the long overhaul. If it were easy, everyone will be doing it. Got to give credit to the Professional Assembly, UPW, and the HSTA. HGEA needs to request a reopening of contract talks. Their members are affected by the public school closures, not just because they are parents, grandparents, but because they are fellow workers with UPW and HSTA. Let's get busy!&&&1

AIG Hawaii gets new name, logo - Hawaii Business&&&I hope the new owner changes the company culture at AIG Hawaii. Five or six years ago we were badly treated by AIG Hawaii when it tried to avoid paying for body work after our car was broadsided by a reckless driver. The matter eventually went to arbitration and the arbitrator ruled 100% in our favor. AIG Hawaii had to pay up. In a final indignity, AIG Hawaii sent us a check whose dollar amount was barely visible. It had used a dot matrix printer whose ribbon had run out of ink. I was surprised our bank accepted the check. But it did.&&&21

43 Staff of Ex-Gov. Ariyoshi All Japanese&&&So the Star Bulletin deleted a relevant topic on the forum on why all the 43 staffmembers of Gov Ariyoshi were of Japanese ancestry just like him. Zero Hawaiian, white, Filipino, Portuguese, Samoan, Korean and Chinese - as in NONE. The reason given by his fans were that those who were best qualified for the positions were Japanese Americans and that they were chosen by merit and regardless of race. Nobody from the unrepresented race complained because they were scared of the powerful governor's political power. "They might hurt you or your family," replied a poster. Who were those non-Japanese candidates who didn't qualify. Who were the 43?&&&6

Alot of heart and talent on the UH team. Next year UH will be getting some taller players. Being physically overmatched was similiar to UH Football last game with Wisconsin. More often than not, the physical superiority usually wins out.&&&12

New rules threaten sea turtles, suit says - Hawaii News&&&Why don't these eco-nazi's just come out and tell the world the truth - they want to stop ALL fishing effort. Here we have hard validated science proving that the fishery can exist with current interaction levels but yet attorneys are taking advantage of our country's strict environmental laws to fatten their wallets. Too bad these attorney's got idiot individuals and foundations to support them. Without these jokers feeding their egos and padding their wallets these laywers would be nobodys. bottomline these greedy bast--ds are losers and posers. Like they give a rats a-- about saving any species - all about their luxury condos and jaguars.&&&1
He was among the first who served - Hawaii News&&&I can almost see the anti asian AJA haters writing their nasty comments to follow as I am the first poster. That poster POI from several areas in California will be spewing his racial rants soon. It does not matter that this politician and soldier went to war to fight for the USA. The shape of his eyes and the color of his skin is what they don't like.&&&13
Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Re: "Akaka Bill opposed by many in Hawaii," David M. K. Inciong, Honolulu. Phooey, on the Akaka bill and any other movement pressing for sovereignty of the kanaka maoli! The survival and prosperity of American native people, whether designated "a nation" or not, depend on this "ship" called the United States of America. We will either sink or float together.&&&18
Budget cuts led to escape, senator says - Hawaii News&&&Private security guards that have no powers to retain a "patient" once that patient is off-premesis? Senator Hee, I think that the lack of funds is the least of your worries. This "firecracker" has been smoldering for years. Maybe this latest escape will be the one to detonate it. Mr. Seals, if you are sharp enough to figure how to get out of there, then I think you are ready for a stay with our general population. At Halawa High Security Facility that is!&&&49

We enjoyed morning coffee in Hawaii and looked into ordering it many time but too expensive. I don't remember but 30, 40 dollars a pound. It was expensive to order. Never did. Now, to hear only 10 percent is Kona coffee, rest is other coffee beans. WHAT A JOKE AND LET DOWN. Consumers, heed. No aloha from me.&&&24

Climate Farce&&&When your attempt at recreating the Congress of Vienna with a third-rate cast of extras turns into a shambles, when the data with which you have tried to terrify the world is daily exposed as ever more phoney, when the blatant greed and self-interest of the participants has become obvious to all beholders, when those pesky polar bears just keep increasing and multiplying  what do you do? This week has been truly historic. It has marked the beginning of the landslide that is collapsing the whole AGW imposture. The pseudo-science of global warming is a global laughing stock and Copenhagen is a farce. In the warmist camp the Main Man is a railway engineer with huge investments in the carbon industry. That says it all. The worlds boiler being heroically damped down by the Fat Controller. Al Gore, occupant of the only private house that can be seen from space, so huge is its energy consumption, wanted to charge punters $1,200 to be photographed with him at Copenhagen. There is a man who is really worried about the planets future.&&&1

Decision on Maui streams deferred - Hawaii Business&&&Yeah, yeah , then no. They are putting it off until the political heat dies down and then the "company" gets what ever the company wants. Nothing has changed since plantation days. Taro patch ag is not something you can turn off and on like a light switch. Let the water flow free. If the sugar company wanted that water so bad they should have bought the water shed high up on the mountain and not just grab it when it flows down the stream.&&&4
Shared news agreement muddles TV ratings race - Business News&&&It's quite simple -- if they're not selling the simulcast to the same advertisers, you can't combine the ratings. Ratings are used to sell ad time -- but if I have to buy KGMB separately, then I'm buying 52,000 viewers, and separately I'm buying 17,000 viewers at KHNL. I can't make one buy and get 69,000 -- so a combined number is bogus. Combining the rating has no business rationale.&&&1

Holocaust tales live in son - Hawaii Features&&&With so many examples of cruelty toward the Jews, I cannot comprehend Zionists Israeli's cruelty toward the Palestinians. Israeli's illegally occupy Palestine, evict Christians and Muslims from their homes, destroy olive trees, build obscene walls and force people through hundreds dehumanizing checkpoints. The similarities are so "nazi orientated",the only thing missing is a "Star of David" on the Palestinians dress. How ironic!&&&4
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Obama may have spent years living here in Hawaii but now seems clearly to have moved on. It is likely that Chicago offered him more in that its larger African-American communities provided home, church, and social opportunities that Hawaii with its local biases does not. The routine anti-haole and not exactly black-friendly attitudes of many who live here may well have affected the young Obama. If people here feel that he is not as Hawaii focused as they might wish, perhaps it would be a good idea to examine how he was treated here when he was an unknown kid.&&&123
Vandals destroy tribute to former police chief - Kokua Line&&&Tamarisk shrub, invasive in sw US. an ecologically distructive plant that should not take hold in Hawaii.

This was in 2005. Hope someone will eradicate this pest before it spreads...&&&3

Isle death rate 20% lower than U.S. norm - Hawaii News&&&Very glad hawaiians to hear that. Mentioned that yesterday. I have seen this a number of times. The reason is they say, hawaii is closer to the equator and hawaii gets more direct sunlight than theother 49 states. Plus, sunlight stimulates your immune system. I don't mean you have to lie in sunlight for hours, thats not good, but just walking and your normal daily activities expose you to more sun. I know when wecome to hawaii we are white however, after a couple of days we start to get a tan and are almost brown when we get home...AND...we feel great. Hawaiians, you are so lucky to live there. A huge aloha from Northeast PA.&&&14

Parents demand action - Hawaii News&&&I've been passionately against the furlough fridays. Coming from a much better educational system (with a higher National Testing Average) in which I was born and raised, the entire Educational System in Hawaii appears completely outdated. Hawaii has much to be proud of in terms of it's beauty, and it's very friendly people. But, the education system as whole is frustrating. I can't help but to wonder why it is that the children, and their educational needs are secondary to a 4 billion dollar transit system. Perhaps in the next State Elections, the Good People of Hawaii might want to consider getting rid of their current Governor, who has clearly shown little to no due dilligence towards our children and their educational needs. To be honest, the Entire State DOE could use a good overhaul!&&&2

Screen Time: Premiere of 'Appletown'&&&The movie that Dylan and Cole Sprouse filmed, "The Kings of Appletown" was said to be based on Mark Twain's writings. Elmira NY is considered "Mark Twain country"! Mark Twain is even buried in WoodLawn Cemetery in Elmira, NY! His study is even placed at Elmira College! The new movie about Ernie Davis was premiered in Syracuse NY, where he attended college there at Syracuse University! What does having a premiere on the beaches of Hawaii have to do with this movie? Just because the Producer or Director is from there, that doesn't seem like a very good reason. Elmira NY would seem more logical! The Clemens Center is a great location with great accommodations for such a premiere!&&&2
Hawaii is perfect for 'Longevity Tourism' - Hawaii Editorials&&&The Mega-development pushing swiftly ahead in the Ko'olau Loa District (Ka'a'awa-Kahuku/Turtle Bay) will make Oahu a 3rd rate Tourist destination!

NO High-End Tourists will fly all the way to Hawaii to sit in Traffic Gridlock, see Cement in the COUNTRY or be on overcrowded beaches! or eat Frozen food & buy Made-in-China souvenirs! At TURTLE BAY, Vulture Fund Oaktree Capital, their creditors & local Stanford Carr are pushing ahead, possibly 5 more Large Hotels/time-share Hotels, 4000+ units! At BYU/Laie, new BYUH President Wheelwright wants to build a whole new town b/w Laie & Kahuku at Malaekahana/Gunstock Ranch!

St. Francis seeking to regain hospitals - Business News&&&HMC got screwed when it acquired the hospital. First, it took over the existing financial burden. Second, the loan holder was still St. Francis and not a bank so if HMC defaulted it went back to St. Francis. Third, HMC bought the hospitals but not the land under which they stand. HMC made poor judgement because they were already in debt even before they started. I don't understand why their financial advisor gave them poor advise. And what ever happened to the top management that allegedly took thousands of dollars from St. Francis? It's like the news just got swept under the carpet. HMC learned a very expen$ive lesson.&&&2

The Voice of TheBus - Hawaii Features&&&Aloha: Thanks so much for the story about Professor Nogelmeier and his voiced announcements on TheBus. He is terrific in his knowledge, his Hawaiian pronunciation and enunciation. Paulehia kona `olelo, loea wale no i ka puana ana i ka `olelo Hawai`i. He kumu akamai `o ia. Haole wale no kona inoa `ohana, aka, i loko kona na`au, he Hawai`i `o ia. For years, when people have asked me for a correct pronunciation of a place name on O`ahu, I have given them the pronunciation, then suggested that they take a ride on TheBus and LISTEN to Puakea. I also make that suggestion to all of my Hawaiian language students. E ola ka `olelo Hawai`i a me na inoa Hawai`i nani no. Me ka pono, Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&27

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&E.M. Litts from Honolulu is attempting to make arguments for Bed and Breakfast commerce. Litts argues about fees and taxes and ends his/her epitaph by stating "...Once unlicensed B&Bs are brought into conformance with rules and regulations, this problem will disappear." Ken Ordenstein from Kailua throws in his two cents worth of his unreferenced economic babble and therein lays the failure of the authors to acknowledge the reality of the B&B issue. The B&B industry has never been in conformance with the rules and regulations and, never will be. Further, its economic impacts are irrelevant. By its nature it is underground network of shadows and mirrors and to a great extent run by those who are capable and willing to skirt the law however they see fit to achieve their ends. These same operators put their individual wants above their neighbors while having a profound effect on their neighbor’s quality of life. At the Council meeting this morning you will see them all sitting together with their matching shirts and signs and listen to their fabrications about their relevance to society and their importance to the economy. Take notice that their testimony is all about them. They don't give a hoot about anyone in the room but themselves and they don't have a stitch of decency to acknowledge the negative impacts they have on their neighbors and the neighborhood they operate in. They will condemn and attack those who speak against their operations as seen here many times and do anything to deflect the issue of their demonstrated long term illegal and arrogant behavior. The good people of Oahu have long since run out of empathy, patience and tolerance for them and hopefully the City Council will slam the cover of Pandora's Box on their heads. It is time for change and yes we will!&&&26

Remembering Bryanna - Hawaii News&&&Hawaii's lenient judges and entire legal system have once again failed to protect the public. As far as I am concerned, every lawyer who ever requested a trial delay on behalf of a client, every attorney who allowed a lie in court as a means of some made up defense, and every judge who releases someone to our streets under the pretense of un-managed rehabilitation all have blood on their hands. You collectively have embarrassed the entire state of Hawaii. Your system has failed again and this time an entire review is warranted as well as dismissal of judges who act to defy public safety. So what benefit was there to letting this drifter out to roam our streets? Shame, shame!&&&31

A royal salute to a saint - Hawaii News&&&I enjoyed reading that the Roman Catholic church saw fit to honor Fr. Damien, a man dear to me. I spoke with lepers when I lived in Kathmandu; they lived on the street and both begging and giving to beggars was against the law. However, one finds a way. As bad and cold as it gets in that city, I'm aware that can conditions (of all kinds) were far worse at Kalau-papa, and believe that "sainthood" had been earned daily by the now recognized St. Damien. Suggestion: spell Hawaiian words correctly. Aloha.&&&2
Lingle renews push to revamp schools - Hawaii News&&&I think this is a good policy. We need this change. A change for better tomorrow for our children. We are way too far behind in academics than any other states. We need this change, it's good for us and the state of Hawaii. You've my full support in this regards.&&&226
Letters to the editor - Letters&&&I cannot believe this discussion on "B & B's" is continuing. They offer NOTHING to the immediate neighborhood except to take parking places and make noise. Granted, they will shop at the grocery and maybe eat out, but the trade off isn't worth it. They ruin the neighborhood, don't pay school taxes, or fire and police. The owners are the profiteers and probably pay .10cents on the dollar in tax. If that.&&&9

Isles received doses of recalled vaccine - Hawaii News&&&So we get our H1N1 shots from a country that hates the United States ! Now there's a re-call and we're trusting in the powers that be that this is the last of the re-calls. How do you re-call something that's been injected in to your body ? I'll bet the street drug users are interested in how this can be done, sure would save a lot of drug rehab time. Maybe they should have used that batch at OCCC. It really sad that we cannot trust the medical people that are supposed to protect us...SAD!&&&4
Hawaii not intimidated - Hawaii Sports&&&I don't blame people here for hoping for the Wahine - they are the best sport team UH can muster. But, Hawaii can't beat Penn State. They will be lucky to score 20 points in any one game. Hawaii plays the weakest regular season schedule out of the remaining four and that will be their undoing. Shoji's record against ranked teams pales in comparion to Penn State's Rose's, and even he knows that. Sorry, but the Wahine are smaller, weaker, poorer shooters and slower than Penn State. It wont even be a match worth watching. I'll be here Friday saying I told you so. Let's get to the Penn State/Texas match - that is the real contest.&&&9
Fired up - Hawaii News&&&Mahalo for this article. It is good to know that the soldiers are getting the training needed. I was absolutely sure that the troops were prepared for their deployments-and the preparations to receive help when returning home. They deserve no less. That brings up the matter of Makua. Is this not evident enough to the people of Hawaiii that Makua is NOT the only place to have live fire training? The attempts to make everyone believe that the troops would be unprepared if they could not train at Makua is just misinformation given to keep Makua within the grasp of the military....return the valley to the people of the westside as promised-promised even as far back as the ending of WWI!

Furloughs, the DOE Shibai&&&DOE has a 3 billion dollar budget. They give roughly $4,000 per student to each school to pay for everything to do with running the school. This $4,000 pays for teachers, adminestrators, secretaties, and custodians, all the way down to text books and toilet paper. This $4000 per student that makes it dowm to the schools, accounts for roughly 1/4 of the whole 3 billion dollar budget. That leaves the DOE Queens and Kings with about $12,000 per student or roughly $2,250,000,000 to run their kingdom. So they have 2.25 billion dollars to play with but they say they can't find another 19 million so they can open up the schools. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? The State and DOE are saying that the darn HSTA is to blame. Again, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Hamamoto has 2.25 billion dollars to play with and the only thing she could come up with was to close the schools. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Where the heck does the other $2,250,000,000 go? LOOK HOW MANY ZEROS THAT HAS. That is 2,250 million dollars. And they say you can't find 18 million... Nothing but SHIBAI...&&&1
National report details Hawaii's readiness for health emergency...&&&Just a thought. You people that are fortunate enough to live in the Hawaiian Islands should be more than happy about your health...generally speaking...you are the healthiest people in the United States. The reason is being closer to the equator and receiving a great amount of sun-shine daily which stimulates your immune system. I saw that on a medical program and just thought you folks in hawaii might be interested. A huge aloha from Northeast PA.&&&6

Bed and breakfasts: It's decision time - Guest Editorials&&&What Keep it Kailua fails to mention is that the so called “B&B Hotels” are already operating all over Oahu with no adverse effect. It’s not like this bill is going to “open the flood gates”. All this bill is going to do is make small, community-minded, B&B operators legitimate. Keep it Kailua should be renamed to “Keep Kailua all to Ourselves”. If B&B operators are shut down, small businesses in Kailua will inevitably suffer. Who’s going to drive from Waikiki to have pancakes at Boots & Kimo’s? Legitimatizing current B&B’s will greatly stimulate the economy because current B&B operators will then invest more in their now legitimate businesses, hiring contractors, buying furniture, fixing up not only their rental units but also their own houses and landscaping. This is good for the neighborhood, good for local businesses and it promotes the Aloha Spirit.&&&15

Business briefs - Business Briefs&&&CRAIG M. HUNT [#48040], 69, of San Francisco was disbarred Nov. 4, 2007, and was ordered to comply with rule 9.20 of the California Rules of Court. The State Bar Court review department increased the discipline recommended by a hearing judge who found that Hunt practiced law five times while suspended, did not meet probation requirements and committed acts of moral turpitude by filing a probation report and a declaration that included misrepresentations. The hearing judge recommended a three-year actual suspension and four years of probation, but the review department found Hunt should be disbarred. He was suspended in 2002 for taking a loan from a client without advising him to seek independent counsel. He was ordered to make restitution and to comply with rule 9.20 by submitting a declaration to the bar court that he notified his clients and other pertinent parties of his suspension. While suspended, he appeared in five proceedings, filed various pleadings and asked for two time extensions on the grounds that he was a sole practitioner with competing professional and family demands. He never advised the court or opposing parties that he was suspended. When he filed a late declaration of compliance with rule 9.20, it falsely stated that he had no clients when in fact he had five pending cases. He also submitted quarterly probation reports in which he said he had not practiced law during the quarter. Hunt had argued that he was entitled to appear pro per in one matter, even while suspended, because he was the owner of the economic interests of the entities involved. The review department rejected his position because it said he was not the sole owner and, in one matter, he still held himself out as the attorney of record. The court found that Hunt committed acts of moral turpitude by submitting false probation reports. Hunt also was privately reproved in 1992 for entering into a business transaction with a client without advising the client to seek independent legal advice.&&&1

Will we let the remnants of the plantation kapu our streams so they can water their lawns? Sugar and pine are a dying shadow of their glory days. We need small farmers and diversified ag, and the streams need their water back. The state prosecuted those three guys for taking pohaku from Maui streams for their imu on O'ahu, and it would be a sick joke if they let the luna steal all the water. I mua Hui o na Wai Eha!&&&7

Farm finds home in Waikiki - Hawaii Features&&&I went to Kai Market for their Thanksgiving spread. Majority of dishes were executed well. They served up the pan fried Hawaiian sea bass with thai lobster curry sauce mentioned here. Nadine is spot-on with her take on the dish. It was a standout. With respect to sides, the crab and Molokai sweet potato salad was ono. The kalamansi lime tartlet wasn't shy with the acid (something I loved as most citrus tarts are far too sweet devoid of tartness). The tart could have done without the meringue that sat atop though. Too bad Kai didn't offer Ted's choco/haupia pie during the night of my visit. I would have made a beeline for that as well.&&&1

Wait a minute thats 2 counts in the first degree, and 1 count 3rd degree assault. The bail was $100 bucks which to me should read $100,000 bucks, Are they serious? Is he someones relative? This is already a injustice. This takes the saying innocent till proven guilty to far .&&&6
Wie lives up to the hype at Solheim - Hawaii Sports&&&The late George Carlin once remarked that "golfing is an arrogant sport." I tend to agree with Carlin that the "activity" seems to attract fans, comprised mostly of the idle, indolent and those who aspire to display a smugness of economic success, real or imagined. Yet, how can anyone criticize the sport today, when you got a gal like Wie proudly waving our red, white and blue? No, not today. No can. Maybe tomorrow. There's always tomorrow.&&&453
Wild dolphins can kill like any other animal - Ocean Watch&&&Although there are many exceptions, there are some general rules about the differences between dolphins and porpoises. Dolphins tend to have long, distinct snouts while porpoises thend to have heads that are a bit rounder. The dorsal fin on the top of the back of a dolphin is usually curved while those on porpoises tend to have a more triangular shape with a flat back. Tooth shape also varies with dolphins having cone-shaped teeth and porpoises having ones that are spade-shaped. Of course, if one is close enough to see the teeth, it is probably possible to determine the exact species being looked at.&&&1

Caregivers experience depression, isolation - Hawaii News&&&It is your responsibility to pass a Death with Dignity law to bring a peaceful, happy ending to ones life. Choice, no pain, no suffering, just peace. Many evil people oppose such a law because they are incapable of love and have no idea what love means. These evil people oppose the law and want you to suffer endlessly. Think about it, no compassionate person would want anyone to suffer and lose all their money and left with no dignity at end of life. The Republicans constantly defeat such a law, that tells you the true character of Republicans. Stop the evil and pass a Death with Dignity law.&&&15
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Cathy Smith from Mililani Mauka seems to think that the "Keep it Kailua crowd" is somehow the only ones who oppose these commercial operations in residential zones. Well Cathy Smith from Mililani Mauka, here are some of the others on the growing lists of entities that have thus far voiced opposition to allowing additional B&B hotels in residential zoning include: HONOLULU PLANNING COMMISSION (Unanimously), NEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS: Kuli’ou’ou/Kalani Iki Neighborhood Board No.2, Waialae/Kahala, Neighborhood Board No.3, Diamond Head/Kapahului St Louis Neighborhood Board No. 5, Waianae Neighborhood Board No. 24, North Shore Neighborhood Board No. 27, Koolauloa Neighborhood Board No. 28, Kailua Neighborhood Board No. 31, Waimanalo Neighborhood Board No.32, ORGANIZATIONS: ILWU Local 142, Unite Here Local 5 AFL-CIO Hawaii, League of Women Voters-Honolulu, The Institute for Human Services, Punalu’u Community Association, Waimanalo Beach Lots Association, Livable Hawaii Kai Hui, Save Oahu’s Neighborhoods Hawai’I, Lanikai Community Association, Lani-Kailua Outdoor Circle, Keep it Kailua, ELECTED OFFICIALS: Senator Carol Fukunaga, Senator Fred Hemmings, Senator Ken Ito, Representative Lyla Berg, Representative Chris Lee, Representative Michael Magaoay, Representative Cynthia Thielen, Representative Gene Ward. Please note Cathy Smith from Mililani Mauka that no Neighborhood Board and no community association have come out in support of the proposed legislation.&&&21

Bed and breakfasts: It's decision time - Hawaii Editorials&&&One argument seems based in fact with reason while the other seems to be based on conjecture and/or a crystal ball. If there truly have been few complaints about B&Bs in the past, we shouldn't expect a huge increase if this bill should pass. The requirements seem stringent and reasonable. Logically thinking, I wouldn't expect the visitor population to be any more unruly or undesirable than people who live in Hawaii in the first place. And frankly, it would be much better to have unruly neighbors that only stay for a few days than a permanently irritating neighbor who never goes away. Pass the bill.&&&38
Fate of flow to be decided - Hawaii Business&&&HC&S cries great big crocodile tears for their workers. Their real long term plan if they can keep the water is to turn the property into subdivisions.

And our precious state government is hellbent on aiding and abetting this crime that is in clear violation of the state water code.&&&4

Shame on us if students suffer - Hawaii Editorials&&&An audit would be interesting but unless the Legislature acts on the recommendations then nothing changes. That pattern has repeated itself over and over in recent times. Any audit should require written justification of every bureaucratic position within DOE. It shouldn't be enough to just assert that we need this person to do whatever. And they should look into all the 6 month contracts the DOE hands out to former teachers. I'm not trying to be critical of the former teachers but they are being hired to do the work of someone that is already a full time bureaucrat. And DOE is rife with this behavior.&&&9

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Two quick thoughts: * B&B's ruin the neighborhood. Any neighborhood. What can they possibly bring to the 'hood? So, the owners get extra income, probably evade taxes. Oahu streets are too congested now, w/o add'l cars. * On Maui, roads are closed for 8 hours while MPD are on their hands and knees looking for "evidence". After a crash, everyone misses all the Lahaina tours, trips and locals miss work. And going to Kahului, tourists miss their flights. It's a complete joke how the MPD approaches accidents.&&&25

War's attractions are cruel illusions - Hawaii Editorials&&&"I wanted to hear the general's case for continuing the war in Afghanistan and how he sold the idea of sending more troops to President Obama, whom I voted for believing he would lead us to be less warlike as a nation." Obama made clear his warmonger inner self throughout the campaign when he threatened Pakistan and overtly stated his preferences for waging war in Afghanistan, "the graveyard of empires." (source unknown) There were other people to work for, like Ralph Nader and the Peace and Freedom Party, the Greens, and more; so it is odd that anyone seriously committed to peace would have voted for the opportunist Obama.&&&17

Rather be Poor with all the friends I have ... wouldn't trade them for MONEY!!!!! No way! P.S. By the way, the RICH dies early and with hardly any friends???????? What goes around comes around.&&&18
Defense bill shifts war spending priorities - Hawaii News&&&US spends more on defense than the rest of the world COMBINED. The article/report on the waste of resources illuminates an obscenity. Karzi recently informed us that Afghanistan would not be able to pay for its own defense until 2024, so we will be paying the tab forever. The right wing must be happy to see how Obama has embraced the neocon tactics they instituted with Bush; they may rail at his domestic agenda, but his corporatist heart has been revealed for what it is. All those Obama supporters who swallowed his phony promises of change have to be having a rough time with his capitulation and emergence as Mr, Same Old Same Old.&&&6
Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"B&B bill would hurt hotels in Waikiki" More bunk from the anti B&B crowd. B&B's are used by budget minded folks, which is a small minority of visitors. The hotels will NOT lose business since the B&B's already exist and folks stay in them, legal or not. The best way to control them is regulate them...deal with it.&&&171

Hanabusa's dance card full - Hawaii News&&&Quote: "Hanabusa said she will keep in mind the best interest of the Senate first." What a sad, pathetic lie that is. Hanabusa will keep HER best interests in mind - first, foremost and without exception. Why is she even running for Abercrombie's seat? She does not live in the district!! Answer: because she figures she has a better chance there compared to running against Mazie Hirono in the Second Congressional District (the one she lives in). Colleen Hanabusa only cares about what is political expedient for herself. She doesn't care one bit about doing the right thing for her constituents or the general public. Second case in point: her opposition to the Waimanalo Gulch landfill. Let's face reality - Oahu needs a place to put its garbage. But Colleen doesn't want it close to where she lives. So she tries to shut down something EVERYONE needs to serve her own benefit. I would call that putting her best interest in front of the entire island. Is this the kind of person we want to keep electing to public office? Let's also not forget her misguided defense of the corrupt Bishop Estate trustees who were looting the school for their own personal gain. Colleen Hanabusa is the poster girl for all that is wrong in Hawaii's politics and government.&&&13

Frustration and anger fuel parents' open plea to leaders - Hawa...&&&The worst action for education in this furlough fiasco is to get students back into the classroom. When that day comes the discussion of education will come to a halt. Hopefully furlough Fridays will be the beginning of something meaningful for public school--rather than how Hawaii appears to the rest of the world. The facilities of our schools, the curriculum of our schools, the calendar of our schools, and most importantly the diplomas of our schools are obsolete. Furlough Fridays are indicative of a much larger crisis than day care.&&&26

Federal quota could halt bigeye catch this month - Hawaii News&&&The last week of December would affect the annual New years Day local parties were sashimi is served. Either that or it will not be as fresh as possisble. These lomg liners are responsible for the depletion of other edible popular fishes and should be controlled more. With a 150 boats setting miles and miles of line they catch everything out there.They practive indescrimatory fishing. Sharks are definned and thrown back, juvenile swordfish are killed before they can reproduce. They catch all species of fish and even have been blamed for entangling whales with their miles and miles of line. There are some regulations in place but they have been known to break the rules and fish areas that are closed. The Coast Guard keeps track of them but cannot be in every place. More regulation is needed before we run out of species like the bigeye tuna. Lots of these fishing boats were chased out of the Gulf for overfishing and many infraction of laws there. They are here now and have been here for years, and we are finding out that they practice the raping of the ocean for profit.&&&19
Man accused in shooting described as caring - Hawaii News&&&Hawaii needs a "Death With Dignity" law. What's keeping it from being passed are the hospitals, nursing home, and such mainly because it's a money thing for them, not caring for the terminally ill. My mother was a good example. Placed in a long term care facility, my mother weighed 170 when she went in. A year later, she was down to 75 pounds, couldn't speak, didn't recognize anyone, and spent her days crying and moaning. When she could no longer swallow her food, they wanted to place a feeding tube down her throat. My mother had several years back filed an Advanced Health Care Directive, which directed that if she was incapacited, I would make the health decisions. I declined the tube feeding offer and informed the facility to just keep her comfortable and pain free. When she first went into long term care, I had to write a check for $24,000 dollars to even get her in. How many people today with the economic situation as it stands can just flip open their checkbook and write a $24,000 dollar check. We need Death With Dignity legislation.&&&54

Socialism in Hawaii, increased taxes to feed the fat and useless union hack working stiffs and their lawyers, can be blamed on the dying breed of Yoshinagas throughout Hawaii.&&&96

Better 'homeless' policy needed - Hawaii Editorials&&&Reference what I said a few days ago. Probably a good amount of the people coming to hawaii to live are looking for the free good life and then find out, you actually have to work to afford living there. Since hawaii is unique in livable land space, maybe people coming with a one way ticket, MUST BE ABLE TO SHOW AND PROVE THEY HAVE THE MEANS TO LIVE THERE...or...they will be turned around at the airport and sent back to where they came from. TO MAKE MY POINT. We came in Feb l990 with a confirmed hotel. At the breakfast briefing it was stated every hotel room in the hawaiian islands was sold out and people arriving WITHOUT CONFIRMED ROOMS were being sent back where they came from. Someone had the courage to do the right thing.&&&61

Taiwanese city backs actors in quiet film - Hawaii Features&&&The review fails to mention why it only gives the film 2 1/2 stars.

There are other better Chinese films out there.&&&1

Home sales on Big Island and Kauai up in November - Hawaii Busi...&&&Housing Crash Continues It's Still A Terrible Time To Buy Because it's a terrible time to buy when interest rates are low, like now. Realtors just lie without shame about this fundamental fact. House prices fall as interest rates rise, because a fixed monthly payment covers a smaller mortgage at a higher interest rate. Since interest rates have nowhere to go but up, prices have nowhere to go but down. The way to win the game is to have cash on hand to buy outright at a low price when others cannot borrow very much because of high interest rates. To buy at a time of low interest rates and high prices like now is a mistake.&&&2

We always hear about the payout for BCS, but not about all the WAC tournaments in general. If 2008 WAC VB made money, shouldn't we have the WAC VB in Hawaii, why give money to a neutral site. How did the previous baseball and softball WAC tournaments do in Hawaii. We know football and volleyball made money, will find out the specifics later.&&&9
In This City Is There No One Willing To Listen And Support?&&&Topic: In This City Of About 800,000 People Is There No One Willing To Support China's Emperor And Head Of State In Exile? This is a serious posting. Officially by China's history and Han-Chinese succession, I am China's current succession emperor. In 1990, I negotiated a permanent end to the Iraq War between President George H.W. Bush and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. I am, also, Hebrew (paternal Hebrew) coming from the Chou/Zhou/Jo Dynasty of China. I am 61 years old. I have no money and no direct support from family members, unfortunately. My mission in life is to return to China (a) to insure that China will always have good government and (b) to return the true worship of God to China's 1.3 billion people. Is this a good mission? Since I was the 1990-91 negotiator for the Iraq War, I am in the best position to end this conflict. I am able to do a better job than our own government and the Obama administration. I wish that I had money and the support and love of the American people for these tasks. If I started a church and no one in Hawaii came. If I tried to rally Hawaii's people for the cause of freedom in China and no one joined this movement. If I tried to gather my family (clan and kinfolks) and no one paid any attention and did not wish to return to China, should I give up?&&&3
Christmas gives us a reminder to share - Hawaii Editorials&&&It is an escape from reality for a few weeks.

Please stop the madness!Then you will trully be acknowledging the truth of Jesus birth, the Peacemaker.&&&2

Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&This study to lay tansmission cables between Maui,Lanai,Molokai, and Oahu will get the attention of tree huggers for sure. 400 megawatts of renewable energy from wind farms would offset the use of oil burned to generate electricity.

Michigan is probably sky high after their victory over Stanford and will be very dangerous. Each young lady on the team should be proud of their accomplishments. The improvement from last year is startling! Also, great coaching has helped. Lets see you win and all expenses trip to Florida.. Go Bows!!&&&23
Pedestrians in peril - Hawaii Editorials&&&At signaled intersections, pedestrians should never have to share the intersection with vehicular traffic. An all stop for vehicular traffic should be made while a crosswalk signal is illuminated. Then vehicular traffic could resume. Quite a few pedestrain/vehicular accidents occur because of the "right turn on red after stop." This law in reality doesn't save an time for a vehicle operator, so do away with it. King Street is especially worrisome due to the number of lanes. When a person steps out into the roadway, although the closest lane comes to a stop, the second lane may think that person is turning and fails to stop before the pedestrain in front of that left lane vehicle steps into the second lanes path.&&&67

Theft of donated checks not going to stop donor - Hawaii News&&&AUW helps poor people. Stealing from poor people is not happening. Give 'em back. AUW should not have had all those checks or cash in their office. Should have been accounted for, then immediately deposited into their bank account, at the close of EACH day. Hope AUW learned a lesson here. Didn't this happen before? I suspect the theives know we all looking for them, so they may have put the checks in a big paper bag, and spouted lighter fluid on it, and set it ablaze.&&&17

It almost felt like they could catch up to the wheelchair competitors (Awesome athletes in their own right) and maybe even pass them!&&&1
Lottery brought Georgia more cash for education - On Politics&&&Really, Richard? Can this be read as anything other than a cheap attempt to convince one of the gubernatorial candidates to support legalized gambling? And please explain how gambling income would not be "fungible"? That is, how can you argue the money would not either be used for other functions OR would not cause money currently used for education to be transfered for other, urgent needs? If the lottery does not raise enough money to fund the schools, General Funds will still go to education. If the lottery would generate LOTS of funds, while people "are starving in the streets," our leaders will RIGHTLY tap into those funds. The "dedicated to education" rationale is tempting, but it is a fraud. Please stop repeating it uncritically.&&&1

I would like to see her win again and finally put to rest those naysayers that come up with statistic since whe was 13 years old. Think about it at 13 most were still wiping there noses on their shirts. You have to laugh at some commenters who use racist remarks against a young ladies career just to be mean. They act like jealous 13 year old kids themselves. Plague with injuries if she stay healthy and keeps in school she most certainly has a very bright future.&&&3

Mercado kicks Kahuku to win - Hawaii Sports&&&It was all good sportsmanship and clean hard fought battle between two titans of the OIA. Not many colleges can have a kicker to boast about but Kahuku was most fortunate to have a kicker like Cameron. He took it upon his shoulders not to let the team down when they counted on him the most. Strong winds didn't let him kick the ball into the endzone on kickoffs, so it shows how badly he wanted to make those fieldgoals in the cross winds and the rain. Defensively Kahuku bended but didn't break. Imua Red Raiders and hats off to the Govs too.&&&31

The People of Hawaii do not deserve better, having given up on voting, caved into Demohack pressure, in a sniveling, get along, go along, union working stiff allegiance that could best describe a third world banana republic.&&&14
Attorneys trying to hurry furlough case for disabled - Hawaii News&&&Not being cold or heartless but THIS IS RIDICULOUS! IT just sounds to me that the parents cannot bear or tolerate being with their special needs child and want them in the schools so they can take time out from their child. The furlough days play no significant role in the child's development. It would benefit the child MORE if the parent spent time with their child on the furlough day in connecting with their child in his/her educational development instead of having the schools be a day care so they can get respite from caring or being a parent to their child. These attorneys MAKE ME SICK.&&&70

But seriously, how stupid can these knuckleheads be to think that it is OK to smoke pakalolo where there are like over 2,000 cops and fire fighters nearby?

Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&Why does the Bulletin bury the news that tax revenues continue to fall? The public -- including the unions -- need to come to grips that our tax revenues are way down and there's no money to fund raises, prevent layoffs or subsidize child care. State taxes drop 6.5% in 5 months of fiscal year The state says tax revenues for the first five months of this fiscal year are 6.5 percent below revenues recorded for the same period the previous fiscal year. The state Department of Taxation said yesterday that revenue from general excise and use taxes, the largest category, decreased 7.3 percent during the five months beginning in July. Transient accommodations tax, or hotel room tax, revenues are down 5.6 percent. Individual income tax revenues are down 9.1 percent, while corporate income tax revenues are down 38.5 percent.&&&1

Amis likely to redshirt due to foot injury - Sports News&&&I feel for Coach Nash & the team that Bill Amis seems out for the season. I honestly think they'd be at least 6-2 if he had been available. I'm happy for next year's team when he returns as they'll need his leadership & contributions on the court as they'll be losing a lot of seniors. I like the recruits & the guys (already on the team but sitting out this year) we've already got. The only huge losses will be replacing Roderick Flemings; talented guys like him aren't available to us all that often. Hope Coach has a lead on some power forwards.&&&1

Sadly too is that every newspaper will print the wrong name of the place where she died. What ever the reason the name was changed 50 or so years ago. The change is wrong. The change is just one letter. Yet one letter can make a big difference. Heck it wasn't even totally changed. What happened is one letter was removed from the name. The first letter. It is a "W". Story is a sign was damaged to the point where the "W" broke or fell off the sign. Well way back then folks knew it's true name. As they moved on and the sign remained unfixed the name changed. The change has become standard and is now in print for books and on official maps. All of it is wrong. Older official maps prove it. Put the "W" back. Respect WANINI..........&&&3

Stanford regional stacked - Hawaii Sports&&&Hawaii is the only team in this regional to play on the road for a second consecutive week. The other three all hosted the first two rounds. The NCAA crapped on this coach, these girls, their fans, the entire program, and the people of Hawaii. It is obvious they allowed influences to decide who goes where and why. In this day and age one can only wonder who got paid, and why. All involved should hang their heads in shame. Ignoring the low life antics of the NCAA and their corrupt style, these girls deserve all the praise for making it this far. The NCAA obviously has tried every tactic to make them gone. Keep winning girls. With each win you prove the stuffy criminals wrong. Something they obviously dislike. Good luck!&&&3
Wisconsin gives Hawaii 1 more embarrassing loss - Hawaii Sports&&&Injuries added to a lack of depth and that killed UH this year. The one point UNLV loss was the biggest negative.

Shooting at nothing, kicking in doors of huts. Bin Laden is long gone. Afghanistan has 165 "tribes", whatever that means. You think the USA can "stabilize" a government there? HA!

Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&"Child Care Plan Delayed to Feb. 1: The department said yesterday that to ease the transition, it is working with licensed child-care providers to obtain federal assistance that offers support for child care, rent and other necessities." Does this mean that there is federal assistance available that has not been taken advantage of? WHY NOT?? Whose responsibility is it to research available assistance and why have they not been doing their job and is there any consequence for them not doing their job competently?&&&1
No general H1N1 vaccination yet - Hawaii News&&&I'm so sick of this! My wife is pregnant and has been trying for two months to get this shot! We also have friends with a 5 month old are in the same position. What gives? We know people who are not even in the high risk group who have been able to get it. Every time she calls her Dr. at Kaiser(which is nearly every day), they tell her they either don't have it or just ran out. She also can't find any at the grocery store pharmacies, which seem to have more of it than the dr. offices. Would Mark Bennet at least look into this quagmire? I have a feeling there's something going on here that Dr. Park and the DOH don't want us to know. That, or they have no idea how to run an program.&&&3

'Homealani' honors a life well-lived - Features Stories&&&Anne Marie brings honor and pride to this docu-film regarding her grandfather Oliver Kupau and what he stood for not only among his family, but fellow co-workers, infantrymen,as well as his Hawaiian heritage or background. I'm sure her grandfather was peering over her shoulder, breathing down her back, inspiring her to continue what I think he would've done were he alive today to tell his story or stories, his memories of yesteryear, a bit of Hawaiian history, tidbits or snapshots of his life. I am excited to see this presentation of this man, this Hawaiian family man and his history as seen, as heard, as inspired, as memoralized through the eyes of his granddaugher, Anne Marie,his family, as she turns the pages, takes us through those passages of time with pride, happiness, laughter and some tears. What more can you ask for, what great homage to your grandfather, what an honor to place before him and to all. Anne Marie might have just started something here for all those out there interested in taking those steps toward family history. May God Bless her, and her grandpa, her family.Let the honor begin..........&&&1

'Bows rally to top 'Swords - Sports News&&&Unless the coaching staff can motivate the players to play the whole game, the WAC prediction of Hawaii finishing in last place is very possible. After watching them play a few games, I believe the problem is with the coaching or lack thereof. While other coaches are on their feet pacing the sideline and shouting instructions or encouragement to players, the entire coaching staff is QUIET. I don't see emotion or motivation from the coaches and this is translated to play on the court. This team plays without emotion. Fleming is not comfortable with his role as a leader. What I saw last night was a team without confidence or swagger and if they don't get it together, it's going to be a downward spiral. I gave Nash a chance to prove his ability to coach but with each passing game, I'm realizing he's not ready for prime time as a head coach. I hope he proves me wrong.&&&3

First Wind offers plan for second Maui site - Hawaii Business&&&The Ugly Truth About the " New Safer Prop Wind Turbines" - A must See Video...When it comes to industrial wind energy full disclosure has been a major problem. All across North America the wind industry has had a field day dealing with the ignorance of community planners. Each community should do their homework. Why would anyone want to buy a car that gets 5 mpg and then have to drive it 25 years. That is what a lease with the archaic prop wind turbine is all about. Each community needs to invest in the new wind turbine designs. You will receive far more electricity with the new designs and in the process not slaughter protected birds. I am an expert on Birds of Prey. For all the green energy believers out there, there is a video you have to see. Please check out the YOUTUBE video - fatal accident with a vulture on a windmill, to see an eyewitness account of what is happening to millions of birds across the world each year. Most of the dead are protected species and many are rare or endangered. The prop turbine seen in this video is not even spinning at full speed. It is spinning at just 12 rotations per minute. At full speed it will spin at 20 rotations per minute making this wind turbine even more dangerous to anything that happens to fly by. Each year across America thousands of eagles, hawks, owls, falcons, vultures and condors perish at green energy wind farms. This video will open your eyes and your mind when you see how easily a soaring vulture is smashed by the innocent looking blades of a prop wind turbine. Most prop wind turbines have blade tips speeds of approximately 200 mph. This video illustrates why all birds and bats do not have a chance near the spinning blades of a prop turbine. There has been a wind industry cover-up about the bird mortality problem for decades. Most wind farms have very high security so images like this can not be seen. Today in America there are approx 30,000 prop turbines. If the prop turbine industry has their way there will over 300,000 of these mass killers in the US in years to come. We are facing the extinction of many species of birds across the world. The first to go will probably be the Red Kite in Italy. They have almost disappeared because of collisions with prop wind turbines. Do plenty of research before signing a 20-30 year lease with the prop turbine peddlers that will end up being be a death sentence for the birds in your community. The public is not aware that there are alternative wind turbine designs available that do not slaughter our precious wildlife and also produce much more energy. One of them is produced by Environmental Technologies LLC. If the corrupt entities of Wall Street, Washington, and our courts were not protecting this industry, this terrible problem would have already been resolved. It is time that the world started paying attention to the future planned for us by the titans of industry. Prop turbines are all about functional obsolescence, planned obsolescence, and most of all greed. The outdated technology of the prop wind turbine needs to be exposed for the fraud it represents to the green energy movement. fatal accident with vulture on a windmill&&&6

'Pau Hana Patrol' will track down happy hour deals - Hawaii Fea...&&&Sorry, but champagne and Chambord is not a Kir Royale. A Kir Royale is champagne and creme de cassis. Using Chambord in place of the creme de cassis makes a cocktail called a Kir Imperial. Either the writer got it wrong, or Du Vin got it wrong. If it's the writer, I suppose it's an easy mistake. However, if Du Vin is selling a Kir Imperial as a Kir Royale, they're contributing to the bastardization of cocktail practice that always happens when something gets popular. Changing the recipe of something because that's what's popular is idiotic, when it changes the whole drink. For crying out loud, there's a name for champagne and Chambord, so call it a Kir Imperial, not a Kir Royale! Look at the martini. It's supposed to be gin, people, not vodka. So don't ask me what I want in my martini if I say, "I'd like a martini, please." Also, half the bartenders don't even put vermouth in the shaker anymore, especially at night clubs where the young hipsters don't even notice the difference, or think it makes their martini (probably vodka) "taste funny." It's a MARTINI, people, it's SUPPOSED to taste like that! You just want cold vodka with an olive, then order that and stop ruining the good name of the martini! Man, I need a drink!:)&&&2

The empty suit stacked this "task force" so that it looked like it was impartial, but mufi had placed his votes with shills to begin with, to arrive at the result mufi wanted. This is the kind of crooked politics this crook now pretending to serve as mayor, is all about. But, mufi KNOWS he is in for another costly fight.

Teacher standards board slammed - Hawaii News&&&The HTSB was lobbied for under false pretenses. It was to get more pay for teachers by making the profession appear more professional by a creation of a licensing board. It is also interesting to note that the former Executive Director of the HSTB and I believe an original member of the HTSB appointed by than Governor Cayatano, was also President of HSTA which was the first Union to endorse Gubernatorial Candidate Cayatano. All things as they are and were it is no surprise that the HSTB is in such as mess. The less fortunate situation is that the teachers are all suffering. It is about time HSTA asks for a repeal of the HTSB.$500,000 a year out of teachers pay going into a Board that does not support the teachers and chastises teachers for not doing things on time when the teachers have trouble getting in contact with someone from the HTSB office for support. And let’s not forget that they wanted HSTA to lobby the legislature for funds for an office staff. So where is the money going?&&&1

Rail transit: Elevated train promises Honolulu a better future&&&Great! We, will build a railroad that costs a lot of money and can potentially have a negative impact on the environment. Our schools have furlough fridays, our schools have cut back on budget, our schools have had employees laid off or retired early. Does it really seem that it is the right time to build a Rail transit when we are in a bad economical-state? Better future? Ridiculous. If the government wants a better future, why don't you look at the students who ARE going to be the future working citizens? The government decides the slowly diminish our education and spend money on a rail transit? Education has priority over a rail transit in my personal opinion. Another wise decision by our prudent government. And if you think a rail transit that covers only a limited area (even if we have busses and trollies) should take priority over education, then by all means, present your case to me and we shall debate. I'm fourteen years old and I see first hand how public schools struggle to keep up financially. I only can hope that our government will soon make more sage decisions.&&&15

Rainbow Wahine get smacked around in Laie - Hawaii Sports&&&Why do you think Kuehu got hurt? I think god is punishiong her for all her transgressions, lying, cheating, using people. I bet many naive people will feel sorry for her. But the people in the know, do not feel sorry for her. Kuehu is foul! There is no other way to say it. In an earlier story, the paper said Kuehu is wearing #20 to honor her mentor, Nani Cockett. Why? What did she do? If I had a daughter, Nani is the last person I would want to mentor or be around my daughter. Cockett has a track record of getting girls to come into her circle, ones with low self-esteem and claim them as her own after they are polished products. Where was she when Kuehu was 8? I will tell you, probably with some girl. The gentleman who trained Kuehu and made her what she is today (basketball wise) is Coach Dennis Agena. He spent hundreds or thousands of hours teaching her how to play the game right. But, since Kuehu has been poisoned by her parents and now Nani, she shares credit with Nani who has done absolutely nothing but take her to night clubs and expose her to a new lifestyle. I wonder if the Local Newspapers will report that. If Kuehu had any integrity (she doesn't, by the way), she would have thanked Coach Agena for getting her to college. But, due to parental influence, Nani's influence, and a lack of morals, character traits, and integrity, she thanks the wrong person. She is a foul person today.&&&4

Is there improvement on the horizon for UH? - Hawaii Sports&&&I agree the lopsided loss does not bode well for the coming season. What the game proved is the importance of a good offensive line. Unfortunately the Warriors lose 4/5 of a not so good offensive line. As for a quarterback after this loss I'm not convinced that Moniz is the Warriors answer. Perhaps the the main reason I have doubts for improvement is the one stable part of the Warriors, everyone returns....its the coaching staff. I just hope I'm proven wrong.&&&24

If that's what she said then she's flat lying or else she's is truly unaware that the Hawaii School System has continually failed in its duty to provide a quality education. More than likely she's heard that Hawaii panders to people such as this with mucho benefits, all paid for by Hawaii taxpayers.&&&22
Chinatown vendors battle rat infestation - Hawaii News&&&More budget cuts affect the poor. I shop at Safeway and Whole Foods. I am sure that they also have problems with pests and vermin...but patrons don't go to those stores if they are unclean or suspected of having vermin. Poor, elderly, and people seeking deals go to chinatown. I have fresh fish but I get it from Foodland. Elderly cannot afford the comforts of Foodland so they eat second and third rated quality food. The quality of food in Chinatown are all seconds, flawed or unsaleable to the average customer. I don't go to Chinatown because there are no deals there. Cut coupons, stick with Longs, Safeway and the open outdoor markets. The help in those little shops are not trained to HACCP standards. Refrigeration is poor and people handle the food with bare unwashed hands. Ask Lingle when she bought bannana's, chicken, pork or fish in Chinatown. She would laugh at you. The State must contain the problem to that area.&&&187

If you take a look at , you'll see that even the big/designer stores are doing things to encourage shopping with gift guides, free shipping promos, and 20-25% off entire purchases. Cross-store promotions are also found on places like Facebook. Take a look at . The A&F/HCo./Gilly Hicks promotion was found on the fan pages. If anyone needs any help looking for Holiday deals, be sure to bookmark and feel free to ask me anything on Twitter. I'm @VivatSALE.&&&3

MOST of the online comments I have read follow this exact pattern as well.

Enjoy Chart House's margaritas - Hawaii Features&&&I've been eating, drinking and enjoying the great food and friendly service at Chart House for over 20 years. It has been my pick as the "must go" restaurant for anyone that visits our islands. You can't beat the gorgeous sunsets, live music and extensive pupu menu. It was unfortunate that the above reviewer didn't receive a greeting when they walked in the door because we are always greeted by name with a warm smile and kiss on the cheek. Many of our friends have said that The Chart House was the best place they've been on their trip. We loyal, local patrons know they must be doing something very right at The Chart House for still being around after more than 40 years. CHEERS!&&&5
Group asks Hannemann to help homeless people - Hawaii News&&&The mayor is working on it, he is building a rail system which between the stations and the rail cars can house thousands. Sorry to say but there is not a lot the government can do beyond what is already there. The down side to the current shelter system is you have to follow the rules..and many don't want to. The cheapest solution, charter aircraft to get those homeless who do want to work and buy a house to a market with jobs..where ever that might be these days. Those who just want to leech off the system well...tough love I guess.&&&136

Unfortunately, I am a life long Democrat but the politics and bedfellows or partners in this morass are the Democrats and Unions who have consistently played politics with the Governor ultimately resulting in the mess we have now. Hanabusa is one of the worse and I don't want to waste space by naming the other Democrat idiots all who are running for office next year and unfortunately, its the public who loses by constantly and continually to reelect these pollitics who play politics with the people. YOU GET WHAT YOU VOTE FOR!!!THINK ABOUT IT!!

Waikiki curbside campers must go - Hawaii News&&&Hannemann said the campers are a state government concern, too. "We can clean up and maintain the park and enforce the rules. But we don't have a social services department, a housing department, an education department ... to address the many needs the homeless have. It cannot be solely on the shoulders of the city." Well.. since he is going to run for governor i tehn have to believe he is going to SOLVE the problem as teh leader of the state. errrrr.. stupid me. what was i thinking. tehn it will be a city problem. Want more FAMILIES as tourists ? Eradicate teh whores and PIMPS that are kidnapping tourists... that might be a good starting point. what about the 20 or so PIMPS in waikiki.."mo money.. mo money" the ones that are kidnapping Japanese tourists and our kids, making them sex slaves and shipping them off to other parts of the country ? " The indictment returned on May 20 charges Rodney King with sex-trafficking, attempted sex-trafficking, sex-trafficking of a minor and conspiracy. The minor females were 16 when they worked as prostitutes for King. " Hawaii has one of the largest problems of human trafficking in the country. According to the Honolulu Police Department, in 2008, Honolulu (not statewide) saw 15 children as High Risk Victims for Human Trafficking PER MONTH (or one child every other day). Hawaii is one of eight remaining states in America that has not passed a Human Trafficking State Law or laws effectively addressing Human Trafficking as a felony offense while protecting the victims.&&&67
Changes would keep child care subsidies - Guest Editorials&&&Everyone in the program will still continue to get a child care subsidy but the amount they will have to pay is on a sliding scale based on their income level and the number of people in their family.

Is there improvement on the horizon for UH? - Further Review&&&We lost at least one (more probably 2) games because of the lack of a Div.1a quality kicker. If we win one more game, we're in the Sheraton Hawai'i Bowl and all is forgiven & forgotten. Had a chance to see Cameron Mercado (kicker at Kahuku High) and he is as good as billed & I hope UH offers him a scholie because Enos was just plain inconsistent this year; check that..awful was more accurate. Yes they were totally outclassed against Wisconsin & I thought they'd be more competitive. What was with recognizing Seniors BEFORE the game?? How STUPID is that to bring out watm fuzzy feelings & nostalgia right BEFORE a game when you should be AMPED UP at the "enemy". I thought that Jim Donovan & the Stadium Authority should share the blame for short-circuiting the emotional pitch of the team. That's sabotage plain, DUMB and unthinking on their part. If Coach Mack didn't realize that then the onus is on him too! If they get Mercado, the team improves automatically. Moniz had a brain fart in the last game but I don't see why he shouldn't continue to pick up where he left off from the Navy game. Also Moniz looked so bad due to the INEPTNESS, INCOMPETENCE & lack of SPIRIT by by Aaron Kia who was worse than AWFUL & I was surprised by Coach Mack who played him pretty much to the end. He couldn't put up any semblance of protection, collapsing the pocket time Nd time again and at other times when the opponent didn't rush in, they made tackles on the RB regularly with Kia unable to do anything but stand around and watch. He was only slightly more effective than the Florida State lineman who fell asleep in stance while all other 21 players were in motion.&&&6

Salas, Estes, Soares are All-WAC - Sports News&&&Blaze and Estes can play. Blaze will be a good fit on the strong side in the 4-3, but I don't know if he can play in space. The guy hits like truck and seems to have the quicks. Avoided injuty this year which is huge. Estes, not the power center, but could fit in with a team that operates a lot in the shotgun like the Patriots. I think he is a pure center, not bulky enough for a guard. Good technique and if you watch him he has great balance, is rarely knocked off his feet, and uses his hands well. Kia - free agent tryout, but will get a shot. Tough guy though who needs to move inside to guard.&&&1

Just for laughs - Hawaii Features&&&Unlike most stories about retirees and retirement lately, this one is both inspirational and positive. There was a time when the word “retirement” was joyfully expressed and thought by the majority to be a special phase of a person’s life. Retirement has been getting a bad name lately, however, particularly by people who don’t have a clue about how to enjoy themselves with all the free time. Hopefully this story will help more individuals join the group of retirees who are truly satisfied and happy to be retired. Regarding Yona Chock's comment "We may be living in paradise, but it gets boring," today I will take your boring Paradise with glee, given that it is extremely cold here in Edmonton where I live. The temperature right now is -15 degrees F but with the wind chill it feels like -30 degrees F. I am not sure that my car will start due to the cold. In fact, my goal is to get to Hawaii for the winter for 2 months every winter so that I can enjoy your boring Paradise. Ernie J.

Does anyone know of a good site that might have lots of pictures that I could look through in hopes of finding a picture of my father? I don't know if this really is the proper place to request something like this, but I am hopeful that someone can help.&&&1

Warrior Replay - Hawaii Sports&&&Dave you must be kidding. If you think those 5 plays were the difference in the game you didn't watch the game.Unfortunately that offensive line was just to big and talented. Its not about what the Warriors didn't do, they tried to match up but they were just out manned. If you watched the Fresno game the same thing happened. We just dont have the horses to stop a good running game. This years team reminded me a lot of the Von Oppen teams in terms of team preperation. Coach Mac might be a nice guy but we will never have a good team with him as the head coach. He cant recruit and his coaches are lousy. Just look at the recruits that have committed to Hawaii for next year, not a single recruit is rated above 70, most are rated in the lower 40% of the recruit base.

Jehovah's Witness convention to generate $100M in spending&&&Get to Know more about them WHO ARE JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES? The central CORE doctrine of the Watchtower,the reason they came into existence was to proclaim Jesus Christ second coming in 1914.They will now deny that they ever made this claim,that's called BAIT AND SWITCH The Watchtower is BIG money, being one of the top 40 New York City Corporations making nearly one billion dollars a year.Thats just from one of their many corporations.They pay no municipal taxes on their buildings,without even one charity to compensate the community. Most Church's don't pay taxes either,but most mainstream churches are abundant in humanitarian charities.Think if you have ever seen a Jehovah Witness food pantry or soup kitchen for the needy? For 50 plus years the masthead of the Watchtower,viewed when you opened up to the inside front cover would read as follows: "This magazine(Watchtower) builds up confidence in the Creators PROMISE of a peaceful and secure "new world" before the generation "that witnessed" the EVENTS OF 1914 passes away"". By their own admission the Watchtowers has published this dogma in hundreds of millions of pieces of their own literature. They deleted this false adventist millerite derived prophecy in 1995 because it had FAILED. The Watchtower leadership has "purged" hundreds of thousands of followers over the years for failing to uphold the 1914 (Jesus came to power) loyalty oath to this now defunct dogma. The Bible clearly warns to turn away from false prophets. -------- Jehovah's Witnesses and "persecution". UNLIKE in the case of Christians who are persecuted in other lands for talking about Jesus Christ, Jehovahs Witnesses are largely persecuted for following the teachings begun during the second presidency of the Watchtower, when Joseph F. Rutherford took over in a corporate flap and began changing doctrines quickly in the Watchtower belief system. He claimed that angels directly conveyed truth to some of those in leadership. He coined the name Jehovahs Witnesses to make them stand out from being witnesses of Jesus, a typical evangelical expression (and a Biblical one). Rutherford dumped holidays, birthdays and the 1874 date for the invisible return on Christ, and INVENTED an earthly class of Witnesses, since only 144,000 can go to heaven in their teaching. The rest, meaning all 99.9% of Witnesses still alive, will live forever on a cleansed earth, under the rule of the Watchtower leaders in heaven, who will keep them in line by local elders known as Princes. If you have been witnessed to by Jehovahs Witnesses and you reject their message, you will likely die shortly at Armageddon with all the other non-Witnesses, since theirs is the ONLY TRUE religion, and (if they can live up to all the rules) they are the only ones to inhabit this new earth. To even vocally question the teachings of the Watchtower will result in complete cutting off, with family and friends usually being forbidden to talk to them. The Watchtower is a truly Orwellian world, in a time when Orwellian societies are nearly obsolete. Witnesses are shrinking in number in many Western countries,as the INTERNET facilitates the spread of information,much of it critical of the Witnesses. The Watchtower strives hard to control the flow of information to the individual Witness, and prefers that all instruction come through the magazines they carry door-to-door. Without this form of control, even as they themselves admit, they would believe just the same as other Bible believers. ---------- Danny Haszard Jehovah's Witness for 33 years and 3rd generation.

While I knew who she was, I felt it was important to respect her privacy and let her be herself and have a day off. Good journalism needs to be the priority over who is reporting.

natatorium&&&The money was raised for the Natatorium by the contributions of a nickel, penny or a dime by isle school children. Some had watched in the first few days of the war as the Hizen a Japanese cruiser sank the Aolus a German gunboat just outside the 3-mile limit off Waikiki. There was a concentration camp for Germans on Maui. German was no longer taught. All teachers with German-sounding names were asked to take a loyalty oath, then fired. Prof. Heuer at the Manoa campus was fired. A Catholic priest by name of Franz Feinler, although he was an Army chaplain, was sentenced to a long term at hard labor because he couldn't confirm the German troops had commited atrocities in Belgium (he had been stationed in France). Queen Lili'uokalani [died: Nov. 11, 1917], but before she did so, her court ladies sewed a gigantic Red Cross flag which was put on display at Iolani palace. She sent her aloha to the Queen of the Belgians. The recruitment camp was named after her. Based on Psalm 46, Martin Luther wrote "A Mighty Fortress is our God." Those persecuted and martyred for their convictions during the Reformation sang these words. But the Lutheran Church at 1730 Punahou Street was forbidden to sing them in German (the church was founded in 1900 by immigrants). Born in Waikiki Paoa Kahanamoku was known as Duke because that was what his father had been rechristened after the Duke of Edinburg visited Hawaii in 1869. Olympics gold-medalist "Duke" Kahanamoku swam the inaugural lap in the Natatorium pool when it opened Aug. 24, 1927 and fellow Olympians Buster Crabbe and Johnny Weismuller joined him. The structure should be revamped for the opening ceremony of APEC by November 2011. Honolulu's mayor dancing in a kimono on the Surrender Deck of the USS Missouri? What could be better than a tribute to Henrich Wilhelm Berger who retired in 1915 and died in 1929. He was the royal bandmaster. He composed and arranged 275 Hawaiian songs. He wrote music to the lyrics of King Kalakaua's 'Hawaii Ponoi,' and the first finished manuscript of 'Aloha Oe' for the Queen. He also served as organist at Kawaiahao Church for 15 years.&&&1

Two groups find faults in immigrant detentions&&&The United States of America may be considered as the "Land of Milk and Honey" by many foreigners, but they should also realize that it is a land with special laws and rules that apply to them.

And illegal aliens should run as fast as they can for the border...and should expect to be detained and processed if caught first. Our government needs to enforce the laws as they are and not be so quick to change them. Put the politics aside and portect our country.&&&3

National health reform bills would exempt Hawaii - Hawaii News&&&I don't think the writer understands something very important. States CAN opt out. Simple. But when one (US Government) is on a quest for unbridled power, they are not, I repeat NOT, going to let us opt out for long. They will simply begin the process of making sure Federal Funds become "harder" to find for Alohaland. They will do us through their (oops, I mean our so called representatives, God forbid Mazie remain in office, she'll sell us off in no time), and as long as we are opting out,(sounds good, right), Fed funds will mysteriously get harder to find their way here. One has to be brain dead to actually believe Hawaii will remain as is, ie healthcare, with Obamacare, Pelosicare, or Reidcare, finds its way to law.&&&38
Features | /2008/02/08/&&&As recent visitor to New Zealand, I was impressed by the Maori peoples spiritual connection through their genealogy and protocol when visiting a Marae. The challenge,gifting, singing, and acceptance by the chief was inspirational and I hope the best for the indigenous Maori, because a lot of damage was done to them by the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. Keep fighting for your rights.&&&2

Inside the Situation Room: How a war plan evolved - New York Times&&&This one has the smell of Viet Nam, the big Iraq invasion weapons of mass distruction lie, an untrustworthy CIA, and a script writers dream for a WWIII movie. Keep you kids home from this war. Serves no purpose. This is not about the American dream. The big international corporations rule and the outcome is predictable. I don't care about political opinions or the number of hours spent chasing this phantom. Nobody ever wins in Afganistan. I am just over 60 years old and I will not see the end of this in my lifetime. A reasonable expectation for my natural life is about 10 to 15 years. You do the math.&&&1

Beach ownership is still in question - Hawaii News&&&What this most clearly elucidates is how lacking in foresight were the rules that allowed individuals to "own" the beachfront. Would have been far wiser to have deemed all the beachfront lands as public property and so to have avoided the present day bounty that the rich enjoy as the wage slaves enjoy less and less access to beaches. What with all the private gates, the illegally nurtured vegetation, shorefront armoring, and other types of landgrabbing, the beaches are steadily becoming the property of the wealthy, whose greed is unlimited.&&&84
Hawaii Prep kicks out Moanalua - Hawaii Sports&&&"We are the better team, you can quote me on that," Moanalua coach Arnold Martinez said. "They were the more advantageous team tonight." No sir, you are not the better team. That is why you loss. Check the scoreboard. Your team loss. Moanalua is the more talented team. However, they are poorly coached. They lack discipline. They had so many legit penalties. They talk smack and get penalized. They hit late. They grab facemasks. This is all a sign of being undisciplined. The coach is in love with himself. We were watching the game. Who buys a blow-up tunnel to bring attention. That thing had to be in the high thousands of dollars. Who buys that when the state is in a financial crisis? I'll tell you, it's a guy who's in love with himself who wanted to coach at Kamehameha but didn't get hired. It was clear the Menehune has more talent. But, Ka Makani was the better team. They were more fundamentally sound. Their offense was more crisp. They ran better routes. The were hardly penalized since their kids could keep their cool when they faced adversity. So in end, Coach Martinez is incorrect. He has the team with better athletes, more size, and more players. But, the better TEAM won, which was Ka Makani. Coach Martinez, stop making excuses, stop crying, and show a little humility! It's that very attitude why you will be sitting at home next week reflecting on why you lost to a less talented, but better team.&&&49

Weekly Eater: Hinone Mizunone misses target&&&Yeah yeah, I agree with you! I went there at lunch time twice. The first time was OK.

One of my friend also has been there last time, so we were surprised about her different attitude! Although I've never been there at dinner time, I easily imagine how we will be treated.&&&3

The fact that Iolani defeated the Div I champion Kamehameha makes this year's win sweeter. I do however suggest that the Iolani coaching staff needs to focus more effort with the running backs and the cause of the fumbles. These fumbles were not caused by explosive hits, but rather by the backs dropping the ball. This is a ball security technique issue and that's on the coaches.&&&1

An Akaka Bill supporter---dictated to him by Democratic Party titular head and all around Godfather, Inouye---Schatz demonstrated throughout his self-service that he will do and say anything any other perceived higher ranking Democrat tell him what do and say. Schatz will be missed. But still hated long after we see him in Aala park on an ice diet. The Hawaii Democrats spit you out once you are no longer of any use to them.&&&13

The players who don't conform need to be benched, and no current Warrior is good enough to be an exception to your rule.

Would love for Hawaii to give a young and succesful coach from a small program the opportunity to lead the Warrior program.&&&1

School closures capture attention from across globe - Hawaii News&&&It's easy to blame the Superintendent of Education & the Board of Education but the burden lies on the shoulders of the Democratic party in Hawaii esp. those democratic legislators & their bedpartners, the Unions, who played politics with the governor restricting the budget and showing no leadership and allowing the governor to do what she had no choice to do and then these idiot legislators start to play armchair quarterbacks by saying we should raise taxes, raid the Hurricane Fund yet, not one has showed any profile in courage in taking any leadership position......I repeat, not one of these democratic legislators, have taken any leadership position and all of the legislators are basking in the son as the publicity takes away from them they gouging their 36% pay raise. Local people have to rise up and take notice and stop being local and vote these idiots out of office.

No Hawaii illness reports despite Slim-Fast recall - Hawaii News&&&The reason no sickness is reported is that the disgustingly overweight, obese, fat bodies are already sick, and have been for quite some time, having grown accustomed to that sick state as "normal." Einstein would reduce this into the following mathematical equation: Fat = sick. Well + sick = sick. Always Fat + Sick = normal, so you think you well. Fat and Sick + Tainted Slim Fast = You can't tell the difference, because that's normal. The solution is FASTING.

They have been trying to take over the HC system for many many years, do you really think a few months will make a difference?

Police / Fire - Hawaii News&&&This is what happens when the Governors office is not concerned with the safety of the public. Ask her - where was the security? They were home drawing unemployment because she does not think that the security of the public is a very high priority. The security at the State Hospital and at the State Laboratory were terminated. The State Laboratory has been deemed Critical Infrastructure by the State Civil Defense Director, and the federal Homeland Security office has put the state on notice that the security there was not adaquit, so what does the governor do? She does away with all of the security there. Goes to show her regard for the safety of the public.&&&2
Furlough solution might forfeit prep days - Hawaii News&&&The Lingle administration advisers are .... They were the ones who demanded furlough. Yo, why are the journalists forgetting that Lingle refused to touch the hurricane fund? Teachers are already using their own money to purchase school supplies. Didn't the governor wanted to return more money to the taxpayers. May be she should spend more time in the mainland campaigning; this time to help Sarah Palin sell more books. Without a small tax increase, the current solution is but a bandage. In addition, what has this administration done to diversify the state economic engine?&&&149
Religious right is flexing - Hawaii News&&&This is about being a better people. If we let the filth of society control us, then we have more teenage pregancy, more families that lose influence on their kids, and much higher social costs. Some may find some Christians to be over-bearing and obnoxious. But much practical wisdom can be found in pronoucements from the church including the pope's great work on the economy "Caritas in Veritate". Please don't let the media set the agenda turning this all into an issue about gays. The bigger issues are there too. We need to make ourselves better, more decent people.

Fit to meet the Queen - Hawaii Features&&&The Queen of England has got style and grace all her own. She was a mechanic during WWII too, by the way. It is fantastic that Hawaii's Jake Shimabukuro and Bette Midler will have the opportunity to perform for her. Great Britain and Hawaii have links that reach back to the time of Kamehameha The Great, and his communications to, and alliance with, King George the III. Kamehameha I was solid, just and righteous, but when he passed on in 1819, the "Monarchy" model of government he had allowed to be imported from England, began to take on a different manner of rule, as the vying Chiefs wanted a piece of the lucrative ili'ahi or Sandalwood trade, that Kamehameha I had placed under Kapu. The enormous pressure and ever present threat of revolt against Kamehameha II,(who was under the guidance and defacto rule of Kaahumanu,) cut the chiefs in for some of the lucrative action. However, all were apeing the europeans, desiring to white, and vigorously applying their model of a "Monarchy" style of government, with that "King, Queen," business. The Monarchy is NOT a native Hawaiian concept. It was imported. The result was catasrophic, as the greed of the chiefs became legendary, driving the commoners into the mountains like slaves to denude practically every last plant and tree of ili'ahi, preventing the commoners from tending their food crops that, in turn, led to starvation, aggravated by no resistance to the sudden influx of disease from which the commoners had no resistance, leading to record numbers of deaths amongst the commoner native Hawaiian population. The Hawaiian "Monarchy" in action. But, perhaps the most cruel application of the Monarchy was in 1848, when the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii cheated the common native Hawaiian tenants out of their one-third share of their ancestral lands in the Mahele of 1848. One third of the lands went to Kam III, one-third of the lands went to the greedy 245 chiefs and konohiki, and the remaining one-third was supposed to go to the common native Hawaiian tenants, but did not. The "Monarchy" converted (stole) that undelivered one-third share, and thereafter called it "Government Lands." So, before everybody gets into the "How Great the Queen" or "Your Majesty" or "Your Higness" b.s., just remember what the Monarchy did to the common native Hawaiians, especially the homeless ones you may see around. That is the legacy of the sovereign, independant and corrupt Kingdom of Hawaii monarchy today. Jake and Bette should still have a good time anyhow!&&&4

Isle beach law must prevail - Hawaii Editorials&&&In Hawaii, Federal interference with state's rights over land issues is already a well established practice. More than once, the U.S High court has adjudicated land ownership issues involving Hawaii. The best example is when they ruled in favor of leasehold property owners regarding the land oligarchy maintained by the large estates such as Bishop, Campbell etc. The Florida case is in front of the U.S. High Court because of the "Takings Clause" in the 5th amendment to the U.S. Constitution in which any government is required to pay compensation to any land owner if they "take" any land through eminent domain. In Florida, you can own property to the water line, regardless of the tide. In Hawaii it is to the highest tide line of the year, normally in the winter. The Florida case is about a "Judicial" taking through the State High Court and in Hawaii it is about a "Legislative" taking by the State Legislature. There are complex legal issues being heard on both cases and the forthcoming rulings will have profound effects on everyone's property ownership rights in the future. What the major concern should be to anyone who owns property is how governments continue to expand their reach over private property rights established in common law going back hundreds of years.&&&9
Handling Badgers' O-line a tall order - Hawaii Sports&&&Every time we play a team like Wisconsin the coaches and players always talk up how giant and incredibly talented they are. This inevitably causes our team to be psyched out before the game even starts. This "saucer eyed" mentality in the first quarter usually contributes to us falling too far behind, despite playing better later. It's like "shooting yourself in the foot". When you closely examine it, you are in a way disrespecting yourself when you are in awe of your opponents, and end up giving away something for free. This inevitably gives your opponent license to be even more arrogant towards you. For once, despite the "odds", I would like the coaches and players to a man say that we are not going to let them psych us out, but play cool and confident from the beginning. We have so much to gain from this game. Wisconsin will already have their bowl game. Who wants it more?&&&13
Group travelers give hotel occupancy a lift - Hawaii Business&&&Hotel workers union, Local 5's Eric Gill, in Sunday's paper also commented on the importance of group business, so WHY is the union at public hearings opposing the B&B Bill 7. The union will get little sentiment from me when they renegotiate their contracts and try to push their weight around. Enough is enough. The hotel workers have time to stand around and watch people being attacked and do nothing. They have time to attend multiple hearings during working hours to oppose B&Bs. Everyone in the private sector is taking 10-15 percent cuts. Will the hotel workers accept similar pay cuts?&&&1
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Mr. Kent: Couldn't agree more. But, this "war machine", starting with GW Bush in Iraq, has no limits and no controls. Aside from the moral, ethical, legal questions, the USA is still hell-bent on chasing al-Queda and the Taliban to all corners of the globe, and it doesn't matter to 50% of Americans what it costs to do so. It's the American mind set, and unchangeable...exactly like Vietnam. But now, 40 years later, the cost is astronomical and will bring the USA down. And, we'll still be chasing and killing "enemy combantants" forever.&&&352

This year's team is Div 1 playing in Div 2. It hasn't been like this since you could count the number of kids over 200 lbs with only one hand in previous seasons. They are big (O and D line), mobile and well conditioned. I hope UH offers Mercado a scholarship because he may be the next Jason Elam.&&&1

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr. Witeck, please share with us the knowledge you have that leads you to know why the Afghanistan surge will not work. You say, "The announcement of his plan to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan and to escalate the war there — in the name of supposedly ending it sooner — is double- speak and doubly wrong." You make a declarative statement with no substantive reason to support it. The Iraqi surge worked. Why not this one? As a 28-year member of the armed forces, I have more faith in the American service men and women than I do any pacifist second guessers. It's already become Obama's war. Hopefully he will see it through to victory, a word he doesn't use very often, but the ultimate outcome a majority of the American people want to see. God Bless our Troops and God Bless America.&&&5
Time for reflection - Sports News&&&The difference, of course, is that Iolani is a Division I school that plays in Division I for every sport except football. That means they get to dominate Division II football. The record over the last few years speaks for itself. By doing this Iolani opens up the door for the OIA to put huge Oahu schools like McKinley and Campbell in Division II for sports like basketball. That makes a mockery of the two division system. Schools should not be allowed to pick and choose which Division they are going to be in for individual sports. Either you are Division I for everything or Division II for everything. You'd better read this post quick because the pro-Iolani sports departments of our daily papers like to suppress any criticism of Iolani's manipulation of the Division II system.&&&1

Make no bones about it, turkey keeps on giving - Columnists&&&My recipe for Turkey & Dumplings TURKEY (or chicken) AND DUMPLINGS Bone all the meat off your leftover turkey, set aside Save turkey carcass,(bones, skin, tendons, cartilage, basically all the parts you wouldn’t eat) Place carcass in a large pot with: • 1 carrot • 1 onion, quartered • 2 stalks of celery, washed and cut into 3 pieces •½ teaspoon of salt • Tie the following together in a small clean cloth (cheesecloth) and tie with a string and add to the pot: • 1 bay leaf • 2 whole cloves • 2 cloves of garlic, peeled but not chopped •¼ teaspoon of thyme Fill the pot with enough water to cover the in ingredients and bring to a boil. Lower temperature to a simmer and cook for at least 2 hours until you have a nice stock.(Hint: You can make the stock in your pressure cooker, on high for 20 minutes, no longer). Strain the stock into another large pot and bring to a boil, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste, usually 2 teaspoons of salt,(add the first teaspoon and the rest ½ teaspoons at a time to avoid saltiness). While the stock is cooking, make the dough for the dumplings: • 2 cups flower (use bread flour, makes a better dumpling) • 1 cup water •½ teaspoon salt •½ teaspoon baking powder • 1 tablespoon shortening (Crisco) • Mix all above in a bowl and chill while stock is cooking (chilled dough is easier to work with) When stock is seasoned and tastes done, roll out the dough on a floured surface, adding flour as needed, to a thickness of ¼ inch, no thinner. Cut the dough in 1 ½ inch squares with a pizza cutter, get the stock boiling, and drop the dumpling one at a time in the pot. Once all the dumplings are in the pot, keep the stock boiling for twelve minutes. Turn down the heat, add the turkey, and warm for 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and set aside for 15 minutes uncovered. Enjoy! Note: You can substitute 1 whole chicken for the turkey, just cut the raw chicken up and place in the pot, just as you would the turkey carcass. After the stock has cooked, remove the chicken before straining the stock and bone all the meat off the chicken. Set aside until needed. In you want to make a larger batch (say, to feed a family of 6) make 1 & ½ times the amount of dumplings and add more stock or bullion to the pot. If you fill the pressure cooker to the max line, it will make extra stock, but you will probably have to a teaspoon of chicken bullion to get the proper level of flavor.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Mark, You have twisted some of your figures there. Out of that 40 million you cited, 14 million are eligable for medicaid, 17.6 million make over 50,000 and thus could pay for their own, or just opted out. 9.7 million are not citizens. Please tell me why we should cover the non citizens. We are already picking up the tab for some many things as it is. No where does it say we are automatically entitled to free health care. I believe in covering the very poor and the ones too ill to work. But, heck, the government will soon take care of that problem with the rationing. The 10% for unemployment is really 10.2, but if you figure the ones that have given up hunting for a job, it jumps to 17.5%. As for basic HC, we have always had our hospital ER doors open for those people. Unless you consider the patient dumping and redirecting in Chicago, but you would have to ask Michelle Obama about that. The HC program may be hurt, but our Drs. and Hospitals are not to blame, they are amazing in this country and I will put them against any country out there. The ones hurting the HC in this country, are the special interest groups, ie, attorneys, unions, big pharma. That is where the reform needs to start, but heck, they donated so much money to this prez campaign, they will never be touched. Notice how quiet they have been during all this? If you think governmental HC is the way to go, do some homework and see what is really happening in Europe. How cancer survival rates have soared. How Canada still has 1.2 million looking for a Dr. and their head Dr. says their system is imploding. Or how Sweden is considering private insurance again. And the difference is time for getting surgery from a private vs. public hospital. How the Netherlands practice euthanasia and how some of their Drs. practice non-voluntary euthanasia. Why should the 230 million in this country that are happy with their HC and don't mind paying their fair share to have it, cover those that feel entitled? Be very careful for what you wish for, I don't care to ride your bus.&&&65

In 2010 the Jehovah's Witnesses Watchtower society PR first promotes the economy before Deuteronomy. Most of these JW conventioneers are poor families who saved up all year for these conventions to hear more false prophecies and promises. Getting thousands of followers to assemble all over the world together with some favorable media PR on how they are spending tourist money in a depressed economy assures that most of the local news outlets are not going to print negative information about Jehovah's Witnesses gathering. So,if you or friend,family is being recruited by the Watchtower please go online and Google: Jehovah Witness Watchtower.&&&317

Groups want special session to cancel Furlough Fridays - Hawaii...&&&Sen. Will Espero (D, Ewa-Kapolei-Ewa Beach) said yesterday that other "legislators are willing to commit to a special session if there's an agreed-upon plan that everyone can live with." I appreciate Espero's drive. But he is not going the distance. Guess what Will? We don't care if everyone agrees with a plan. Just get the kids back in school on Fridays, immediately. Meanwhile, Gov. Linda Lingle says she regrets signing off on Furlough Fridays for public schools but opposes calling a special session. Russell Pang, chief of media relations for the governor, said yesterday she believes it is too soon to take action because "we're only three months into the fiscal year, so we need to get a broader picture of how the fiscal year is shaping up." Oh, I see. Lingle regrets signing off on the deal to cheat the future of their education, but really does not want to do anything meaningful about it, because "it is too early in the fiscal year." This is the same Governor who pretends to be a Republican, but then adopts the Democrat plan to invent a fake Indian tribe of 1/64th "Hawaiians" just so that she can be "liked." You're all over the map, Lingle. People who possess leadership, demonstrate that leadership when exigent circumstances required, as here. Instead, you demonstrate a talk out one side of your mouth "let's do something" but then on the other side "we not going do nothing because too early in the fiscal year." Each day you stall, Lingle, and fail to take immediate corrective action, you contribute to the Hawaii Democrat plan to destroy the Republican Party of Hawaii, for free.&&&95

Refine bulky item fine - Hawaii Editorials&&&I has become too easy to just throw bulky items on the sidewalks. Too many people abuse the service and the result has been nothing but filth. Just put an end to this dis-service and people will become once again responsible to dispose of their garbage as it was a little over a decade ago. Some very negative aspects of this government run agency have been contributing to a "throw away" culture in which next to nothing gets its full use nor is recycled. If you get tired of your furniture or you have to move back to the mainland, throw it at the curbside. When you remodel,dump all the refuse on the street. Leave broken water heaters to be a hazard. General contractors and laborers no longer waste their gas or time to go to the dump, but instead drive by and trash up my neighborhood. Hoodlums love to hang out at these dump sites and further destroy the garbage, break mirrors, sell drugs, get drunk, fight and bother me at all hours of the day and night. Once I caught the illegal dumpers and called the police. When the officer arrived, he too witnessed the second load arrive and proceeded to give the perpetrator a ticket when the man clearly stated that he was a city and county employee. The police officer let him and his friend go, then came back and told me off. There is zero enforcement because it is next to impossible to enforce. I hate the once a month Bulky Pickup. It has turned the streets of Oahu into one BIG DUMP!&&&21

Ranch's gift will preserve 11,300 acres of Haleakala slopes for...&&&Those who live here or have traveled there from afar, and have been fortunate to visit Ulupalakua, know of this rare beauty in such a pristine setting on the slopes of Haleakala, overlooking Makena, and Kaho'olawe, on the Island of Maui. A great Mahalo nui loa goes out to the Erdman Family and their extended Ohana, for such a generous gift to the good of Maui, the People of Hawaii, and the World. An unselfish act of simply giving up the huge potential economic profit that would come from raw economic development of such a large section of acreage, in a limited land mass, made even more valuable by limits in an Island setting, this gift from the Erdmans demonstrates they possess the vision to see that it is much more valuable to protect, preserve and perpetuate the rare jewel of Ulupalakua from over development, than it is to make dollars simply to make dollars while ruining the Aina. Seeing the encroachment of economic opportunists willing to sacrifice the natural beauty of any given area, in exchange for greedy economic development, the Erdmans speak loud with their action, and much more than those who pretend to be environmentalists while methodically planning to destroy the Aina. On Oahu, we are burdened with outgoing Mayor Mufi Hanneman's version of "environmentalism," where he has planned to permanent destruction of the last Open Space upon the Ewa Plain, in order to enrich a developer friend and hack, who is counting on "Rail" to pour money into his coffers. Such greed, avarice and selfish profit seeking, that wants to destroy the land, so that a train can be built to spur over development on a piece of land, but is being sold to us as "Green" and "Good for the Environment," stands pale in comparison to this good, unselfish act by the Erdmans to bestow this gift upon the People of Hawaii. We need to protect our dwindling Open Spaces here in Hawaii. We need to derail mufi's scheme to enrich himself, his contractor cronies, p.r. publicists, air-head architects, under productive unions, and all those salivating at the prospect of ruining Oahu and turning Honolulu into the Ugliest City in The World.&&&3

Wisconsin in the way - Hawaii Sports&&&"Nobody thought, except my team and my coaches, that we were going to have a chance at this and now we do," UH head coach Greg McMackin said. "Now we've got to go to work and give it our best shot." Wrong Mack. Don't be ungrateful to your loyal fans. I always believed in the Warriors. Go Warriors !&&&1
Accomplice in murder gets 10-year sentence - Hawaii News&&&Why do these people buy airline tickets to come here and do their dirty work.Stay at home and do it in your town or state.&&&2
Brief asides - Hawaii Editorials&&&I no like Tiger Woods because I hate golfing, and cannot golf. Plus, he rich. If Obama going socialist, then go socialist all the way and seize Wood's assets and use it to help pay down our Nations deficit. The theory is that only rich people play golf, because they have the leisure to waste their time, having accumulated such wealth off the backs and labor of the poor people. Seriously, I am glad Woods did not suffer a fatal injury in the car crash. But, it must've hurt, huh? lol. Another thing, with all the beautiful black women in America, why would Woods want to marry a white foreigner? My guess is Woods deep down wants to be white, and decided to purchase his white wife except in was disguised as some sort of professional golfing courtship or something.&&&1
New trial for Deguair is scheduled for February - Hawaii News&&&The State can get you and sentence you for meth and a pipe, 10 years, no less. Shoot someone in the back of the head, push them off of a cliff, in front of witnesses no less and your free to go back Jack and do it again. Hawaii still sucks.I wonder what Deguair plans for an encore. It's a wonder Hawaii doesn't sink under all of the crap that continues to walk it streets.&&&14
Car thief suspect was guilty in the past - Hawaii News&&&Perhaps these 3 shooting incidents involving auto theft will be a wakeup call to those with the propensity to steal. It's a shame that our judicial system, including prosecutors, can't seem to get a handle on prosecuting these individuals. They either plea deal them down or in the case of judges, let them go with a "slap on the wrist." Hats off to HPD for at least doing their job.&&&47

Bustamante wins top police safety award - Hawaii News&&&Officer Bustamante is well known in the Waimanalo community. He has been assigned here for some time. Officer Bustamante treats people fairly. He is one of the reasons crime is on the decline in Waimanalo. He doesn't just respond to crimes. He prevents them by recognizing people and action that are out of place and stopping criminal activity before it occurs. The drug dealers fear him! The neighborhood children look up to him. What more can be said!!&&&1
McMackin's decision showed faith in defense - Further Review&&&Whatever. It's all good now because the defense held. He should have at least called a timeout and went with a a better play instead of that weak looking dive that Navy's D-line blew up.&&&4
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&The people arrested on illegal fireworks possession should be tried on national security issues as being potential terrorists. Neighbors that notice an increase in traffic in their residential area or a container parked in a residential area to unload goods should notify the FBI, TSA,and police. It is only through the neighbors vigilance will these illegal fireworks be stopped.&&&11

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Sandy Afterburn is wrong wrong wrong. Unlicensed B&Bs are illegal and should be reported. If they are legal then nothing happens except a visit from an inspector. What are you afraid of, that your illegal B&B will be closed? Imagine that, a law that works.&&&33
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Pedestrians always have the right of way. But, courtesy works two ways. In the Waikiki area, for example, many scofflaws ignore the No Walk flashing signal. Others, not in the side walk, and seeing you approaching, knowing it will disrupt the flow of traffic arrogantly step into the side walk when it could have just been easier for them to wait for you to pass. These latter ones I do not appreciate and will keep going. Other pedestrians stand right on the curb, endangering their lives and damage to our vehicles too! But this is all small potatoes compared to many rude drivers on Honolulu's roads that outweigh the few courteous drivers that restore my faith in humanity on a daily basis. Bottom line is a sidewalk will not protect you from being run over.&&&47
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Isle bank getting back on its feet? Hey, Andrew Rosen, I hope not, I hope they fail forever because.,they buck salls. Central Pacific Bank is a joke. I had banked there for many years, then went in for a $6000 loan and was denied. This was during thier huge "Loyalty" advertising campaign!! I then walked directly across the street to First Hawaiian Bank (where I had no account) and secured a loan on the spot. Was cut a check for $6000 RIGHT THEN AND THERE!!!! Walked back across the street and closed my account of many years at CPB, moved everything to FHB. CPB = LOSERS, hope you fail. Loyalty IS everything !!&&&28
Economic recovery -- 'Hawaiian style' - Hawaii Editorials&&&Nobody is stopping the Hawaiians from becoming the most successful people in these islands. If the Hawaiian culture is so powerful why are theyre so my young Hawaiians on drugs, who beat their spouses, dont want to work, only want to collect welfare? Hawaiians are the only culture that would prefer to look back than to look forward.&&&25
Funding to fix rough roads must wait - Hawaii Editorials&&&Doesn't it take years for road to "deteriorate"? Roads "deteriorate" when you allow them to "deteriorate" don't they? If you had maintained the roads all along they would not be in such bad shape today would they? So then it seems logical to ask, why did they allow the roads to deteriorate, when they had a much stonger tax base? Is that an unreasonable question to ask?&&&9
Gregory House director honored - Hawaii News&&&did they name the company after House MD?&&&2
Honolulu police shoot and injure suspected auto thief&&&When I am on jury duty... I will judge. Until then, it's not my call on what happened or didn't happen. If the officer made a poor decision, be sure to blame his/her boss, blame the poor training, blame the selection process, blame the poor recession, blame the old boy seniority network, blame the budget cuts, or just blame the job itself. Also, blame the crook for deciding to steal someone else's car and for deciding to place the officer or the public in danger. I paid for my speeding ticket. And I don't get too upset when I see the overweight officers getting overtime for assisting construction or directing traffic at black friday events. It's a stressful job and I'm glad they are doing it instead of me. Brah, maybe we should strike during this time of recession instead of take a paycut to keep our jobs.&&&1

Chaminade using gifts to start nursing major - Hawaii News&&&Wow, congratulations to Chaminade University. They have done well in identifying regents who are leaders and who walk the talk. Maybe the Chaminade University team can help advise the governor how to appoint regents for the UH system. The UHM grants 76% of the undergraduate degrees but it alum does not seem to give back to the institution. When was the last time we heard of a member of the BOR giving so generously? Thank you Dr. Miyawaki and Dr. Tseu for setting the examples!&&&3
Dim view of headlights - Kokua Line&&&When there's a bright light your eyes tends to gyrate towards it like a moth to a flame. Yes there are insensitive people out there but another explanation of the bright lights is not even due to the high beam setting but rather from halogen bulbs having a high lumen output. Imagine if these specialized bulbs are in high beam! Good golly miss molly... it's like daylight!&&&4

Wie should think about bringing the trophy home - Columnists&&&Whoa, Nelly! I'm just as big a Wie fan as anyone, but she would be in a much better position to have her own tournament--with a lot more credibility--with about 3-4 years worth of multiple victories under her belt. I fully expect her to very soon crack the top 10 and eventually become dominant, but that should happen BEFORE she once again puts herself in cart-before-horse mode. I'd say a Hawaii tournament in her name might make a great Baccalaureate graduation present. Good thought, just a little ahead of it's time. GBU, MDJ.†&&&81

Army to gauge electricity billing - Hawaii News&&&About time for this. I know too many military families that leave their lights/AC/appliances, etc. on when they leave their homes because they don't have to pay any electric bills. They don't care about the cost of electricuty because Uncle Sam (us taxpayers) foot the bill. Give them a normal amount each month for free, then charge them for any overage. Maybe they'll become more responsible.&&&2
Hit Men - Special Projects&&&Are you dreaming?? There is no way Hawaii will be able to stop Navy. I mean, c'mon, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Air Force, etc...schools waaaay better than Hawaii couldn't stop Navy, what makes you think Hawaii will be able to stop Navy. Give me a break!! Face reality!! Don't be deluded by Hawaii's wins over San Jose State, Utah State, New Mexico State 'n think Hawaii's defense is starting to come around. Playing against the worse teams in Div. 1 is not like playing Navy.&&&28
Audit calls for Liu's ouster - Hawaii News&&&Why the backlash against state auditor Marion Higa? Is it because she's not a 'team player' or is it she's the only one courageous enough to peel back the facade that seems to be obscuring massive state mismanagement and fraud? I always thought audits were a good thing. Several well documented articles in the Hawaii Free Press have revealed rampant government waste in just the DOE alone: Now if you expand that investigation into other "Lingle-protected-hands-o ff" departments, perhaps we would find out what's really happening with tax revenues in the halls of government. If there is this reluctance into transparency and accountability, then somebody's hiding something that they don't want us "little people" to find out.&&&78
Warriors defense caused Navy to run out of options - Hawaii Sports&&&Dave, thank you for this article. Warriors deserves the accolades. I want to point out exceptional play by Tuika Tufaga and Vaughn Meatoga on defense, and Alex Green on offense for his blocking. Pilares was outstanding on offense with Moniz playing a near perfect game. O-line, led by Estes, played good.&&&8

Jobless insurance deficit to spark tenfold tax hike - Business ...&&&With this type of unemployment tax increase for small businesses does anyone really think any small business will do much business here in Hawaii? There is very little small business now and this will just kill the rest of them off. You can only screw the small businesses so much until they all vanish then you will only have the government left. It does not take much thinking to figure out that this will backfire so you are really screwing your own self because of your own greed.&&&6

McMackin and Company, certainly, were well prepared... Good win, and bigger game coming up against a Top 25 level team in Wisconsin... Brings back memories of having to beat Northwestern and Michigan State in 05 to get in the Hawaii Bowl... Hopefully, the game is well officiated...&&&3

UH's Mighty Mo excels - Hawaii Sports&&&I watched that game and my heart burst with pride when the UH team won. There were some scary moments but it just made the game that much more thrilling. I, for one, still believe guys. Keep up the good work. Whether you get to play in the Sheraton Bowl or not you're still Hawaii's team. Thanks for the thrills.&&&13
S. Carolina rift highlights debate about GOP's future - New Yor...&&&IT'S ALREADY STARTING. The dictator hussein obama/democrat media (the star bulletin and honolulu advertiser included) will be hammering in and exaggerating any stories negatively associated with the Republican Party. And this they will do to maintain the status quo in Congress to help the dictator advance his MARXIST/SOCIALIST agenda. If the people of America fall for this ploy as they did in the last presidential election which the dictator hussein obama was elected, then we Americans deserve a MARXIST/SOCIALIST country.&&&2
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Barbara Kim Stanton, State director, AARP Hawaii wrote: "...A Nov. 22 letter to the editor mischaracterized why AARP supports health care reform...". AARP's actions speak louder than words and the reality of AARP's position in supporting this legislation is that AARP will benefit more from the bill than those who they claim to represent. AARP, like so many other special interest lobbying organizations is another Beltway fat cat looking for favors in return for their endorsements and is now just another brick in the pathway to tax hell. If it says AARP, it goes with the junk mail.&&&27

Streak means nothing with 8-3 Navy heading in - Hawaii Sports&&&Finally, someone has got it right. Thank you Mr. Reardon for pointing out that fact about Hawaii beating teams with grossly losing records. One important fact you left out is that San Jose St., as of last week, was the 4th worse football team in Div. 1 'n both Utah State 'n New Mexico St., incl. Hawaii, was also in the Bottom Twenty worse football teams in the nation. i can't really get excited about Hawaii winning nor can I get excited when Coach Mack talks about his defense is coming around and blah..blah...blah..I know people reading my blog will decry my blog as being negative and that I am a pessimist but I have been a UH fan attending their games going back to the late '60's at the old Honolulu Stadium and even was there when Bobby Ahu made three spectacular punt returns for touchdowns against Linfield so I have seen it all but Hawaii beating or on a winning streak against three teams in the Bottom Twenty...well, like I said, can't really get excited about it.&&&36

UH move to downtown was deemed too costly - Hawaii News&&&Move, no move; no matter. UH-Manoa: Hog cheese of the UH System. Headquarters of the East-West (but mostly all East) Center. Football Coach: National Crybaby. Football Team: Led by a loser crybaby who gotta march around and hold hands with gays and lesbians for "educate" us. He's getting paid a MILLION of YOUR dollars to do this too! Their Slogan: "Go Green" designed to milk the pseudo environmentalist market, eating Big Macs sprinkled with granloa, while spewing plumes of carbon emissions down the freeway to commune with nature, while driving their foreign import Exterra plastered with a "Save the Aina" sticker.&&&12
Developing An Air Fleet - Hawaii Editorials&&&What are they smoking? This is 2009, and the Navy department is stuck in 1941. We can't afford military planning strategies for acts that simple won't and will not ever possibly happen. Stop living under the Pentagon propaganda mushroom and look at the real threats. That's Terrorism, and certainly can't be fought with our military of today.

Someone must start the offense so all the team strenghts are used. Lets fave Keisha is great but just a turn over machine, cuz for the team to have a chance she must. You Coach and only you can create the offense scheme to put Keisha and the other players performing at their best. Lita, Shawana,Patterson, Yes Wilson and Ayabe, all of them playing under controlled mayhem and win some games. Let go Wahines.&&&1
Windward traffic cams - Kokua Line&&&Don't get all excited about the new windward traffic cams.

Time will tell if the windward cams were was done right, traditionally HDOT is not up to the task of maintaining the cams. Just another day in the Nei.&&&10

New Mexico pulls away from UH - Sports News&&&the offense is lost. everyone just stands around and we end up forcing jumper after jumper. we will be a team of offensive runs when the jumpers are falling but will have prolonged droughts like we've seen almost every game when the shots aren't dropping. the defense is even worse. i have never seen a UH team give up so many layups. and what was nash thinking having his entire team go to the other side of the court near the end of the first half? he conceded the rebound on the missed free throw. hey coach, in case you didn't notice, your team does not shoot free throws well. you might want to have your players around to grab an occasional rebound.&&&2
The last haul - Hawaii Business&&&Too late to bring back the SuperFerry, the baga gone and so is the kala that it would have bring and jobs. But I guess the people has all the answer on how too save their island. I grew up on plantation land and worked at Kahuku Sugar, went to war and came back and the plantation closed. My dad worked there 45yrs and couldn't retired. So here Iam on the big island of America and it take 2 weeks to go around this island. The grass is green and the leipo is red and gray like home, but we have the 4 season. Oh yes did I mention its alot cheaper up here. The people don't have any aloha till they know you're from Hawaii.

It angered me to no end when I heard that acorn was paying campaign worker for every new voter they signed up. But, that's what you get with community organizers! CORRUPTION/MARXISM/SOCIALISM!!&&&3
Expired safety sticker can be grounds for tow - Kokua Line&&&So, lets see if I got this straight. The police officer's car was not towed because it did, in fact, have a current inspection, but the sticker fell off exposing the old, expired sticker- and somehow his fellow police officers knew this, dispite seeing only the expired sticker, and did not have their buddy's car towed, as they did other cars on the street with expired stickers visible.

New techniques in brain surgery mix hope with risk - New York T...&&&Dr. Darin D. Dougherty, director of the division of neurotherapeutics at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard, put it more bluntly. Given the history of failed techniques, like frontal lobotomy, he said, "If this effort somehow goes wrong, it'll shut down this approach for another hundred years." ....that might be a damned good idea and the most realistic approach to treatment of that sort. What do most of you out there in TVland think?&&&3

U.S. postmaster should get report of mail fraud - Hawaii News&&&I received a letter with a return address of Des Voeux Road Central, Central No. 39 (World Wide House) 28F. It had a Taiwan canceled postage stamp. Inside was an ad inviting the public to buy its travel services to Southeast Asia and other parts of the world. This is a downtown Hong Kong address. It may have been sent from Taiwan, but the return address is without a doubt from Hong Kong. Hope the postal service can figure that out.&&&1

Beyond Kona coffee - Hawaii Business&&&with careful cultivation over time, hawaii has become a respected and desired source of good coffee. congratulations to the growers who've worked hard to make that happen. but there is a worm in the coffee beans; the presence of gmo coffee in the islands. big difference between big island coffee and the rest - on hawaii no gmo coffee is allowed. on the other islands it is and wherever its grown (and they aren't telling) it can hybridize with any other coffee out there within the range of its pollinators which for bees can be from two to six miles. the high end buyers know this. if you start your day with a good cup of coffee wouldn't you like to know its doesn't have any surprises in it?&&&6
Fugitive caught in isles gets 6 years for child molestation - H...&&&This sick son of a ***** came up with excuses that make me sick. How can a little girl give out "agressive sexual behaviour"? Or genital curiosity. His actions of sexual assault are most disturbing and what is unbelievable is they gave him only 6 years. How can this be so? We already know that this category of child molester it is useless to let out of incarseration. We all know that he will offend again when released. We all know that he is willing to runaway when he reoffends. As a grand parent when I look at my grand children I can see that these people are all around us. One only has to google that molester website to become concerned. Try it you will never let your kids outside to play again.&&&11

Teachers without time to plan would be baby sitters - Guest Edi...&&&Matthew LoPresti's essay is pure baloney. Of course teachers should do planning. Nobody would dispute that. But LoPresti seems to think teachers simply cannot get it together to do planning unless there is time set aside during the school day for them to do it, and of course, according to LoPresti, there must be money set aside to pay them for the time they spend to make their plans. Teachers are supposed to be professionals. That means they take the time to make their lesson plans while they are sitting monitoring a study hall, or while they are at home. For 30 years I was a professor and a public school teacher; and I did a LOT of research and planning; but I would never have expected to have paid time during the school day to plan my lessons, grade my students' papers, etc. Kwitcherbellyachin and start acting like a professional.&&&1

A great game is expected and if all mistakes is corrected we shall see a classic prelude to next weeks Championship. May the best team win. Cheee..hu!!!&&&1

Bring in Steve Vai. Whispering a Prayer is something all should hear by Vai, protege of the late virtuoso and genius: Frank Zappa. If Thompson can play Whispering a Prayer like Vai, I might waste more time posting here.&&&6
Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Apparently Kamehameha I's "Law of the Splintered Paddle" didn't apply to Hawaiians living on Maui, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Molokai and Oahu. They were not protected from senseless attack by those more powerful. Many of them were brutally killed when an invader from the island of Hawaii attacked their islands in a bloodthirsty land and power grab. Basic civil rights of life and safe passage seem to have been suspended while Oahu natives were getting shoved off the Pali cliffs. The people of Kauai would have met a similar fate except that the great Hawaiian mariners and navigators (or so we are led to believe) couldn't manage to sail the few extra miles to get there. My point? Let's stop pretending that native Hawaiians lived in an idyllic paradise free from violence and hardship. Let's stop advocating a return to a monarchy when nobody else thinks hereditary authoritarian government is a good idea. And let's stop fantasizing that life was so much better when living in the stone age.&&&55
Newswatch - Newswatch&&&What the matter with this guy?! I thought he was a local boy but I think he caught the Mufi flu instead. I know that the people of Kauai will halt this eye sore and waste of county money. If they can stop the ferry they surely can stop this idiot.&&&2

Dim view of headlights - Hawaii Features&&&To that person who thinks 99% of the drivers are using their highest level of lights. Have your eyes checked. I also went through a period where my eyes were very sensitive to lights. I thought other drivers were inconsiderate and doing this on purpose. I have found out my eyes sensitivity was a medical problem.&&&26
Humpback protection may go - Hawaii News&&&Alright! The Humpbacks have recovered, so let's go out there and begin killing them all off again, until they can get relisted as endangered. Save the whales...collect the whole set! Are we proud of ourselves, that we can almost exterminate a whole species, and now, given the chance to do the right thing, we'll no doubt just kill as many of them as possible again? Can't we declare them a desired species, and save them forever for slaughter? Too bad they can't fight back.&&&21

Keep up the good work and best of luck to you Kenny! Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Have a blessed day of prayers and thanks! Go Warriors too!&&&4

Just like Vietnam, Iraq and now Afghanistan, the USA spends billion, even a trillion and coutless deaths to prop up and try to stabilize foreign governments that are NOT sustainable.

No plans to cancel Honolulu City Lights - Columnists&&&Why isn't Mufi taking advantage of fountain coin funding? Put signs stating how they (largely tourists) will be blessed if they toss in quarters (not smaller change). False advertising and crooked, perhaps, but Mufi is doing the same with residents of Honolulu regarding rail, only that we're talking billions instead of a few thousand.&&&3

From the bottom of my heart I hope you all find some sort of peace in the days and years to come. God bless.&&&4

Prevent bridge disasters - Hawaii Editorials&&&This is yet another signal of the harrowing effects of spending more than 50% of tax revenues on military and so-called defense matters. The decision to sacrifice the once world-class infrastructure of the US and spend more on defense each year than the rest of the world COMBINED yields broken bridges, rotting water pipes, overflowing sewage systems, third-world ghettos, failing schools, a health care system that's broken, inadequate railroads, and on and on. Visitors to US cities from Europe are shocked to see the corroded, eroded, rusted mess of our urban infrastructure. Travelers to Japan, Europe, etc. marvel at their clean, efficient, extensive and well operated public transportation and services ... all of which are paid for by tax revenues the likes of which we pour down the drain of endless warfare.&&&13
Police / Fire - Hawaii News&&&So many crimes are also committed on our outer island as we have wittnessed on the last 2 days police blotter. Reading comments on the possisbilty of the SF rise from the dead some comments were made about Oahus big city crime. One blogger comes to mind(Namaste) with his rediculous comment that the SF's coming to the Big Island. He claimed that car theives and burglars would come by SF to the big island and then do their dirty deeds and be home on the night time return. This shows to me why we have so many problems with trying to get new business started here in Hawaii. I can see intelligent opposition, because there always will be some for and some against. To use a lame response such as this or Oahus homeless will be coming in droves shows you how desperate and ignorant some people are. The SF's return is SLIM and NONE but still it reflects how dumb some are. If they said drugs would be traveling with the Ferry or rapers of the resources I can understand but please say something intelligent.&&&1
Judge bars evidence from tainted search - Hawaii News&&&Congratulations Judge Seabright for becoming the valiant defender and protector of pedophiles in Hawaii. I wonder - how you would feel if it was YOUR child or grandchild in those photos? Judges in Hawaii are among the most morally vacant and ethically challenged fools imaginable but you have set a new low in the history of judicial failure. Thanks a lot for making Hawaii a more dangerous place to live for our children and a safer home to child pornography. You must be so proud of yourself.&&&59

U.S. is seeking 10,000 troops from its allies - Hawaii News&&&Using this analogy, the US is like a salesman when it comes to selling other countries an argument for their supplying additional troops. And like most salesmen, the US had better be able to handle the very worse thing most salesmen are confronted with. REJECTION. Maybe it's time to get out of Afghanistan and let the corrupt government and many of its citizens stew in their own juices.&&&2
Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"America cannot afford health care reform bill" Think hidden costs.

Free healthcare is NOT free period.&&&58

This is Porkulus money thrown down a rat hole and charged to our grandkids' credit cards??? Keep voting these Dumocrappic clowns back into office, lolos, and you'll get much more of the same!

Australia's move on credit card fees may have lessons for U.S. ...&&&I've already noticed that Citibank has been increasing the number of points needed to obtain a free reward gift card. What Citibank doesn't realize yet is that their customers will start using their other credit cards more if they devalue their credit cards by asking their customers to use more points for the same reward gift cards. I earn 3 points when I shop at supermarkets, gas stations and drug stores using my Citibank credit card. If I'm shopping elsewhere, I use my Bank of Hawaii Hawaiian Miles credit card that gives me 1% or 1 point for each dollar spent. If Citibank reduces the difference in the 2 reward programs by increasing the number of points needed to receive a free reward gift card, customers like me will start placing more charges with their competitor's credit card.&&&1

The Blind Side - Hawaii Movie Showtimes&&&This is an absolutely enjoyable movie loaded with compassion, humility, generosity, humor and lots of gumption. Even if it wasn't based on a true story, the fact that the Tuohy's were well off financially made this a very credible story. Leigh Anne's (Bullock) character is firm, bold, loving, and honestly color blind. Tim McGraw was the typical husband married to a strong woman - funny, fearful (of what she would do next), tolerant - a very good match for Bullock's character. Big Michael - well, he was a VERY lucky soul in the right place at the right time, with a marshamallow heart, a conscience to know not to screw up, and the gumption to fight the many odds stacked against him. In summary, Blind Side is one of the best motivational movies I have seen in many, many years. I give it 5 stars and would buy the DVD when it came on the market.&&&1
Keep heat on child abuse - Hawaii Editorials&&&Success...It feels so good. Protect the children. Four dead in Hawaii is four to many. Ice (Meth) is still a problem but the sweet smell of sucess is in the air. Remain diligent to your work and keep the family court open on furlough days. Family and domestic violence does not take holidays. TRO's...court orders, and administrative actions are often required immediately. These are the last people that should be furloughed. As reported, "keeping the family together" might make some difference. This is a very good reort for the Lingle Administration. Congradulation to those public servants.&&&13

All players involved in the incident should be removed from the team. Suspended from the team is just a bandaid solution.

Miami ponders the impact of years of development - New York Times&&&Honolulu's unique character and ambiance is also going down the toilet under the myopic mayor and his circle of greedy friends. The Rail is only a pretext for rampant and uncontrolled growth on Oahu. Zoning regulations will be waived and tax breaks offered to the developers to ensure that our beautiful island is ruined by overdevelopment.&&&8

Hawaii keiki will suffer if we handicap them - Hawaii Editorials&&&The shortened school year doesn't help, but the bigger issue is why students are being promoted when they don't achieve the standard. Parents and principals put pressure on teachers not to give F's. Social promotion is still the rule. If they can't do 2nd grade work, putting them into the 3rd grade will only frustrate and alienate them. They will end up pulling down all the other students, because the teacher will spend time answering the student's questions or reviewing what the students should already have learned. If the state were serious about passing NCLB, they'd separate the students who are not working on grade level and put them in classes to help them catch up. Cut out everything except math and English, until they catch up. I know people will argue about the need for art, music, etc. but those classes will not help the student to catch up. They will just keep falling further behind.&&&36
As pine goes under, prep fields well on new crops - Hawaii Edit...&&&Not a problem, the tree hugging environmentalists will stop any progress and make sure no jobs are created. Better to be out of work, hungry and in the dark at all costs.&&&20
Environmental Council needs better support - Hawaii Editorials&&&I thought these were unpaid positions? what kind of resources are we talking about here? Donuts money for these volunteers to meet and discuss how to screw the state? What good is the council when the Super Ferry project was rejected by activist wackos who used the court system to hurt Hawaii's commerce. I am sure Young Brothers' ships are environmentally sound! What about all the dirt the power plants creates using oil and coal? How much money do you want? Do you want to raise taxes? Just tell us be a sheep vote democrap&&&10

The gloves come off at Amazon and Wal-mart - New York Times&&&Walmart's selection if you look very closely is a mile wide but only 24 inches deep...The web's choice selection is infinite in width and depth. This is a battle between bits and atoms and bits cost nothing to store. I-tunes is the largest retailer of music not Walmart who wants CD's when u can download tracks for 99 cents. See Chris Anderson's book "The long tail"&&&2
Honolulu Zoo entrance gets facelift&&&With the bad ecconomy couldn't that amount of money be put to better use ? I worked at the Honolulu zoo for several years and I didn't seen anything wrong with the entrance atleast not worth spending 3.2 million dollars to replace !&&&3
City proposes $500 per day fine for bulky item policy violators&&&Although the fine is steep, I hope that this legislation passes and curbs dumping. For a state that's main industry is tourism, it is important that the island is presentable. More and more areas have unsightly trash like beds, tires and couches on the sidewalk for weeks. It looks like the whole island is a dump.&&&1

Keep lid on crime, fears - Hawaii Editorials&&&I have participated in several important events with other citizens concerned about the direction of the State or Federal Gov.or an action by the Governor that is harmful. Yet, altho, press releases are sent to all the media,there is little or no coverage.Why is that? Who makes these decisions to keep the public ignorant?&&&4
Inouye urges competition in campaign for governor - Hawaii News&&&the Senior Senator can encourage all he wants, but all the cards are already stacked against anyone wanting to run against the machine 1) Mayor grandstands with all major union leaders on television regarding multi-billion dollar project 2) Mayor rushes to lock in huge part of billion dollar contract with contractor before the approvals are in 3) Mayor holds $500 per plate fundraiser with 1000 people buying-in This how the game is played ladies and gentlemen, please step right up --- you are are all encouraged to run&&&53
Restaurants penalize diners by asking them to leave tips - Gues...&&&you have obviously never really worked in the hospitality business - managers and corporations do not get a cut of the server's tips. The servers who are serving you also have rent and can barely take out their parents to dinner. We get minimum wage, have to deal with high stress situations with ungrateful and rude customers. You are obviously a difficult person in general so how can you expect great service if you can't even be a decent human being to others.&&&12
Rainbow Wahine's chance to host doomed by WAC - Hawaii Sports&&&With reference to why No. 3 Wahine cannot host, I absolutely totally disagree with the rationale. Fair is fair. The No. 3 team deserves to host, regardless of strength of schedule. This is another slap at Hawaii "coming from a weak conference." Poor excuse. Wahine has demonstrated year after year it is a very good program. AD Donovan needs to press the matter with the NCAA.&&&2
Wahine get Fresno in semis - Hawaii Sports&&&Aloha na wahine. I know you'll do great in the WAC Tournament and come out with the Championship that will lead you into the NCAA'S playoffs. I've read really negative feedbacks about you in other publishings and find it very disturbing on how some of fans feel about your status. Yes, you're not as tall as those trees that some of the teams have on the mainland but to your advantage, I don't think anyone's quicker than you. Lightning quick will be your key to make it to the final four and possibly if you all believe it can be done, win the National Championship. I always thought that if you could move at warp speed, no one will figure you out. I'm just happy to see y'all playing at your level as the #3 squad and not playing down to the levels of the teams below your status. All in all if Akua see's it fit for you to win the Championship, so be it. Be brave, be proud, be valiant. Most of us here in Hawai'i got your backs no matter what and we're very proud of you. Have fun, hang loose, take care of each other and teach each other valor. Coach Shoji and staff good luck and thanks again for another awesome season. God bless all of us as we head into the holiday season, Happy Thanksgiving and Mele Kalikimaka a me ka Hau'oli Makahiki Hou......Maka...........&&&2

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&The 1/2 percent that is collected on Oahu only belongs to Honolulu, except for the exorbinate fee the state charges the county to collect the tax. It is in fact a county tax and does not belong to the state and the legislature cannot take it for state purposes. The other counties do not pay that portion of the tax. The rest of the state does not pay for Oahu's rail or the tax.&&&34
Hawaii's famed white sandy beaches are shrinking&&&I noticed the last time I visited Waikiki Beach there seem less beach than when I lived there back in the 1990's if that is caused by the gobal warming that is very serious , is the State of Hawaii doing anything to put sand back on to the beach ? The way things are going in 50 years the beach may start at Kuhio Ave.!&&&34
Surfer turns love of sea into booming business - Travel&&&Cheryl Chee Tsutsumi, could you please write about someone that is NOT exposing & raping our natural resources by greedy PROFITEERS, like Carol Philips of Los Angeles, California. Another article about a woman that continues to destroy our "backyard" in the sole pursuit of more & more AMERICAN DOLLARS? Believe it or not, there are companies with business models that protect our environment and do NOT create additional traffic, over-crowding in our small communities and on our beaches. What's even more scary is the danger they put people in... Ever hear about Surfer's myelopathy? The fact is, they are putting a lot of people - that don't know any better, in a very dangerous situation. You named your column Hawai`i's backyard - yet, you CHOOSE to write about a person and a business-model that is dependent on the trafficking of TOURISTS into a fragile eco-system - further polluting the visual, auditory & natural environment with their mere presence? My grandparents taught us to take care of the people and place that is our "backyard" This is the 2nd straight article that you wrote about foreign women born outside of Hawai`i, moving from CALIFORNIA to exploit our natural environment. Do you consider the outcome of your articles? Do you think about the behavior you encourage by your writings? You named your column "Hawai'i's backyard" yet you choose to write about "Californians invading Hawai`i"&&&5

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr. Worrall, Your letter shows you do understand the true number of people w/o insurance that need it. I agree there needs to be some changes, but, until gov't stops pandering to the special interest groups, not much will be accomplished. You will most like notice how quiet the attorneys and Big Pharma have been on this issue. Because of the huge contributions to the sitting prez election. Deals have been made with these two groups. You can't listen to the AMA, since only 15-17% of the Drs. belong. If it continues on this same road, the big losers will be you and your Drs. There is no way we can pass a program this large and not add one more Dr. to the mix. But that is what they are trying to tell us. And yet, they admit, with this new HC, there will be 40 million still left uncovered. Who are these people and why? We only need to cover 10 million to begin with, so that means, some people with insurance will now lose theirs. Some people are pushing for this HC, because they can pay for theirs, but just don't want to. The American worker, does not owe it to these people to pay for theirs. There is no reason to take over the system in place today and disrupt the 240 million with insurance that are happy. Take the fraud out of medicare and medicaid and you have your money. But, it isn't about giving to those that truly need insurance, it is about total takeover of our lives. In the past few days, there has been a push for women ages 40-49 to do without any breast mammagrams for those years. Soon it will be men not having their PSA tested. We now have the highest survival rate for cancer in the world. This will soon change. Welcome to the introduction to ration health care.&&&53

Farrington cools Honokaa - Hawaii Sports&&&There were a rash of penalties on both sides but if Honokaa thought they were tough or they could intimidate Farrington, they find out they were thoroughly mistaken. Don't they know where FHS is located and the ruggedness 'n toughness of their neighborhood. These country bumpkins called the Honokaa dragons were lucky the game was played on the Big Isle cuz if it was here, they would have been run right out of the stadium. The DRAGON WAS SLAIN!!!&&&22
Baby born on board diverted flight - Hawaii News&&&Friday is tomorrow. Did this happen in the future, or is the dateline somehow involved? I thought you could not fly if you're were 8+ months pregnant.&&&9
Summer rebound possible - Hawaii Business&&&We need to stop this gloom and doom scenario put forward by travel related businesses. Hawaii remains a great value for extended stay travelers, and the market has responded by giving great value. Hotels are giving great rates and value. We need to understand that we will have to experience some reduced profitability in the short term (and that includes Waikiki landlords).&&&20
On the safe side - Hawaii News&&&Many people probably think that there is no improvement in the crime situation because certain local TV stations and newspapers seem to be fixated on crime reporting. The level of crime could drop by 90% in a year but one wouldn't know it by watching the TV news and reading the paper. Maybe historical crime stats should be reported more often in order to put the media's reporting into perspective.&&&43
The REAL Unemployment Figures&&&According to the government's broadest measure of unemployment, some 17.5 percent are either without a job entirely or underemployed. The so-called U-6 number is at the highest rate since becoming an official labor statistic in 1994. The number dwarfs the statistic most people pay attention tothe U-3 ratewhich most recently showed unemployment at 10.2 percent for October, the highest it has been since June 1983. The difference is that what is traditionally referred to as the "unemployment rate" only measures those out of work who are still looking for jobs. Discouraged workers who have quit trying to find a job, as well as those working part-time but looking for full-time work or who are otherwise underemployed, count in the U-6 rate.&&&2
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&The argument for keeping HC&S around is similar to the one used by tobacco farmers. "Family, values, history". "My daddy farmed tobacco, so did his daddy and his daddy", and so it goes. Sugar is garbage, is directly linked to obesity and Type II diabetes. There are 8 "sweeteners" on grocery shelves that provide the "taste" without the archaic "farming" of sugar in the islands. Pineapple was at least healthful, and that went away.&&&7
Judge sustains Makua complaint - Hawaii News&&&I do not like some of Mollway's opinions and decisions, and I believe in supporting our US Military in general and the US Army at Makua in particular. However the "poking a stick in the ground and calling it a survery" language is kinda---well---unarguably alright. What can you say? I guess it's William Aila guys trying to restore the monarchy and hassle the Army too, as part of their perceived piece meal plan to drive out the US presence in Hawaii, that kinda gets on my nerves. His gang is part of the those encouraging or egging on those painting large bed sheets you may see around from time to time. Bucks for lolos. Still, Judge Mollway is regrettably right: the Army gotta do it right. After all, there is the right way, the wrong way and the US Army way.&&&8

Punchbowl fire leaves 5 homeless - Hawaii News&&&For all of you people that feel sorry for this family.... Don't worry, in a few weeks you will get over it and start yelling at them telling them "homeless" to go and get an F'n job. Like so many others... you will have forgotten what made them homeless to start with. you need to remember the others as well.&&&9
Man shot in police encounter - Hawaii News&&&Seems like anytime there's a shooting involving a police officer, numerous rounds are expended by the officer. After the officer is returned to duty, the first stop should be the firing range, to better his shooting skills. As taught in the Marine Corps, "one round, one kill."&&&3
Infant's remains returned to couple - Hawaii News&&&Sometimes even "bad people" will do something good to overshadow their criminal activity, and this is an example of it. One can't imagine what was going on in the minds of both parties as the transfer of ashes was being made, but it had to have been an emotional moment. I'm happy for the Mejia family, and credit goes to the "bad person" who was compassionate enough to return the ashes.&&&18

Bullock is the one to watch in 'Blind' - Hawaii Features&&&I concur. All of these protagonists protesting about the homelessness problem, complaining to the Mayor & Governor, complaining about not enough funds for more services and projects should see this film and then ask themselves the question WHY DON'T THEY EMULATE WHAT THE TUOHYS DID AND TAKE IN A HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY? Hypocrites, art thou that protest too much and all these goody goody citizens out there are a bunch of hypocrites...they all talk the talk but don't walk.&&&4

A love of fish catches new friends, families - Hawaii News&&&Thank you for writing that Susan, good writing. One thing you remind me of, is that some things can change for the better. I get discouraged about life becoming so complicated, moving faster and getting more detached from the things that should matter. The internet, blogs, chat rooms, facebook etc. can be a good thing. Some might say it's not real. But it can be. Especially it can be good for handicapped and elderly people who have mobility problems. As far as you spending 'midlife' in a sail boat.... maybe more women should should sail around the Sea of Cortez by themselves through menopause! Oh, I know that wasn't very nice- I hope my wife doesn't read this one.(Now if someone was on board with you- I hope they were a Saint.)&&&2

If in fact he is elected just pull the plug and let the state sink....&&&50
Nash needs to go back to the dog days to be successful this sea...&&&I was willing to give Nash a chance to make Hawaii a winning team but after watching the BYU game, it's apparent that Nash is not ready for prime time. The entire team, coaches included played without intensity and passion. I've never, in all my years of watching UH basketball, seen a team give up. I guarantee you that Riley Wallace would have been in his team's face but Nash just sat there. No emotion, no nothing. I was embarrassed to watch the easy baskets and the lack of strategy. Unless he lights a fire under his team, I don't see Nash coming back next year. I think the decision to make him head coach was more an emotional one than a well thought out process.&&&1
Union workers protest Hyatt - Hawaii Business&&&how studid. another example of unions antagonizing and alienating their customers and guests at the hotel.

Palmer's the pick - Sports News&&&The timing of the Star Bulletin's All State picks is really bad and not thought out. How can you announce this before the OIA and ILH league All Stars are announced? This is ridiculous. The poll is also slanted towards the ILH and like the Star Bulletin Top Ten polls, off base. The Advertiser's top ten polls and All Star picks are more accurate.&&&2
Waikiki hotel could face closure - Hawaii News&&&Hawaii esp. Waikiki is becoming a COMMERCIAL DUMP and CONCRETE JUNGLE and the last vestiges of old Hawaiiana is slowly eroding away and HTA wonders why tourism is declining and or, will eventually decline where there will be no returnees because Waikiki has become the antithesis of what NOT to become in the tourism industry. There is no charm or local flavor left in Waikiki and all of Hawaii. Just superficial artifices with phony pretenses that will eventually compound the decline in Hawaii's tourism.&&&88

All's very well with Hawaii's healthy rank - Hawaii Editorials&&&How concerned would the state be about people who are overweight, if they did not pay for the cost that overweight people are more likely to incur? If everyone carried their own "weight" and paid for their own healthcare needs, then an overweight person would pay the price for their being overweight, wouldn't they? But when the state pays for their medical costs, what incentive, other than one that they themselves may have, do they have to shed those pounds? Are you helping them or hurting them by paying for their healthcare needs?&&&3
Hawaii Beat - Hawaii Sports&&&The lez-bows are so bad that they can't even have their own story. They have to put coverage of the lez-bows in the Hawaii Beat. At least the Star Bulletin has their priorities in order. They know not to waste resources on such a poor and terrible team. The only thing good about this team is Takahara-Dias is kind of pretty. They are horrible! The Wahine are known more for the amount of lez-bows in the stands wearing stupid looking t-shirts supporting their lez-bow gf's on the court, than winning ball games. Bolla was a tyrant, but at least he never lost by 46.&&&3

LOL. The incompetence is unbelievable. Cut this program, NOW. Use the funds to bolster education, not free bus rides. How many Furlough Fridays can $62 million buy back?

Welcome to the neighborhood | Liliha / Alewa - Hawaii Editorials&&&Please don't put in a restroom in Kunawai Park. Now that is it demolished there has been a decrease in the number of unsavory characters roaming the lane. There was illegal drug activity and illegal consumption of liquor before with the comfort station providing cover for the public who would cover the walls of the restrooms with ugly gang grafitti. I have lived on Kunawai Lane for years and it is safer now that the restroom is gone. No place to hide criminal activity!&&&3
DUI 'shame' Web site probably won't work - Columnists&&&I agree. Raise the taxes on any kind of liquor, beer, wine or the hard stuff.

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Wendy and Jim Hoglen of affluent Kalaheo, place before us a well written and articulate letter that displays an almost if not out right private school education. Lots of helpful pointing in the direction Hawaii should go, but no specific detailed solution as a to the destination we should arrive at. It is a generalized complaint with no definite spelling out as to exactly what to do. In other words, these two are against raiding the Rainy Day Fund but do not provide specific relief the State should seek. I can help them out. Let's gut the entire DOE, and fire each and every single one of the bloated DOE and their BOE, pencil-pushing, tuck in cheap aloha shirt and polyester pant wearing dweebs and dweebettes that drive cheap foreign import Toyotas, Mitsubishis, Nissans, Hyundai to their cubicle every morning.

Furlough case being hurried - Hawaii News&&&This sign from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals should motivate the State to remedy this Furlough Friday Failure that initially drew immediate criticism from across and throughout the United States, and from no less than Hawaii's own President Obama and his Cabinet, as well as International condemnation and shock. Only the most cold-blooded, heartless, selfish Hawaii citizen's, especially affluent or almost affluent private schooled parented brats, some of whom remarkably enjoy such elite private education paid for by HSTA union teacher parents who take public tax money in the form of salaries, to fund their little snotty brats education----at the same time encouraging 33% of public school students to fail! For those who advocate ignoring the plight of the less fortunate, especially the handicapped students, and stand idly by or applaud the State to continue to do nothing but give lip service, then if nothing is done about this, I hope the State of Hawaii goes broke and you all suffer the consequences of this economic downturn in every form imaginable. If the People of Hawaii want to be calloused and mean, while pretending to be polite, then why not we ALL be mean and rude to each other. This Furlough Friday Failure is an abysmal depiction of the selfish, sad state of sorry affairs in Hawaii today.&&&9

Why the furloughs? - Hawaii News&&&I remember public consensus was in favor of Governor Lingle's furlough plan. Now that everyone is feeling and seeing the consequences of no school, everyone is crying foul. Even the Governor is back tracking. But everything Lingle wanted she got. And she is now back tracking big time in light of all the public outcry. Wil Okabe, the HSTA's president, rightfully blast Lingle and calls her out: Unfortunately finger-pointing is becoming common practice for Lingle. And her list of gaffs are getting longer too. The Super Ferry and the Teacher Furlough stand out the most and looms the largest of all her blunders.&&&566

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"A lottery might help fund schools" Be very careful of lottery promises. I know of several states that promised 100% of lottery profits would go to education...and they are. The problem is any money from the lottery means that an equal amount does not come out of the general fund so the schools get no additional funds, they just come from a different source. A better solution...fix the way the school system works and reduce the costs rather than trying to figure out how to keep funding a losing poor system. A good start would be a meaningful audit of the current system, I think it would be a real eye opener to all taxpayers.&&&512

New mammogram advice finds a skeptical audience - Hawaii News&&&The only reason the US government is changing the guidelines now is so that once we have "public health care" they will be able to deny mamograms until age 50, just a cost saving measure.

Swine flu kills American Samoa child - Hawaii News&&&SWINE FLU KILLS AMERICAN SAMOA CHILD.. A 5-year-old boy flown here from American Samoa about a month ago for treatment of "---flulike illness died earlier this week of complications related to H1N1 influenza,---" said state epidemiologist Sarah Park. Other medical complications, had some underlying medical issues, contributing factors and now, flulike illness related to H1N1 influenza. Note: Headline to this story. Is it related or the actual cause? Which is it? Apparently, it's the complications, contributing or flulike symtoms that need to be evaluated. This may be the way to curtail this so called EPIDEMIC! I agree to getting the shots, but just like articles That recently made the news. What if the individuals of any age cannot nor able to recieve the said H1N1 shot? As with penicillin. What then? Could this what happened with this child? No accussation intended, but what if? We live in an age of fear and uncertainty. What assurances do we have other than what is being told to us. Something to think about .....&&&2
Moniz, Salas still uncertain - Hawaii Sports&&&I don't know. A lot of people think this weeks game is going to be a cake walk. If we're to win this one, it's super important for us to come out firing and build up a cushion. This team tends to get a little lackadaisical when they are ahead at the half and that means trouble. Tomey would like nothing better than to notch a win against us before he bows out at SJSU. His teams are traditionally feisty and play blistering defense. Again, this is a must win that we need keep our bowl hopes alive. JJ did his part, now it's up to us! This year's team can't look beyond one game at a time or they will fail! Hope that Bryant and Greg can play, but if they can't others need to step up and get this one for us. I would really like to see Mac concentrate more on the D and let Rolo do his thing. Go Warriors!&&&1
Court rules state failed on trust lands - Hawaii News&&&Dept. of Hawaiian Home Lands definitely dropped the ball and could have place more Hawaiians onto Hawaiian Homes land but I hope the court takes into consideration the ability of those suing to have actually qualified for a mortgage to build a home onto the land. If you are a taxi driver, a lei seller, a janitor, etc., you probably wouldn't have been able to qualify for a construction loan to build a house onto a lot. The State Tax Office should have copies of the plaintiffs' tax returns so it is possible to determine whether a person is able to qualify for a home mortgage.&&&90

Fallen Warriors earn praise of Marine peers - Hawaii News&&&There is no reason for brave Americans to be dying in Afghanistan. Can there be any question that there is a plethora of corrupt Afghanistan officials to arrest? The president's brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, reportedly on the CIA payroll, is also, as it's politely put in the press, a "suspected player in the country's booming illegal opium trade." Ahmad Rateb Popal, the president's cousin and another figure long linked to the drug trade, runs a local security company protecting American supply convoys that, according to Aram Roston of the Nation magazine, is involved in an industry-wide protection scam, using American Army money to pay off the Taliban not to attack. In addition, American arms and ammunition are clearly ending up in Taliban hands. The recent presidential election was a spectacle of fraud; the Afghan Army, despite years of training, may hardly exist (as Ann Jones reported for this site in September); the ill-paid, ill-trained Afghan police are known to operate on the principle of corruption; and a surprisingly small percentage of foreign reconstruction funds actually makes it out of the pockets of big private contractors and western specialists, as well as security firms, and into Afghan hands. Say no to a surge in Afghanistan - bring them home alive now. Mothers and Fathers, read the facts and take a stand before it is too late.&&&12
Wie should think about bringing the trophy home - Further Review&&&Now I know why you call this column Further Review. You generally make a strong statement, then when you find that you are wrong, you change your view. I think it would be more respectable to either stand your ground or to at least acknowledge you were wrong. By the way, are you trying to apologize to Michelle Wie? If you are, you might want to start off by saying "I'm sorry for calling you a choker, I was wrong." Then it wouldn't look so bad when you're trying to butter her up to get a tournament going in Hawaii.&&&1

Health risks and financial cost make it wise to quit smoking - ...&&&Whatever the "costs" are, is there a difference when that "cost" is born by the person who pays the price of smoking, and when that "cost" is born by someone other than the person who smoked? If the person who smoked had to pay for their own healthcare, and they smoked, and as a result had a serious medical problem, isn't that the ultimate price to pay for their wrong decisions? If they do not have to pay for their own healthcare needs, aren't they in effect being rewarded for doing the wrong thing? Should government refuse to pay for the medical care of people who smoke, or is that a discrimatory act that we should not aprove of? Would this questions even have to be asked, if government did not pay for our healthcare, and instead helped us to pay for our own healthcare needs?&&&11

Moanalua madness - Hawaii Sports&&&A lot of props to both teams.

I hope they have the same kind of success when they advance to the "real" football division--Div I. But as history has shown, that is highly doubtful. They'll get maybe one or, if the ball happens to bounce their way, two wins during their sojourn. Nevertheless, I wish any OIA football team the best of luck especially when the obvious favorite is Iolani (a so-called Div II team in the ILH).&&&3

Reactions to tipping commentary fast and furious - Letters&&&I once went to lunch with a coworker that would not tip, he said he gave his 10% to GOD so they can get it from him. I never went to lunch with this person again. I asked him how it that going to diapers on the waiter's children. Another incident, out drinking years ago, the guy did not want to tip the cocktail waitress. I asked why? He said,"Why should I, everyone else does." If everyone had his attitude they should not go out. I have waited tables before, it's hard putting up with some customers, we were paid less than min. wage and taxed like we made more because of tips. We had to tip out, the cocktail waitress, hostess, bus boys and the cooks. Maybe next time people will think be they stiff. Tipping mean to ensure prompt service, but you had to take in consideration, the amount of customers they have, and if the cook screws up it is not the wait staffs fault.&&&3

Does she think teachers are the only unit needed for the schools to function? She is trying to undo something that she was so adamantly in favor of only last month. And her comments about Duncan?

City moves windward site for green waste recycling - Columnists&&&Here's a question the city should answer if the Hawaiian Earth people don't call you back -- "Is the Hawaiian Earth location at Kapaa receiving green waste pickups now that more of the island has the automated green-waste pickups? If so, is that volume (per week, per month, however they measure) greater than the combined previous total of city pickups and homeowner dropoffs?" Seems to me this might be the only logical reason the Hawaiian Earth people would negotiate not getting more raw material. Either that or they were trying to cut back staff or costs that come with weighing the private vehicles and having them drive around within the dump site. Although it should be pointed out that Hawaiian Earth makes good money selling bulk compost to private customers who drive there and haul it away in their own trucks.(Which can be quite an experience.)&&&1

WEC, X-1, and Manny/Floyd | Hawaii Mixed Martial Arts | Honolul...&&&In regards to the odds on Mayweather-Pac fight, without a set fight date there is obviously not a lot of public betting going on right now and the big-time gamblers that have the type of money to move the odds fast are at work, which is why the odds went from 8-5 to 7-5 real quick. The smart money will be putting their money back on Pac big time once it drops to their liking. If you see the odds start swinging back the other way in a few days, if not quicker, then the smart money is already making its play. If not, you could see, it drop more. I say wait. Let fools rush in and watch the odds drop a little more. As a betting person, on this first fight, I would take Manny. And the odds favoring Manny is absolutely correct. Just look at the similar opponents both fighter faced and then look at who had the better results. And most importantly, look at who has the momentum right now. This is what the odds-makers are looking at beside public opinion. So of course Manny is favored. Any bets?&&&7

They get a kick out of watching it's head and gills gasp for air while it's tail section is eaten with chopsticks. Gotta luv the Chinese.&&&20
Time to build the bridge over state's fiscal chasm - Hawaii Edi...&&&Why not run an editorial about legalizing some form of gambling or an editorial about having the gambling referendum on the ballot? I am tired of listening to all these moral hypocritical idiots that are against gambling and then we have taxes, more taxes raised to the point where there will be a rebellion or there won't be any more monies to be taxed. A lot of these religious clerics that thou protest against gambling should have their status changed where they now can be taxed and lets see them continue their protests against gambling. WHY NOT A REFERENDUM ON GAMBLING AND LET THE PUBLIC VOTE?&&&51

Police chief search continues despite City Council's questions ...&&&It appears that under the leadership and direction of Ms. Camp the Honolulu Police Commission has become something of the a bad joke. First, its handling of the retention or more correctly, the firing of former Chief Correa. Now this fiasco. The ingredients of this disaster? Search committee members resigning, City Council conducting hearings, allegations of improper conduct between Ms. Camp and one of the candidates (recent Las Vegas meeting), and her Dam-the-Public full speed ahead attitude. Bottom Line: If the other members of the police commission don't step up I guess that says it all.&&&81

It would have been better for Senator Dan Inouye not to get involved with placing CPB ahead of other banks in receiving TARP funds and just let it go under. It would have saved taxpayers $135 million. If CPB went under, another bank would have taken over its accounts and taxpayers wouldn't have loss all that money.&&&21

Nice feel good thing to do but with the economy the way it is, is this really the time to do this? As far as the waste paint, it should be recycled. The city I live in now collects waste paint, mixes it all together, and gives it away to people of lesser means who need to paint their houses. Of course, the color may be kinda grey but it will protect the house!&&&3
Perfect ways to start and end a holiday meal - Hawaii Features&&&These 2 recipes sound so good! But Maui no more Tahini paste and no more Jell-O Pumpkin Spice pudding! Maui's food buyers are stuck in the 70's still, they all old men. They'll retire in another 10 years the hopefully we will see new products. I think that's why Whole Foods wanted to come to Maui cause they've seen our markets here and they just not moving forward.&&&2

It is pretty clear the voters did not want this and so had their say in the matter. It did not occur because one group had more money or more influence, it happened because the majority did not want it period....with 31 states saying the same thing it is pretty clear what the will of the people is. Live with it. Take note Hawaii and give up your "civil unions" quest....the voters here have already spoken on the issue.&&&111

Couture taking a back seat | Hawaii Mixed Martial Arts | Honolu...&&&Whatever the case, it shocks me to see Pacquiao as a 3:1 favorite in this fight. To me, Cotto’s wins over Joshua Clottey, Michael Jennings, Zab Judah and Mosley are much more impressive than Pacquiao knocking out an incredibly overrated Hatton and an old and aging De La Hoya. Wow great take on Boxing Billy.Kamakani Puu has always known that you had it in you to give a good boxing take.Manny has not only got the filipino fans but the world backing behind him.In all Kamakani Puu life time never thought there would be a day that a filipino fighter would attract this much attention and have so much fame.Its a pleasure to witness Pacman,Flash Elorde was a little before Kamakani Puu time. Pacman is the quicker fighter here and since Cotto cuts to easy this will be a tuff fight for Cotto.Cottos only chance will be to catch Manny with a big shot.Kamakani Puu sees it this way 7th 8th round cuts will be a factor and da Pacman should stop him.Here in Vegas they are talkin about the odds going off at 5-1 before the fight with all the pilipinos betting heavy on Pacman so Kamakani Puu is dropping a dime on Cotto just in case Cotto catches Pacman. AS for the UFC fight after Brock and Carwin fight got scratched who cares.......Thank you Dana for not putting this on PPV and molesting Nardo once again.&&&17

Business leaders believe rail will be beneficial - Hawaii Edito...&&&If they really believed in a railroad to solve our traffic problems, they would build it where the millions of visitors could use it, between the airport and the hotels in Waikiki. Maybe the taxicabs, buses, limos have a strong enough lobby to keep the politicians from replacing them with a train. It seems they are willing to let a handful of politicians get rich, at the expense of a never-ending debt that will fall to our grandchildren and their grandchildren.&&&63
Prudential offers aid to first-time buyers - Hawaii Business&&&Paul Bishop, NAR vice president of research: "[first-time buyers] absorb inventory, free existing owners to make a trade and stimulate related goods and services..." They also reward those realtors who bought in 2006-08 and who are stuck with properties they aimed to flip but couldn't as the market turned. Check out the disclosures of any properties you're interested in. Approx. 60 come up in my search, of which ~25 are owned by realtors! Most are listed well above what they were bought for, and have tiny if any price drops over hundreds of days on the market. Don't fall for the 'good time to buy'. Of course it is, you can catch their falling knife... These are the sellers not adjusting their prices down. Wonder why? It's almost like they're controlling the market!&&&10

Oh, by the way, UH is still ranked as one of the 20th Worse Football Teams in Div. 1 as of this week's rankings so if I was Coach Mack he should just shaddup and I'll wait till they play Navy. By the way, if Hawaii loses to San Jose this week, besides Tomey announcing his resignation, Coach Mack should be announcing his, also. Coach Mack saying his team is reaching its goals is a JOKE!&&&10
Hawaiian sugar going, going ... - Hawaii Editorials&&&Thanks for the memories. I spent time in the Spanish Camp, Puunene & in Wailuku from '51 -'53. I still recall the smell of the sugar cane when burning, those wonderful Turner Haulers, the speed bumps on the road to make sure that cars did not run into the path of a moving Hauler at the intersection. I recall walking past the mill in Puunene on the way to the movie theater. Those were the days.&&&13

Tour company president carries on a tradition - Travel&&&Tour company president carries on a tradition = Foreigner continues to foster un-sustainable practice of TOURISM - exploiting Hawai`i's natural environment. Cheryl Chee Tsutsumi, could you please write about someone that is NOT based on exposing & raping our natural resources by greedy PROFITEERS, like MAGGIE BROWN of LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA – that continue to destroy our “backyard” in the sole pursuit of more & more AMERICAN DOLLARS? You named your column Hawai`i's backyard - yet, you CHOOSE to write about a person and a business-model that is dependent on the trafficking of TOURISTS into a fragile eco-system - further polluting the visual, auditory & natural environment with their mere presence? My grandparents taught us to take care of the people and place that is our "backyard" – One day, hopefully we in Hawai`i can make better decisions to take care of our home - for EVERYONE - not just TOURISTS or those that can afford the $87.&&&3
Kaiser squeezes into the black for third quarter - Hawaii Business&&&This is a fine example of deception. Kaiser's little Hawaii outpost reports a $1M loss in Pacific Business News. Kaiser reports it eeked out a tiny profit in the Star Bulletin. On the mainland, Kaiser reports a $1.7B profit in the first 9 months of 2009. Kaiser claims to be a not-for-profit yet they reported $1.7B in PROFITS between January and Sept 2009, while many of their "customers" filed for bankruptcy. It's worth checking out Kaiser's IRS 990 (annual IRS filing) to see out how much charity care they provide under the IRS' definition. It's pitifully small. Last I checked it was less than 0.2% of their revenue. That said, Kaiser likes to slap their logo on everything in sight, so pays a lot to real not-for-profits sponsoring things such as Rose Bowl Parade and the LA Marathon (which is advertising).&&&8
Gartley forgotten - Hawaii Editorials&&&The problems at the UHM lies with the following: a) the administrators at Bachman Hall, "leaders" of the statewide system who are more interested in building new campuses, new programs,expand the university roles, etc. without knowing how to fund such added responsibilities. They do it to pad their dossier for the next high paid jobs, b) a board of regents who at best is superficially aware of the challenges of operating the university, impotent in advocating for the UH system in the community and the legislature, merely rubber stamping what Bachman wants and proposed, c) downtown-governor and legislature. There is too much interference into the UH operation; once a "resting place" for the old-spent politicians and political appointees. Like the people who filled Bachman, the legislature only know how to insist and build new campuses and programs without knowing where the next dollar to fund it adequately will come from. d) the community who really does not care if there is quality education in the state. They talk about education but refuse to play their part, especially when it comes funding. They are more ready to fund a football coach. They rich can continue to send their kids to the mainland. Hence, we continue the "plantation-missionary " mentality by creating distinct classes by education. Hawaii wants to break the sun-surf-party-laid back image but it refuses to invest in its future and image!&&&3

'Rain' fund raid right choice - Hawaii Editorials&&&When will the SB editorial board get one right. They missed again with this one. We need solutions as to why the DOE/BOE/HSTA triad absorbs so much of our state budget and produces such poor results, with or without furlough Fridays. Trim the fat in the education budget and you might just find enough to pay for furlough Fridays without raiding the rainy day fund. And when the rainy day fund is gone, it's gone and we will still have the same problem as before. We are a long way from fixing our budget woes so tossing $50 million more in the DOE abysss is only a stop gap solution at best.&&&28

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Commenting on the letter from William E. Mossman about DLNR. Sad to say Mossman is probably correct that DLNR will ignore public testimony. That has been their track record in the past. In most of the public hearings that DLNR conducts about rule changes, they are merely window dressing to decisions that have already been made. In this case, it goes beyond that though. Thielen is unhappy that her Renaissance plan was rejected by the legislature so she is retaliating with these new rules. It's time for the legislature to step in again and review DLNR in the whole. It's a run away agency with an ambitious leader and assault weapon toting stooges.&&&8

Are makeshift memorials legal? - Hawaii Features&&&We are having trouble with the perpetuation of these memorials which we wonder if the Clean Water Act would apply. How can just anyone use cement and along our shore line to affix plaques and fake flowers and flags? What if we all did it? Or more of us did it? We took the route of dedicated a bench in memorey of our loved one. It took just under $300, paperwork and approx. 8 months to do this via the city -- Today the bence sits there in loving memorey for all to enjoy and is not creating a safety issue of cement poured on the costline rocks with things sticking out. DLNR has no policy on better care of our resources? Need these items removed but have no staff to do it? No problem, some of who would like to respect our costline and keep it clear of visual blight and keep it safe can tend to it. I just hope we don't get arrested. Won't that be odd!&&&23

House collapses into rushing Kaipapau Stream - Hawaii News&&&Have to wonder at the initial decision to build any structure right on the earthen bank of a waterway that is prone to flooding; it's like building homes with wooden shingles and shakes in fire prone regions, or homes on oceanfront sand dunes in hurricane zones. The owners of homes that are destroyed by the natural events that their decision to build foolishly defied cannot expect others to foot the bill or accept responsibility when the inevitable occurs.&&&38

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Seitz is doing this case pro bono or for free, you freeloading moron. That was in our local as national and international papers, repeatedly, but you missed that and instead chose to display such ignorance in your letter. Essentially, Seigle is understandably frustrated by the Furlough Friday Failure, as all people of Hawaii (except maybe the snooty privileged snobs who send their brats to private school, enjoy leaching off our tax money to listen to the Honolulu Symphony and maybe enjoy wine tasting events traveling there in their foreign import Lexus, BMWs, Toyotas or Mitsubishis, etc.) that drew National criticism from Hawaii's own President Obama, as well as International Condemnation from throughout the World. But for Seiple to direct his hostility against lawyers in general and Seitz in particular, is a misdirected expression of his own failure to grasp this situation he thought warranted his stupid letter. If Seiple is to criticize ANY lawyer in this waste upon the next generation and our tax money, Seiple should look directly at the biggest obstacle that promoted this Furlough Friday Failure, Governor Lingle's lawyer, AG Bennett's office. THAT was a waste and will cost Seiple and the rest of us tax payers MORE than Seiple can add, and yet less than what he can comprehend.&&&17

With all the difficulties in place for scheduling non-conference opponents, this makes no sense for the WAC's responsibility to keep Hawaii high in the RPI and increase their exposure nationally. If this was the WACs idea, then Karl Benson may finally have to go as WAC commissioner. This is an inexcusable way to treat the best team in the league.&&&11
Repairing restroom roof at Sherwood's not easy - Hawaii News&&&What an outrageous estimate to repair the Sherwood's restroom roof. The structure seems to be so simple in design. Did the city get the roof tested for asbestos or did they assume it was asbestos? Would the cost be $100,000+ to replace the entire structure? Wow. As a follow-up question, would you post the final cost and scope of work done for this project?&&&15

Those responsible for this denial of service should be severely fined and their broadcast license renewals put under the microscope. There is a war against free, over-the-air TV. If you don't believe it, read this story: Hawaii lawmakers should not tolerate this attempt at "densensitizing" the public regarding its right to free access to broadcast radio and TV signals. The Obama FCC is letting down viewers in Hawaii. Let Washington know!&&&5

APEC coming to Hawaii - Hawaii News&&&McCartney said, it will show that Hawaii is a place to do business and is not just a vacation destination. Yes, true, maybe people from some of the countries can set up shop on the sidewalks in Waikiki. Sounds like the President says its OK to have conferences and conventions at one resort destination but can't have it at others. Glad to see Hawaii will have the opportunity to show itself to the rest of the world. It's too bad it is so unfriendly to business.&&&44

Only, one of them gets a team with a losing record and has a better record the second season, but the coach that inherited a winning team, only to have a losing season for two years in a row. Now that's a mystry. UH better start that interview for new coaches now before it's too late and they have to hire another looser in panic.&&&15

The mounting stress on soldiers in the endless war against Muslims waged by inept politicians is leading to the same unraveling situation as the mid-seventies. It's time for Commander Channon to get back in uniform.&&&3

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&If Gabriel Bailey is having such a hard time finding construction work, perhaps he should look to another trade. I'm sure there are construction projects going on but not enough to satisfy the over populated construction industry in Hawaii. That over populated industry needs to somehow be reduced. We cannot afford to continue creating "make work" projects such as rail. The second part of his letter seems to support Abercrombie's now dead idea to double the cost of the job by requiring that the pay be based on Hawaii's prevailing rate. The work is in Guam and the pay should be based on Guam's prevailing rate.&&&11

Judge rejects injunction bid, urges parties to settle suits - H...&&&The opinion rendered by visiting Granolafornia Judge Wallace Tashima, of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said himself, "I think frankly the plaintiffs are suffering irreparable harm." "I think this case should be resolved as quickly as possible because there's nothing you can do to bring back the Furlough Friday after it's gone by." That fork tongue opinion falls on its head with a "katonk." "The changes made here are not changes in the educational placement of any plaintiff," said Tashima. Oh yeah? Try telling that to the students when they are not in the "educational placement" of their school on those Fridays you just allowed the State, Lingle, DOE and the HSTA to cheat out of. That is just one stupid opinion. Just goes to show, you can live in an Ivory Tower, recognize the travesty below, and not lift a finger to do anything about it. The opinion by Tashima is worthless, does not remedy this atrocity and, in fact, encourages the State, DOE and HSTA to continue to callously collude to cheat their wards out of their education. Every single last one of the DOE, from Hamamoto on down, and every single one the 81% of the HSTA union member teachers should be FIRED. Lingle has just sealed the fate of Aiona in so far as he no longer having ANY chance of ever hoping of becoming our next Governor, as Aiona is now stained with himself too, idly standing by, and allowing this to happen. These people are going to PAY. Too bad Aiona is going to take the political hit for outgoing Lingle.&&&64

Strong news media depends on consumers taking a stand - Hawaii ...&&&All the news media is exactly the same. Every station carries the exact same news stories at the exact same time. If the news media wants to be successful they must be original and not follow each other on every single issue. There is no need to have so many stations if they all carry the same thing. In the end everything turns into mash potatoes and no one cares. As for as the challenges facing quality reporting in print, online and on radio and TV? I really don't see any challenges. For me I love print over reading things on the internet yet the bugs are not being worked out The internet should carry a basic outline of different stories and then if the reader likes it and wants more information then they must pay for it in text form. By doing this the internet would receive some paid advertisement and the magazines and text newspapers would also receive paid advertisement. No one wants to advertise on the internet when everything can be read for free and no one wants to advertise in text form when everyone can read anything they want free over the internet. These two media aspects go hand in hand. Anyway the news media knows that all ready yet they just want to float along in space following each other blindly.&&&10

Our employees and their families, friends and neighbors spend many hours in traffic to get to work or school." Then by all means ADDRESS THE PROBLEM, AND NOT TO IGNORE IT with Rail. Why the heck spend BILLIONS ignoring the problem when only MILLIONS IS NEEDED TO DIRECTLY SOLVE THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM.&&&5

He kaulike ko ka nuhou? - Kauakukalahale&&&"Synopsis: Media coverage of Hawaiians tends to ignore successful endeavors while highlighting those activities that perpetuate negative stereotypes." To the extent that statement is true, it is true because Hawaiian institutions inflict those stereotypes on Hawaiians in an effort to portray themselves as poor, downtrodden victims in need of huge gobs of money from the government. Kamehameha Schools has a very large research division whose main activity is to do data mining of Census Bureau statistics in order to prove that ethnic Hawaiians have the lowest income, highest levels of incarceration and drug abuse, worst victimhood for breast cancer and diabetes, etc. etc. etc. Then they send out press releases about it, and the newspapers dutifully publish articles about it. Gordon Pang, an Advertiser reporter, is one of the media shills for the Hawaiian victimhood grievance industry. One of his articles was so outrageous that I wrote a 30-page webpage rebutting some of the data and showing how stoooopid it was. See: "Forced assimilation may hurt Hawaiians" -- A typical combination of junk history and junk science fueling the Hawaiian grievance industry&&&2

HawTel bankruptcy plan OK'd - Hawaii Business&&&This is the 21st century. Telecommunications choices abound, and choices become available every day. If Hawaiian Telcom wants to remain a going concern, it will have to stop acting like a 20th century regulated monopoly. Stop the bean-counting. Stop the sloganeering. Stop the posturing. Stop the fixation on the landline. Adopt a culture of innovation. Embrace alternative technologies. Develop new services. Add features to existing services. Hawaiian Telcom has many local and national competitors that are eating its lunch. The number of competitors grows daily. Some of Hawaiian Telcom's toughest competitors are run by former Hawaiian Telcom employees or have key managers who are former Hawaiian Telcom employees. Some of these former Hawaiian Telcom employees, whose companies are exploiting Hawaiian Telcom's worst weaknesses, are people who, ironically, got laid off by Hawaiian Telcom's bean counters in years gone by, or they feared getting laid off, or they simply got fed up with the company's bean counting culture and moved on to greener pastures. The top three layers of Hawaiian Telcom's management is where the root of the problem lies. This is where the strategy is set and where the corporate culture starts. Everyone below those top three layers are just cogs in the machine. Until there is a paradigm shift in top management, the company will remain unpositioned for success.&&&9

All of the ferrets died. Please do your research before you decide. Follow the money regarding these vaccines. Did you know the pharmaceutical companies can NOT be sued if you or your child has an adverse effect?&&&3
BEWARE Ste 4000 Century Center&&&I made the mistake of renting a furnished room there and, although the landlord is threatening me if I get the word out, you should BEWARE of renting there. I cannot speak for ALL the rooms there but I can tell you that the one I had was situated in a part of the suite that is uninhabitable. I'm talking serious hygiene issues. I didn't see it when I visited - I was stressed looking for a place and needed something quick... I only lasted 5 days. I was already having physical symptoms after 2 days there. The same landlord actually showed me a ''room'' to rent (700 dollars) that was in their place of business (in Cent Ctr)- no ceiling, the size of a jail cell. I didn't rent that one. The one I rented was 1000 dollars. Incredible for the lack of maintenance/housekeeping that becomes obvious once you are there. And it all has to be paid in cash. The deposit, the rent... The day I left, another tenant was complaining of bedbugs... UGH.&&&4
Repairing restroom roof at Sherwood's not easy - Kokua Line&&&Ok, so it takes more time to get written bids to repair a beach restroom. But why does it take a whole year? Why does Lester Chang still have a job if he is this incompetent? Now he is going to take the rest of the month to decide on a course of action - something a normal person could probably decide in 30 minutes or less. If city managers are this inept then how on earth do we expect them to build a rail transit system? Hello?! Doesn't anyone else see the problem here? If the City of Honolulu can't even fix a beach restroom then how can we expect it to build a twenty mile long elevated rail line? And how does Mufi think he is qualified to be Governor if he can't get his managers to do their jobs?&&&6
Jim Tollefson - Hawaii Editorials&&&Gee. Aren't these the same guys who asked for the GE Tax to be raised for the train? The Chamber is only on board with the no tax pledge because times are tough. They know that businesses do not pay taxes; people (consumers) pay taxes and all a business has to do is pass on higher taxes or go out of business. Guess the economy tells them that passing on is not in the cards so now they have religion. My advice to the Chamber is to keep the anti tax religion and your customers will benefit.&&&4

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&RE: We must curtail insurance firms The impediment to adequate health care has been PROVEN to be a single payer govt. run health care system! Our cancer survival rates are much higher than any country on a govt. run system. We still try to save lives before trying to save a dollar. On a rationed care system, if it`s too expensive to save your life, if you`re deemed too old by some bureaucrat, not you or your doctor, you will be denied care. It`s simply cost efficient. The govt. will have a stranglehold on you and there won`t be anything you can do about it. NO THANK YOU! There are far better solutions to reforming health care than a govt. run system. My life is far too important to trust its well being to the govt. If you haven`t noticed, they`ve failed at just about every program they`ve put out there!&&&44

The East/Midwest portions of the mainland have too many alternatives, that are attractive from a price, and time spent in transit aspect to look at Hawaii... That said, when Cuba opens up again, sooner than later, Hawaii, will be in further trouble. Still, five hours from LA, with affordable air fare, sounds like a good short term target...

Study exaggerates jobs lost to China&&&Interesting that the editorial sites the Economic Policy Institute for this editorial. Here's a blurb from EPI's home page that says the opposite: "U.S.-China trade gap: Massive job losses for U.S. workers Unbalanced U.S. trade with China since 2001 has had a devastating effect on U.S. workers. This week's Economic Snapshot reveals that between 2001 and 2007, the trade deficit lost or displaced 2.3 million jobs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including 366,000 last year. As the nation's economic woes mount, a new EPI briefing paper, The China Trade Toll, details the devastating impact that the growing U.S. trade deficit with China is having on American jobs, wages, and key industries."&&&17

You, myself, and probably a large portion of Hawaii citizens have been saying this all along, but "IS ANYONE LISTENING?" It doesn't take an act of God to get this moving. All it takes is for the DOE/BOE to make it happen. Come on people, enough is enough. Remember DOE/BOE and HGEA, if you're not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem. And again for those citizens blaming the governor for the instructional furlough days, she didn't designate instructional days as furlough days, that was decided by the DOE/BOE.&&&4

On the other hand, many people are so fed up with Oceanic's incessant price increases, maybe they'll sign up for Hawaiian Telcom's TV service if it's significantly cheaper than Oceanic's.&&&11

Freddie Mac limits unchanged for 2010 - Hawaii Business&&&"Hawaii's real estate community is pushing for higher loan limits." Idiots. How many people are already in a mess because of that kind of help? The real estate community is not trying to help you buy a property because they want you to "get the home you deserve." They get a percentage of the sale, remember. And there's a good chance a 'licensed owner' has the property you're looking at, one they bought to flip in 2005-2008 but have been stuck with because they've insisted on asking a grossly inflated price through hundreds of days. Check the disclosures, tax history, and list price history of any properties you like. Write them down and see how many have licensed owners... They're busting to sell that (and probably their) property to you, and they're busting to keep prices up, or to have you believe 'now is the time to buy'. They don't want to lose money on their 'flip', of course. Sounds like a conflict of interest, at the very least.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Although switching to a generic drug seems sensible (though we must get it via mail from a Florida source), forcing state workers to change to a new drug is not a reasonable or health-conscious policy." Well Suzanne several MILLION people taking generic Zocor (myself included) would disagree with you. Both Zocor (even generic) and Lipitor are statins and BOTH do lower your cholesterol. The ONLY difference is cost. Since Lipitor has no generic they can charge through the wahoo for it and DO. The reason your doctor has you take it, all the perks he gets from the drug reps and no other. In my case (your mileage may vary of course) I actually went DOWN in my LDL count after switching from Lipitor to the generic Zocor with no other lifestyle changes. BTW, no one is FORCING you to switch, it is your choice to keep paying an obscene amount for a drug that basically does the same thing as a very much cheaper one....why should the taxpayers be saddled with YOUR expensive choice?&&&2

Butt Dust&&&Time out for a commercial... What Is Butt Dust?? What, you ask, is 'Butt dust'? Find out at the end, but read on and you'll discover the joy in it! These have to be original and genuine. No adult is this creative!! JACK (age 3) was watching his Mom breast-feeding his new baby sister... After a while he asked:'Mom why have you got two? Is one for hot and one for cold milk?' MELANIE (age 5) asked her Granny how old she was.. Granny replied she was so old she didn't remember any more. Melanie said,'If you don't remember you must look in the back of your panties. Mine say five to six.' STEVEN (age 3) hugged and kissed his Mom good night.'I love you so much that when you die I'm going to bury you outside my bedroom window.' BRITTANY (age 4) had an ear ache and wanted a pain killer. She tried in vain to take the lid off the bottle. Seeing her frustration, her Mom explained it was a child-proof cap and she'd have to open it for her. Eyes wide with wonder, the little girl asked:'How does it know it's me?' SUSAN (age 4) was drinking juice when she got the hiccups.'Please don't give me this juice again,' she said,'It makes my teeth cough..' DJ (age 4) stepped onto the bathroom scale and asked:'How much do I cost?' CLINTON (age 5) was in his bedroom looking worried When his Mom asked what was troubling him, he replied,'I don't know what'll happen with this bed when I get married. How will my wife fit in it?' MARC (age 4) was engrossed in a young couple that were hugging and kissing in a restaurant. Without taking his eyes off them, he asked his dad:'Why is he whispering in her mouth?' TAMMY(age 4) was with her mother when they met an elderly, rather wrinkled woman her Mom knew. Tammy looked at her for a while and then asked,'Why doesn't your skin fit your face?' JAMES (age 4)was listening to a Bible story. His dad read:'The man named Lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city but his wife looked back and was turned to salt.' Concerned, James asked:'What happened to the flea?' The Sermon I think this Mom will never forget .... This particular Sunday sermon....'Dear Lord,' the minister began, with arms extended toward heaven and a rapturous look on his upturned face.'Without you, we are but dust...' He would have continued but at that moment my very obedient daughter who was listening leaned over to me and asked quite audibly in her shrill little four year old girl voice,'Mom, what is butt dust?' Make sure you pass this one on and spread the smiles...&&&1

October foreclosure rate rises - Hawaii Business&&&Newspapers earn money from advertising placed by realtors, lenders, and mortgage brokers, so papers are pressured by that money to publish the real estate industry's unrealistic forecasts. Worse, realtors have a near-monopoly on sale price information, and newspaper reporters never ask realtors hard questions like "how do we know you're not lying about those prices?" The result is an endless stream of stories reporting that the National Association of Realtors (NAR) says it's a good time to buy. Asking the NAR about housing is like walking into a used car dealership and asking the salesman if today would be a good day to buy a car. More on&&&18

Oahu families are going to grow, as will the island's population and so, presumably, will the number of automobiles. Billions will be spent on road and highway improvements (other documents attest to this), and rail will be the alternative. Just build it.&&&76

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&RE: Give folks more to health care This bill is more than insane: It slashes more than $400 billion to Medicare and $170 billion to Medicare Advantage, while imposing taxes on medical devices. How can this be good for senior citizens?! Since it will be underpaying medical providers, they, in turn, will jack up their rates to patients with private insurers, FORCING more people onto the public option! It `grandfathers` out of existence individual health care coverage. The bill contains NO BAN on federal promotion of assisted suicides and/or health care rationing of treatment! I want to decide MY health care with MY doctor, not have some DC bureaucrat, whose job it is to cut costs, deciding MY treatment! We currently have the highest cancer survival rates because we can get treatment when we need it, unlike in the UK where you are on a wait list. I don`t want to wait in line to get rationed care. Watch our cancer survival rates drop. Why did Congress exempt itself from being on the public option? Because they know it stinks! One of my favorites: It PROHIBITS states from using tort reform to lower health care costs!! Why, when doctors say this would be a MAJOR cost reducer?! Isn`t that the goal?! I guess not. This is not about health care reform but a power grab by the govt. who wants to control everything. And, amazingly, they are COMPLETELY ignoring the people and following their agenda. This is too important to be rushed through. This is your life! Guaranteed choice means NO PUBLIC OPTION!&&&31

Gentry, Kamehameha end residential pact - Hawaii Business&&&For all those who LOVE our Aina, and who truly desire to protect our open spaces--this is Great News! Not only that, it now provides fuel in the form of HOPE, that the rail planned to destroy the last open space upon the Ewa Plain----can, and WILL be stopped. The collapse between KSBE and Gentrys' agreement, halting that planned development, as applied to the other greedy developer Horton, who with mufi, wants to plaster over the last Open Space upon the Ewa Plain,(as part of a premeditated plan to enrich themselves and mufi's campaign coffers, by destroying the most highly productive and valuable Agricultural land on Oahu) lets us ALL know that we can put a stop to this madness---one way or another. Folks may have forgotten that when you destroy Open Space, you are going to raise temperatures as well. No greenery to remediate temperature. Just asphalt making it HOTTER than it is now out in Ewa. You all call it Global Warming, or recently the fad is "climate change" because that is unarguable and easier to "prove." But, I digress. The point here is ALL should join to defeat mufis rail road job on us. Over developmemt and the cluttering, congesting and compacting of human beings as just a source of bleeding taxes from the People, in order to benefit and enrich the powerful politically connected---by selling us shibai about "mass transit," can and WILL be halted. From the Granola Eaters, to our respected Elders, and all folks in between---join up. Part of mufi's plan counts on beating the masses into submission, and explains the over inundation and saturation of pro rail propaganda. Quite frankly, I did not care one way or the other at the beginning of all this rail stuff. But after seeing the bullying tactics of mufi and his hench and yes men, and the outrageous awarding of YOUR monies to HIS cronies, I decided to oppose this rail project and do every small thing I could do to stop this over development and fleecing of YOU tax payers. I looked at the .5% GE tax too. That is also putting down pressure on our deflating economy. Yeah, only .5%, big deal? Sure is when 800,000 people are being pumped out of this on Oahu, and the outerislands get hit too in the form of hidden inflated costs when their goods and services transit through Honolulu. In other words ALL HAWAII is suffering from this extra tax to enrich mufis hacks. Maybe rail once is a good idea. But not mufis scheme. Let's stop overdevelopment!&&&12

Muslim Trojan Horses&&&Fort Hood shooter was member of Homeland Security Panel advising Obama Of course. Why not? He was a "moderate." Until he wasn't. "Nidal Hasan: Ft. Hood Shooter Participated in Homeland Security Disaster Preparation," from Gawker, November 6 (thanks to Mary Belle): The gunman who killed 12 people today at Ft. Hood appears, based on current media reports, to be Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan who was listed as a participant in a Homeland Security Policy Institute's presidential transition task force last year. The task force was not officially affiliated with the White House. It was a project of the Homeland Security Policy Institute, an independent thinktank housed at George Washington University, aimed at drafting policy recommendations for the incoming Obama administration. According to the task force's May 2009 report [pdf], a "Nidal Hasan" from the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine was a task force event participant. Other participants included Senate and House staffers, Department of Homeland Security officials, Defense Department officials, and reporters for Politico, the Washington Post, and the London Times....

Account points to a second officer as the true hero at Fort Hoo...&&&I saw a TV interview of Sgt. Todd and it seemed like he was either told not to say he was the guy who shot Hasan or he was just being modest. I hope the doctors didn't discard all the bullets that they removed from Hasan and ballistic testing of the bullets can be done. The people who released the story about Sgt. Kimberley Munley may end up with egg on their face. I can see why they wouldn't want the truth to come out. This eyewitness account sounds more creditable than what has been reported in the news so far. This all fits in with what Sgt. Munley asked, "Did anyone die?". If she was in a gunfight with the shooter, she would be asking, "Did I get that guy?" or "Did I stop that guy?" Someone should check her weapon to see how many rounds she got off. If she got off two or three rounds, it would mean that Sgt. Todd stopped Hasan since he supposed was shot four times. The officer who shot Hasan last is the one who stopped him.&&&5

Resolve homelands issue - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mahalo, Star Bulletin. Your column sets out a few points regarding the history behind the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA), 1920, but omits key historical events leading up to its passage. Under the Kingdom of Hawaii, at the time of the Mahele of 1848, three (3) parties were identified as holding an interest in the formerly undivided communal lands. 1) Kamehameha III; 2) the Chiefs and Konohiki; and, 3) the native tenants, which also included the defeated alii, dispossessed alii and disinherited alii who, without land, were treated as common native Hawaiian tenants. Under the Mahele of 1848, Kam III received his share, the 245 Chiefs and Konohiki received their share, but the native tenants did not receive one acre and were cheated out of their one-third share by the Kingdom of Hawaii. The reason behind this was that the greedy Chiefs and Konohiki, with approval of Kam III, wanted to insure the common native Hawaiian tenants would be ingratiated toward the Chiefs and Konohiki in a formula that included impoverishing the common native tenants, and throwing out morsels of "benefits" or "gratuities" to the native tenants, in order to continue to keep this class subservient and obedient. That is the hisory behind these "Alii Trusts" as well today. As one Chief said at the time, "If we give them their land, what use would they have of us?" After cheating the native tenants in 1848, two years later, in 1850, and then only as an afterthought, did the Kingdom pretend to want to deliver lands to the native tenants under the Kuleana Land Grant Acts of 1850-54. Evidence of its design to fail is found that out of the 33.33% of the lands that were supposed to go to native tenants, the Kingdom only delivered .8 percent to the native tenants. Driven off their ancestral lands, into the urban core and centers of Hilo, Lahaina and Honolulu, for example, the native tenants were left impoverished, destitute and in a condition of homeless vagrants in their own homeland by the Kingdom of Hawaii. So abysmal were their condition, the United States in 1920, looked at the situation, found the root cause linking the Mahele of 1848 to the native tenant condition, and were so moved to enact the HHCA, 1920. That instrument is now contained in a federal-state compact in Section 4, and the funding mechanism to implement the HHCA and in Section 5(f), of the Hawaii Statehood Admission Act, 1959. Those who desire to return to the foreign, european-import concept of the "monarchy," are often quite ignorant of what great harm the corrupt Kingdom of Hawaii did to the native tenants and their heirs. OHA advances a form of "restore the monarchy" effort, "if not, give us cash," and their Akaka Bill is based on milking the United States tax payers regarding the overthrow of that corrupt monarchy in 1893, but using the native tenants heirs share of 5(f), to do so. The cruel irony is that 5(f) was placed there to fund the HHCA beneficiaries and remediate their condition suffered as a result of the corrupt monarchy having cheated them out of their share. To have a State agency, OHA, use the 5(f) monies to pay lobbyists and p.r. people to seek passage of legislation to invent a fake Indian tribe under the Akaka bill, and try to take over the HHCA and 5(f) lands too, is absolutely unbelievable. The Kingdom of Hawaii was corrupt to the core. The native Hawaian tenants Section 4 HHCA, and 5(f) share, SHOULD NOT be used to advocate restoration of any form of the Kingdom, neither under the Akaka bill, nor any of these vaious "sovereignty groups" that have sprouted up, many led by frauds, felons and con-artists.&&&75

Captain Thompson, for now - Hawaii Sports&&&Top Ten Other Captains Linked to UH Men's Basketball 10. Captain Joe Hazelwood: If you thought the Exxon Valdez was a disaster just wait until the WAC season starts 9. Captain William Bligh: few people know his second mate on the HMS Bounty was named "Kareem Nitoto" 8. Captain Hook: that tick-tock sound you hear is the clock running out on Bob Nash 7. Captain Kirk: he boldly goes where no UH guard dares - to the basket! 6. Captain Ahab: spent all his time pursuing a white whale when what he really needed was a 7-footer who can score in the paint 5. Captain Crunch: appears on the cover of a cereal box - which is one place you will never see any UH ballers 4. Captain And Tenille: We'd like to forget him as much as we'd like to forget last season 3. Captain Kangaroo: he has more hops than anyone on the UH basketball team 2. Captain Underpants: the hero of a series of children's books, he's all you have left after another game in which you lost your shorts 1.

Good noodles needed for excellent fried saimin - Hawaii Features&&&For an unhealthy treat, I like fried dried saimin. Boil dried saimin (not refrigerated or frozen) in 1 cup water and the seasoning pack for 1 minute so noodles soften and separate. Drain. In nonstick pan, fry over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes with magarine and/or oil. You can reduce salt by using less of the packet, and reduce the oil by frying until drier.&&&2
18 on-the-job deaths in isles last year - Hawaii News&&&Why would anyone be surprised with these statistics today. It's been 'open season" on the average worker in America since 1975 according to a study at NYU's Brennan School of Law. Since 1975 the Dept. of Labor has had a lackluster track record of investigating employers and enforcement of our labor laws. If you factor in the fact that successive Presidential administrations have kept the DOL under funded and understaffed for decades they are all but nonexistant. Also if you examine the current trend of lobbying members of Congress [and our local politicians as well], corporations can just about do as they please these days without fear of prosecution or accountability. In Hawaii we also suffer because of our "post-plantation", at will labor laws which give most employers carte blanche. Think about filing a "complaint" with the DOL Wage & Hour Division? Don't waste your time. When I did such in March 2005 against a local hospital here they stalled me for a year, told me "my case would cost too much"and refused to include testimony & evidence in my favor. Later when I requested "all the documents that COULD be released to me" under the FOIA, I learned many interesting facts. They said the employer was guilty of violating a federal labor law [Family & Medical Leave Act of 1993 in 2005] but - they conducted a "limited investigation". In middle of my case the Case ID number changed suspiciously on DOL documents sent to me. They also never explained why this employer committed fraud for 12 years by displaying DOL rights posters in the workplace but told its employees they would lose their positions if they applied for FMLA leave. The end result of my complaint? The employer got off without penalty and I got blackballed in my occupation for being courageous enough to attempt to hold the employer accountable. No doubt the employer had a good laugh when their bad behavior was rewarded and the DOL buried their crime and threw me under the bus.&&&1

KHON's Veneri ready to go behind the scenes - Hawaii Sports&&&Interesting comment by Coach Mack about trying to make the opponent one-dimensional. Hawaii's offense, either by design or choice, is already a one-dimensional offense with total emphasis on the pass. Let's see, the creed is "Pass to set-up the run." Problem is when the opponent stops the pass, Hawaii has not demonstrated it can execute the run. This past game against Utah St. was an anomaly. Or is this a sign for a change in philosophy?&&&2

If you check out the Honolulu Zoo street level view, you can even find the Gorilla cage and find the mayor and his little band of chimps working on their railroad. But the Washington, DC street level view is the most awesomest!

Leave tax policy alone - Hawaii Editorials&&&Folks don't recognize that the weak dollar is causing prices for everything to increase recently. Notice gas prices, food prices, staple prices, etc. are all up by 10 to 20% or more. Many shoppers will suffer even more if the GE tax is increased by even 1/2%. If gasoline prices increase even more before the end of this year, everything will keep increasing in price. This is like a tax and is the cost of all the borrowing and spending by the Feds.&&&20

Marine tosses dog from cliff on YouTube&&&I think this man should be dishonorably discharged and convicted of animal cruelty. The pup is NOT dead, or fake, and the fact that this "Marine" chose to throw him off a cliff shows the lack of compassion and utter disregard for life he has. He'll be the one to kill children upon returning home, or rape someone, while his buddy watches and says, "that was mean". The marine, though he doesn't deserve that title, deserves to be in jail for animal cruelty and have extensive psychiatric evaluations done on him.&&&7
Baby's death blamed on delay&&&It has been over one year after this tragic incident. The public does not know what happened after the loss of this innocent baby's life all in the name of national security. President Bush established Homeland Security and the Patriot Act in good faith to protect the security of our country. However, TSA and Immigrations & Customs are only looking for enemies within its citizens--finding fault in every war-weary Americans. Is this Nazi Germany? Homeland Security uses the media to sing their empty victories just to justify their existence, but how much did they do for our country besides creating a conjestion in airports and seaports and arousing unnecessary distrusts in Americans? How about the helpless lady spilling water on the floor and the TSA agent making her wipe it up? Homeland Security, the Patriot Act, and TSA all should be disbanded. They are painting a very dirty picture of America! The paranoia starts when we start pointing fingers at our own citizens. Mr. Obama please end this madness now because the Patriot Act is like a 2nd rate henchmen wearing a swatiska on its inflated chest.&&&7

City awards first rail contract - Hawaii News&&&I wish Honolulu the best on the rail. Only speaking from a 4 time tourist on Oahu, Oahu is a small island...25 miles wide and 30 miles long...and full of concret and buildings. I just can't figure out what possible good the rail system will do other than take more businesses and land. We think Oahu has a great transportation system. Maybe the Oahu government should go to Molokai or Kauai to see how a tropical island is. We always base in Oahu as hotels are cheap, Mailie Sky Court, but Oahu is the last place we would move to. TOO many people, traffic, etc. IN FACT...Oahu should make their TOP PRIORITY...restoring the beaches around Waikiki and Kuhio. We look at current pictures are are appalled, the beaches are almost gone. THATS WHAT TOURIST COME FOR. A tropical island with beautiful beaches. A huge Aloha rom Northeast PA.&&&331

And why is gore SO AFRAID TO DEBATE THE "global warming" ISSUE WITH SCIENTIST AND INDIVIDUALS WHO CHALLENGE him??? It's because he cannot back up his position.&&&33

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&In response to Isaiah Lee Chong -- yes, let's have residents contact their City Council member in direct proportion to public sentiment in each district, which is decidedly pro-rail. A strong majority of residents in each Council district believes rail is a good investment for Oahu; the lowest percentage among the districts is 60. That's a landslide of pro-rail opinion in our community. With respect to Mr. Chong's views, if TheBus and TheCab were meeting residents' needs, there'd be no traffic congestion on the H-1, right? Nobody would be driving in that mess if taking the bus or a taxi were all that's required. Maybe Mr. Chong is fine with 90-minute or two-hour commutes, morning and night, but the people already have spoken. They want to Build Rail Now!&&&110

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Building a railroad just to provide jobs during this recession is very shortsighted. The jobs will be good, but they will be gone when the railroad is built, and those left unemployed will have to find ways to pay to maintain and operate that railroad since surveys show that no one wants to give up their cars and no one plans to ride the train. If we want to create new jobs, let's convert the former sugar cane and pineapple lands to truck farms and employ our people in providing us with all the vegetables, etc. that we now have to import. That's thinking ahead.&&&14

After years of growing tensions, 7 minutes of bloodshed - Hawai...&&&No sympathy here. His parents were Muslim, but opened "a seedy bar"? He went to OCS in 1997, after Operation Desert Storm. The American taxpayers paid for his medical school, internship and residency; then, he decides he wants to quit, but doesn't want to pay the money back? "...if you are killed in the military fighting Muslims, you are going to hell." Give me a break. This guy's a psychiatrist. He's a REMF (the first two letters stand for Rear Echelon, figure out the last two). Many disagree with the war for various reasons. Mine is Bush and Cheney lost focus and BO has not found it. Bin Laden, Al Queda and the Taliban are responsible for 9/11. The mission is to find them and destroy them and whoever helps them wherever they are, not rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet, disagreement does not entitle people in the military to choose which wars they want to fight and to take a time out when they disagree. So, his answer to his problems is to shoot US soldiers? They should court martial him, and shoot or hang him.&&&5

My kids play on a traveling soccer team, almost every weekend I am away from the house from dawn to dusk, not to mention the tournament weekends. I don't starve, but I do watch what I eat and take everything in moderation. I have learned which places are my friend and which are not. Funny things is, I can count on eating less carbs at KFC than subway. and Subway is considered Healthier.&&&2

UH won in trenches - Hawaii Sports&&&A win is a win even if it was two crummy teams playing one another. Playing against a team of comparable talent, Hawaii is shoddy at best and crummy at worse. Don't get me wrong. I am elated with the victory but they must realize that their goal is to beat a team with a winning record. Geezus, Hawaii losing to Idaho....come on coaches....give me a break. Despite the criticism I will take, Hawaii needs to beat a team with a winning record and so, Hawaii beating a New Mexico State or San Jose, I am not going to get too excited. Now with Navy & Wisconsin coming in, let's see how Hawaii will fare at that level but like I said earlier, A WIN IS A WIN.&&&10

Danger signs emerged before Army rampage - Hawaii Editorials&&&Look ... the pervasive violence that spills throughout our culture makes one wonder why more of these rampages do not happen rather than why do those we have had to endure. During Vietnam it was not uncommon for soldiers to kill ("frag") officers deemed too gung ho. The military system trains killers, exports killers, debriefs killers, and either redeploys them or releases them and recruits others to do this filthy work. Charles Whitman of Texas Tower infamy and Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed JFK, were both Marine sharpshooters. Secondary PTSD may have had a part to play in this recent rampage, as the shooter seems to have counseled soldiers with serious mental damage from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. You get what you pay for. You want war without end ... you got it.&&&50

This egregious, outrageous, short-changing of Hawaii's future leaders and their basic education, thinly disguised as "Furlough Fridays" is absolutely unbelievable and unconscionable. For our elected officials, BOE, their DOE and the shameless 81% of the HSTA voting members to agree and collude in this, each looking the other way, deserves the full, unbridled wrath of the visiting US Court of Appeals Judge deciding the fate of our future leaders. In the priority of things in life, the selfish, self-serving, egotists in elected office have now dropped down to last place. Every elected official, from Lingle on down, deserves to be treated with outright hostility, derision and every form of disrespect allowed under the law, for allowing this to occur.&&&37

Vegas shooting devastates family&&&Hello, I would like to leave my thoughts on this matter. I knew this family pretty well after living in #222 for several years. I moved 6 months ago but had lots of time there at Sonterra apt. I would have never thought this could happen to this family. They seemed so very happy when ever I saw them. The Mother was very protective of her son. The boy was always with his father and seemed happy as could be. The boy is my real concern as he was very attached to the both of them. I just can't figure out why this happened. It sickens me to think he killed his wife while the son was in the home. This will affect his every walk of life from here on out. What a smart boy I might add. I just hope he was able to go with his Grandparents and not the State. As for the father I can't understand why he would have done this and hope that the media keeps us posted as to why this happened.&&&41

Hold on to that weapon there leon spinks and get off the ganja or someone is going to get hurt or killed by your failure. Take some martial arts or something, geez.&&&2

It's not too late to cut tax liability - Hawaii Business&&&"The Stimulus Act provided eligible individuals a refundable income tax credit for 2009 and 2010." "The credit for the tax year 2009 is up to a maximum of $400 ($800 for joint filers) and phases out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income beginning at $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers)." I'm still not sure how a taxpayer is suppose to figure out just how much he received during 2009 since individuals were suppose to receive about $7 plus more in their paychecks per week. Will the employer have a separate amount on the 2009 W-2 form stating your taxable income is this amount and "X" amount represents the $7 plus tax credit that began on or about April or 2009? Does anyone know how this will be handled by the employer? It would have been easier if the Treasury Department had just sent us a check for the $400.&&&1

The wonders of New Zealand - Travel&&&We made this same trip 5 yrs ago. Not bad, but riding on a bus touring the south island is awful. The glacier is wimpy.

UH's Lee lifts Hawaii's spirit - Hawaii Sports&&&A really feel-good story about an exceptional individual, student, athlete, and person who exemplifies tremendous character, determination, perseverance, resilience, and one who is definitely dedicated in her faith and beliefs which also demonstrates the high values she holds for herself and others around her. This is the type of person that deserves every accolade and publicity and is a tremendous inspiration to all, boys and girls, that if they dedicate themselves, they can do anything. If she passes the Medical College Admissions Test, I hope and would wish that she receives scholarships to cover her graduate education in medical school as she will be an excellent contributor to our community and mentor to girls aspiring to fulfill their dreams. Wishing Jayme the very best as she moves on in her future.&&&1

My concern now, is I'm ready to retire next year and locality pay will be transitioned within the next three years. I'm hoping it can be included at 100% for those ready to retire so we don't have to hold off our retirement an additional two-three years for our high three. I'm sure someone will take this into consideration.&&&23

Education and social programs have nothing to do with the "Aloha Spirit". Money doesn't grow on trees! Hawaii's taxes are high as it is. How much more do you think people should pay? The education problem is because of the DOE and it's bloated amount of non teaching personnel. If you want to give money to the state, mail a check to it. Then they'll hire more public employees.&&&9

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&I noticed a letter to the editor saying that Hawaii citizens are not interested in what happens in New Jersey or Virginia where the GOP won. Hawaii is all Democrats in the State Legislature....and they spent all the money. On the Mainland the Democrats are in trouble because of big spending ...but not in Hawaii. Mufi will easily roll into the Governors chair and RAIL will be financed by money that does not exist...which doesnt matter to Obamanomics. Rail is a good idea but is a financial disaster so legal hotel gaming will be introduced in 2011 to pay for it. There is no other answer except to keep kidding yourself that tourism will rebound next year.&&&61

Wake Up America !&&&The recent indictment and arrest of Aurora resident and Afghanistan immigrant Najibullah Zazi on terrorism charges has again put a spotlight on the problem of Islamic radicals plotting acts of violence. But a book released this past week raises the question of whether our nation's response to the terrorist threat is being deliberately undermined by U.S.-based organizations whose mission is the eventual Islamization of America. "Muslim Mafia: Inside the Secret Underworld that's Conspiring to Islamize America," was released Oct. 15 and is already gaining attention from national lawmakers. Four members of Congress have asked the House sergeant-at-arms to investigate allegations in the book of double agents placed inside Congress by the Council for American-Islamic Relations. Such allegations will be dismissed as alarmist by many, but critics will have to confront the book's extensive documentation. Its authors are investigative reporters David Gaubatz and Paul Sperry, who have national security backgrounds and solid reputations. The most controversial part of the book is the relationship between CAIR and the international Muslim Brotherhood, a relationship that has both financial and ideological aspects. The Muslim Brotherhood is highly organized and operates in both public and covert realms. One of its avowed missions is to bring Sharia law to America as one step in the destruction of Western civilization from within.&&&3

Water main repair to snarl Ala Wai for another day - Hawaii News&&&I don't understand where HPD is in the control of traffic. People entering the Ala Wai from Kapahulu should've been warned of this water main break. Kuhio avenue was a parking lot all day with no officers present to help move traffic. The need to have University avenue extended to Waikiki with a bridge over the Ala Wai canal has been a issue for a long time. If we had a real emergency and had to move all the people out of Waikiki we would be screwed. The mayor is concentrating his time on light rail when we have so many things that have to be done with what we have.&&&11

Kamehameha rolls - Sports News&&&If there are going to be changes made in the Crusader football program, they need to be made very soon. Don't wait till summer. Give the next coach an opportunity to get his staff together this year. A coaching staff that has discipline, control and respect of the student athletes. A new OC and DC is definatly needed. We have an alumn that runs the best high school offense in the state. Two as a matter of fact when you consider the DII level. On defense, what has happened to the most feared attacking base defense of years past. The staff this year often looked so confused and in disaray. I guess that is why we have the same problem of a defensive nose guard continuously jumping offsides and incurring personal fouls through out the season. Acceptable in the first game, not through the last. The offense still does not want a traditional running game, and they have all but eliminated the tight end position. The offensive linemen deserve to learn more than just pass blocking. This offensive gimmick offense needs to be complimented with a power running game. The AD has instilled a proper and respectable philosophy to the student athletes. They deserve more from their coaches.&&&12

Home sales on Big Island and Kauai rose in October - Hawaii Bus...&&&Falling House Prices Are The Solution, Not The Problem House prices will keep falling in most places because those prices are still dangerously high compared to incomes and rents. Banks say a safe mortgage is a maximum of 3 times the buyer's yearly income with 20% downpayment. Landlords say a safe price is a maximum of 15 times the house's yearly rent. Yet on the coasts, both those safety rules are still being violated. Buyers are still borrowing 6 times their income and putting only 3% down, and sellers are still asking 30 times annual rent, even after recent price declines. Renting is a cash business that reflects what people can really pay based on their salary, not how much they can borrow. Salaries and rents prove that prices will keep falling for a long time. Anyone who bought a "bargain" this time last year is already sitting on a very painful loss. More on&&&2

Hawaii's class time thin even before cuts - Hawaii News&&&Let's see the data on how many DOE teachers and administrators send their own children to private schools. Lacking an investment in the quality of education children receive in the public schools because they are not part of the community, these teachers/administrators will then seek to minimize their efforts and time spent working. It is no mystery why the teachers bailed out on instructional days rather than "development" or "professional" days, it is a way to meet the furlough mandate with the least labor; they can still attend lots of days when the kids are not there and receive full pay. The public schools in Hawaii function mainly as social control agencies and have a minimal role as educational ones. Lowest math and reading scores among the states and now the fewest instructional hours/days. No wonder the streets abound with slippah-slapping, big gulp-sucking, obese, ignorant kids.&&&115

I love what they did and hope others in the neighborhood follow this example. Don't copy Mainland type mansions.&&&26

He wants to be a good neighbor, so he shared his dreams n' plans for more housing on his 4.2 acres and is willin' to talk story via his e-mail. I think he said he has a $26,000 monthly mortgage...anyone else have a take on this meeting?&&&2
Bragging rights - Hawaii Sports&&&BYUH is a great team, but it's sad that there's even the question of who the best team on the island is. Look, if a DII school can recruit better players than a DI school something is very wrong. Also, with all of the injuries occurring in practice....you have to wonder if they're due to the way Nash runs his practices. This is the beginning of the year and everybody is all banged up already. Injuries have a higher probability of occurence when players are fatigued. I know players need to be conditioned during practice, but you shouldn't run them ragged either. At this level, they should already be in game shape condition at the first day of practice from offseason conditioning.&&&1

Newswatch - Newswatch&&&I can't believe the light sentences that judges in Hawai'i mete out to habitual offenders. The Big Island man had 14 CONVICTIONS plus a laundry list of other offences. No wonder the state has such a pervasive problem with drugs, drunk driving, and antisocial behavior. There are no real consequences for illegal actions.&&&1
Kamehameha primed - Hawaii Sports&&&Would Stant be interested in coming to Damien?? The present coaches at Damien has made a mockery of the school's program and bringing in Stant and his assistants would return Damien to respectability. Of course, its not all about winning but its HOW one loses that accounts for the measure of a program.&&&9
Rain expected to go away today - Hawaii News&&&Every time we see on top the t.v. the Board of Water Supply telling us for "conserve water" and "no let the shower run" and "no wash your foreign import car in the hot sun" and "change your toilet settings to super-save." But, when God Blesses Hawaii with rain, the first thing the media, catering to the affluent interest of couch comforters, come here and tell us the rain going stop so you all can go back to your mundane lives of showing off your material possessions in the sun. When the Rain comes, it should be time for Celebration for the reason God keeps the grass is green. (No, not THAT kine, hippies.)&&&3

Honey jars in carry-ons meet a not-so-sweet end - Hawaii News&&&Why can't places like Zippy's, McDonald's, Times Super Market, Safeway and others produce and sell diabetic-approved breakfast, lunch and dinner items so that diabetic people can buy prepared food to eat? They are restricted in their diet and need professional help to make foods they can eat and enjoy. All of us diabetics would appreciate it!-- Richard Ummm, if you lived a somewhat healthy lifestyle to begin with you wouldn't be in this predicament. It probably was eating at McDonalds and Zippys all the time that that caused your problem. Sorry, no sympathy for you!&&&11
Honey jars in carry-ons meet a not-so-sweet end - Columnists&&&Richard - What is diabetic food? Diabetics can eat anything they want as long as they offset their meal with the right amount of insulin. Eating foods high in carbs and fat is not good, but the carbs can be offset with the proper intake of insulin. Do you know how to count carbs? Ask your doctor to put you in touch with a diabetes educator. As far as I know there is no such thing as a diabetic approved meal. People often make the mistake of thinking sugar free ot low calorie means it's okay for diabetics. WRONG - diabetics need to watch their carb intake. Sugar free does not mean carb free.&&&2

Don't know where Shenhzen is, but I would guess it is somewhere either smack dab in the middle of, or otherwise near, a whole bunch of communists.

Not a good article. Very one-sided.&&&7
Johnson's system working just fine - Hawaii Sports&&&Can't we bring Johnson back to UH??? All you idiots that criticized June Jones for leaving after the Sugar Bowl should get your facts straight as UH abandoned Jones and didn't renew his contract nor open negotiations with Jones when JJ wanted to renegotiate his contract after the Hawaii Bowl...one year before the Sugar Bowl and treated his like a stepchild. Georgia Tech recognized the coaching quality of Johnson and renegotiated his contract after his 1st year yet even after the Sugar Bowll UH still didn't bring up negotiations on JJ's contract which was definitely a slight to JJ and that's the reason he left.....SO ALL YOU PEOPLE CRITICIZING JJ FOR ABANDONING UH, please think again as ALL DIV. 1 schools renegotiate coaches contract after a successful season and JJ practically had to beg and was turned down after the Hawaii Bowl one year prior to the UH going to the Sugar Bowl......BUSH LEAGUE UH got a bush league coach in MACK & HIS HIGH SCHOOL COACHING STAFF.....&&&6

Isle residents need more details about health reform - Hawaii E...&&&Does anyone think our delegation has read the health care reform bill to be able to be informative on it?! If there is a public option, Hawaii will wind up in the same boat as every other state, forced onto the govt. plan, sooner or later. Federal law will always supercede state law if there is a conflict. We won`t have an efficient health care system as private carriers will be forced out and Medicare is being gutted. The administration wants a single payer system; Hawaii will be included. This public option will be the ruination of quality health care nationwide, not to mention raise the deficit and taxes. I, for one, am no longer gullible enough to believe in these `assurances` from our leaders!&&&9

Gay or not, couples similar, data shows - Hawaii News&&&Gary J. Gates, PhD to the UCLA School of Law as a Senior Research Fellow. Dr. Gates is co-author of The Gay and Lesbian Atlas and is widely acknowledged as the nation's leading expert on the demography and geography of the gay and lesbian population. His doctoral dissertation included the first significant research exploring characteristics of same-sex couples using U.S. Census data. He has since published extensively on the demographic and economic traits of the lesbian and gay population. His work has been featured in many national and international media outlets, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, the Financial Times, and National Public Radio. Prior to completing his PhD from the H. John Heinz School of Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University, Dr. Gates facilitated the development of and co-authored a statewide HIV prevention plan for Pennsylvania. Gates' background includes a Master of Divinity degree from St. Vincent Seminary and a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. Dr. Gates' current research projects include a series of studies exploring the demographics and economic traits of Asian Pacific Islanders, Latino/as, and African-Americans in same-sex couples in California, a study of bi-national same-sex couples in the United States, and an NIH-funded research project comparing same-sex couples in the United States and Canada. He studies himself and his lifestyle? Is this really news or is the SB just trying to change the outcome of the next vote on a sensitive issue?&&&31

Hawaii organizes to help Samoa - Hawaii News&&&Why should anyone help or donate monies to the Samoan relief fund when it has been proven that much of the federal monies sent to Samoa the past several years to strengthen their emergency warning system were used to buy luxury items e.g. flat screen tvs. etc....When Gus Hannemann was interviewed on TV recently, all he said was stop picking on my peoples in Samoa. Yes, Hannemann, I'm pretty sure your pockets were lined with federal monies, too......Of course, its easy to make accusations devoid of proof but when the federal govt. ceased funds to Samoa, you know they had evidence to prove otherwise. TALOFA!!!&&&27

State wants tourists to pay fees at 8 parks - Hawaii News&&&I live in Massachusetts so I've occasion to try out the beaches on Cap Code. One thing I found most annoying and unfriendly is their admission prices. Residents can purchase season passes but the "tourist" has to pay. So there's no such thing as just plopping on the sand for a few hours; you really need to plan on a full day to justify the cost.(or go late in the day after the money collectors go home). I tell people that Hawaii doesn't sell its beaches--all are welcome.(I know Hanauma is the exception.) Although I plan to move back to Hawaii soon and so I might come under the resident waiver, I still think sticking it to anyone is a bad idea.(If you're going to charge for Haena & Hapuna, why not Ala Moana & Waikiki???-- crazy!!)&&&80

Federal funds considered to help fill in furlough gaps - Hawaii...&&&I swear I don't know who's dumber, the author of this article or the dumb a--ed legislators quoted. If they settle the issue of teacher furloughs they are going to have to face the same issue with HGEA school administrators and UPW workers. Perhaps one of these geniuses could explain how you run the schools with out the cafeteria staff, janitors, health nurses, security, principals and the office staff. Come on just one of you smart people explain how thhis will be done. If any of you had half a brain you would call the unions and state back together and get them to agree on a simple pay cut that would do away with the furloughs all together but we know everyone of the unions and legislators are in bed with each other. Please use your brains if you have one. If any of you need help getting your head out of your asses give me a call.&&&17

Danielson, Kaufman power UH - Sports News&&&I love our team this year & believe they can make it to the final four. I like what Shoji has done, but still thinks he should play more players against weaker team to build team reserve confidence & better team chemistry. Only critical observation I have is, I think Ferrel needs at times to know where the blockers are so she doesn't get block so often. She has the height & strength, but needs better accuracy.&&&1

Letters to the editor - Letters&&&Dangerous road needs fixing This is the first time I have heard Kaukonahua Road called Pine Tree Road. We always called it the Winding Road. Anyway, it has always been a very dangerous road. The city made many fixes to the road in the past few years. Better signage, rumble strips, etc. Yet, the 23 years that I drove this road each day, speed seemed to be the biggest problem aside from late night drunk driving. Many motorcycle accidents happen on the turns due to speed and inexperience of the rider. One thing that should be done is to prohibit truck traffic in both directions. Another is more random speed enforcement. It will remain dangerous unless drivers slow down.&&&6

Central Pacific stock falls; Fitch cuts rating - Business News&&&Hold on to your shorts! Wait until they sell the additional share in the bank and dilute the existing stockholder's equity. At that point, it will truly be a penny stock. Shame on the big bosses at CPB. From Ron Migita, Blenn Fujimoto, Dean Hirata and Dennis Isono to the dearly departed Clint Arnoldus. You took a profitable company and profited yourselves. Your loyal employees and their ESOP Plan, as well as long time shareholders who took pride in building the bank are now suffering tremendous losses. Obviously the Board is numb to the fact and continues to sit back and do nothing. How sad!&&&1

What hurts is they had to wait all these years for justice. Mahalo to Paul Alston and his firm.&&&18
Brief asides - Hawaii Editorials&&&That is one righteous story about Cho, especially the hardships his family went thru living in the car in Arizona. Folks like Cho, and Obama's grandma herself, are the only reason harsh critics like myself, of Obama's socialist leaning give away programs, are given consideration at all. Cho is the Horatio Alger story we need to hear about. THAT guy got heart. With drive, perserverence, dedication and hard work, Cho possesses all the qualities to break out of the communist model of the Hawaii Democrats, and to one day grow up and become a Republican.&&&1

School days off might be subject of special session - Hawaii News&&&I agree that we need to get our teachers back in the classroom, but all this talk has been about restoring funding. What should be done is revise that contract HSTA pushed through and the idiot BOE and Gov agreed to so that teachers just take a 8 percent cut with no furlough. They got big raises in 2005 and after. They can take a cut for 2 years if they care about the children like they claim they do. It's the union leaders who don't care about the kids and are just trying to push agendas that keep them in their powerful, well paid, furlough proof jobs.&&&43

Murder victim's family promotes awareness - Hawaii News&&&It's fine and well to say victims of abuse should recognize the danger and try to get out of it but more times than not there is nowhere for these people to go. Shame and humiliation on the victim's part plays a huge part also. Normally, it's when they start to get more control of their lives is when they end up dead. We have to get the abuser to change his/her attitude not the other way around. My deepest condolences to Chennel's ohana - especially her son. Now he has to grow up without either parent. Such a tragic shame! I hope she's resting in peace with our Good Lord. As far as her husband only God can judge but I hope that he's getting his just deserts in prison.&&&7
Warrior Replay - Hawaii Sports&&&Overall the Warriors had a good showing. But the lack of discipline continues to hurt them. The holding penalties, offsides, throwing into a crowd, all come at the wrong time and is expensive.&&&2

Encouraging tourism from China well-timed - Hawaii Editorials&&&This new market of tourism will be a boom for hotels, but thats about it. Existing transportation and tours companies will not experience thier business. They be catered to by Chinese companies already being established. Like the Japanese they will be serviced by their own companies. Hotels will be the only beneficiaries. Even when it come time for meals the Chinese will go where directed. So increase Chinese vistors will not matter much to existing tourist businesses. Now if we had a casino to drain them of money then we will benefit and I would say bring them on. Why does this state avoid gambling? We call Las vegas the ninth island and leave lots of Hawaii money there. What good is that for a state that is broke? If the state moves and establishes control gaming in a designated place to curtail the wrong type of gambler whats the problem? Time to stop being Daddy/mommy and treating our citizens like children in a candy store forbidding them from getting rotten teeth. These politicians are basically telling us that when it comes to gaming. In the meantime they are spending what money we do have so foolishly that we have to furlough teachers and necessary workers. Whats up with that?&&&23

Japanese in the spirit - Hawaii Business&&&Haunted Lagoon is Great ! It shows how much Local Talent there is! Laie has Great Artistic Talent, Performing Arts Talent, Entrepreneurial Talent!! But sadly the new BYU President Wheelwright & his team doesn't see our Talent ! Instead in their new fancy development plan , they're cutting back on Polyi/Hawaii Students, their funding & BYU's Hawaiian Studies Program !! Wheelwright's team is focus on exploiting our Ag land at Malaekahana/Gunstock Ranch to make it a new fancy town. They're bringing in tons more wealthy (student) visitors- like all the other developers! But our Community has such TALENT! Haunted Lagoon shows that we can come together and create great fun & economic benefits for our Community. Pray that the new BYU leadership sees all our Communities' true Gifts & Talents & develops a new plan that would use our talents to uplift our Community. Instead, the Envision Laie Plan is selling us short & selling us out....&&&28

Security blanket - Hawaii Business&&&Yes very true. There are people that just drive around and when they get close to an open computer they can hack into it and do anything they like. I say hack, but actually it's not even hacking. They just turn on their laptop and your computer is cold turkey. No one mentioned cell phones, but the same warning applies. People don't know that their cell phones are an open book. When your cell phone is turned off it still sends out signals to the whole world thanks to the new microchips built into them. Not only that but there are scanners in such areas as maybe Russia that scans all cell phones worldwide 24 hours a day. They can pin point your house thanks to the U.S Censuses and Goggles. Look at the new Google Earth software. What people see is the tip of the iceberg. If you want to pay money that software can do almost anything. Put in a street number, a phone number, a cell phone number, an area code, a zip code and you turn into mud in color. Have a nice day :)&&&4

Councilman ruled a resident of Lanai - Hawaii News&&&Jeff Kuwada PROVES Democrat corruption is alive and well in Hawaii and on Maui too. Way to go, Kuwada. Sol Kaho'ohalahala is a former OHA Trustee that went along with other "trustees" to fleece the REAL native Hawaiians and cheat them out of their 5(f) revenue OHA funnels to friends, cronies and others catering to the restore the foreign import concept of the corrupt "Monarchy." Let's see. State of Hawaii Supreme Court rules that Kahoohalahala is NOT a Lanai resident. Then along comes this Democratic hack Kuwada and says "I can't read, but it looks like the evidence says Kahoohalahala IS a Lanai resident, even if the Supreme Court already looked at the record and decided hack ho'ohalahala is NOT a Lanai resident." Somebody kick Kuwada out of his office, PLEASE.&&&14
Defendant to testify in home invasion - Hawaii News&&&"Testifying against all of the other defendants."

Business briefs - Hawaii Business&&&The description of how the $90,000 agricultural grant to UH: "will be used to help solve critical organic agriculture issues through the integration of research, education and extension projects..." is PAINFULLY vague. It's just the kind of money that can evaporate away with little or no accountability.&&&1
Letters to the editor - Letters&&&Dr. Iwashita's letter shows why Iolani School always had, and always will have, class. Yet the core Christian values Yamashita expounds in caring for their neighbors not wealthy enough to purchase their own homes and have to rent, is a quality and concern that their alumnus, Mayor Mufi, lost a long time ago and made evident in jacking up the rent of those that rent. Usually academic institutions of high quality learning like Iolani, will sometimes bestow honorary degrees upon individuals of noted contributions and accomplishments in their community. With Mufi, Iolani would do well to DEMAND that: the Democratic Hack who stabbed his mentor Republican Ronald Reagan in the back return the diploma he stole from Iolani. (AND Geller lays out yet another reason to kill the rail pig too).&&&46

Kuehu comes back fresh - Hawaii Sports&&&It is refreshing to finally see something positive come along for UH sports. This is going to be good for the program on many levels. The addition of Kuehu should be an improvement for the team and being a local high school star would bring in more interest among local fans. Just hope she is fully recovered from the knee injury. Good luck to her and the Wahines!&&&16
A loss that's not a blowout is an improvement for UH - Further ...&&&Hi Dave, I think like you, 2 maybe 3 wins are possible! I also agree the team did improve. Imagine if played with a few less errors, hmmm, we might have had a more impressive win than the 12-0 team. Especially when thinking the freak was just a freshman then and much improved now. I'm trying to remember the way the 12-0 team won at Reno. Wasn't it decided with a field goal that ice-man had to do twice? A game we were lucky to win:-). Wes&&&1

Homeowner investors face higher taxes with new law - Hawaii News&&&The missing link in the evolutionary chain of intellectual development here again rips off the common people who rent and cannot afford to own. Mahalo, Mayor Knuckle-Dragger. Although Homeowner Occupants may think they just a shot in the arm or "temporary fix" from the rising City taxes imposed under the outgoing Mufi regime, that are WRONG. The appearance is artificial and a political ploy by Mufi to ingratiate a segment of the voters, banking on this segment voting for him come election time. Listen up. Everybody and everything else is going to go up and, in the end, the effects will also end up going thru the roof of the homeowner occupants themselves. But to hurt the renters is callous and gives you a direct look into either how stupid mufi is OR how greedy this guy is, or both. Same like his "Shove Rail Down There Throats" style, same like surround himself with a bunch of smug bullies making up silly ryhmes on City time, same like his "act" about how "sensitive" the cave-man is---you know, when he act like he was going cry ontop his waste money rail t.v. infomercial-----THE GUY IS AN EMPTY SUIT ACTOR. Eh, Mufi, no act "cry baby." Mufi and his cronies should know today and in the future that, when they walk around town, or drive down the road, there are a whole lot MORE bunch of People that hate their guts.&&&26
Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Larry Geller raises a good point about the negative effect of elevated rail. But we must remember that in Mufi's plan, all development will be around the train stops. Mufi's camp followers will be controlling that development, they have paid into his campaign fund and now own those development rights.&&&3

For runaways on the street, sex buys survival - New York Times&&&*This is an engrossing story. I find it puzzling that the New York Times writer felt the need to take a dig at former President Bush in the last paragraph as the smallest amount of research would show that the Justice Department under the Bush Administration made stopping the human trafficking of women and children a top priority. Here's a Justice Department link from 2004 that details these efforts: A shame that this writer would use such a serious subject to make such a libelous claim. Very sloppy of the Star Bulletin to pick the story up with out doing the little bit of research necessary to recognize this fact.&&&4

Pack of gym rats proves too much for Wahine - Hawaii Sports&&&These guys must really suck if they only beat the Wahine by 15 points.

Parents urge action to restore days off - Hawaii News&&&State Board of Education Chairman Garrett Toguchi said without a doubt, furlough days were adversely affecting students' learning. Toguchi asked lawmakers to look at using money in the Rainy Day Fund and Hurricane Fund, and increasing the general excise tax. "We need this short-term relief for students," he said. -------Eh, Garrett Toguchi, you never go far enough. I want you and the rest of the undereducated occupying space on BOE, to look directly at the Rail Fund. I want you to Raid the Rail Fund. Spend every last dime in the Rail Fund BEFORE you start talking raising the GE tax. The Education of the Future of Hawaii is worth far more than a "make-work- project-for-the-politically-co nnected."&&&82

Isle task force unlikely to 'reinvent government' - Hawaii Edit...&&&...Created by the regrettably permanent task force called the Legislature, the group is supposed to "examine the current operations and organization of state government and make recommendations on making state government more efficient,"... Google "efficient" and you get about 142,000,000 hits. That is quite a few options for the task force. With so little time, the first thing they need to do is become "efficient" and reduce the number of options they have to choose from. Google "downsize" and you only get 2,420,000 hits to choose from. Click on the definition and you get the following: 1. To reduce in number or size: a corporation that downsized its personnel in response to a poor economy. 2. To dismiss or lay off from work: workers who were downsized during the recession. 3. To make in a smaller size: cars that were downsized during an era of high gasoline prices. That only took me ten minutes. Now that is what I call efficient.&&&12

The burden and hurt they feel is because they have great pride for our State and football program and I know they don't want to let us down. I've been going to UH games since the Aloha Stadium was built and I've seen it all. Now more than ever, we need to support these young men to help them through this tough time. Go Bows!&&&1

Student-teacher links suffer with furloughs - Hawaii Features&&&We applaud your testiment of and for the kids you've been made in charge of, those many years and hope your retirement is glorious. However, it appears you retirement funds are more on your mind then what has been written. What bothers me about this testimony was that you began it with your retirement fund loss. Although I symphatize with you on that point, but it seems your using the kids as the victims to your demise. Who is really suffering here? What teachers do, whether it be writing reccommendations to getting the school prom just right is commendable, but don't you have the option to opt out. Also agree with your husband up to a certain point. Some field trips are essential, but not all.&&&2
Governor to wait before raiding hurricane fund&&&Everyone acts like we have such a great public school system even before the furloughs and financial issues, we don't. It appears that most families are concerned with daily "child care" and education is not a problem. When will people realize the government is not responsible for raising your kids, you are. The government ultimately is not responsible for educating your kids, again you are. Quit playing the victim and grow up.&&&4

Terrific...Oahu is already too crowded and you want to spend 6 billion TAX dollars to make it even MORE crowded. In case you were not aware, Ohau is a SMALL island, Arizona is a pretty big state with LOTS of open land. Comparing the two is not even apples and oranges.&&&108

And the taxpayer continues to pay.&&&16
Mystery of fish mercury levels solved - Hawaii News&&&Sounds like the study needs to go even deeper to see WHERE the source of all this mercury is. The fish are getting mercury because the foods they eat have mercury. Okay, so where are the foods getting the mercury? They cannot dismiss pollution yet, that is premature. Maybe the pollution is deep in the ocean (illegal dumping) and that is why the deep ocean predators and animals have higher levels.&&&55

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr Dan Bryant brings up a good point. Mufi wants to start a project estimated from $6 billion to who knows how much in this ongoing recession. If he really cared about Hawaii and its future he would put a delay on this project for a indefinite period. To start this money sucking project now will be adding to our financial woes. WE must solve the ongoing problems at hand like the furloughs and our citizens losing jobs. We have done without this literail for 30 years whats another 2 years till we get back on our feet. If we start this project now we will be handicapped when the recession is over.&&&30

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Ref David Chappell's ltr. I am of the firm opinion that the use of instructional days for furloughs was initiated by the DOE to embarass the Lingle administration. Several questions come to mind. Why didn't the DOE/BOE start with the non-instructional days? Why didn't they shorten some of the paid holidays? Why didn't they rescind or cancel some of the paid six-month breaks for teachers (called sabbatical leaves) which would save the DOE over $2 MILLION dollars? Why didn't they trim the $1+ MILLION dollars for substitute clericals, or the $2.4 MILLION dollars for substitute custodians? Why has the DOE budget grown from $972 MILLION dollars in FY 99-00, to $2.4 BILLION dollars in FY 08-09, while enrollment and test scores have both declined?&&&22

UH earns ugly win over Fresno - Hawaii Sports&&&A pathetic performance against one of the dreg teams of the WAC and on national tv to boot which must have been hilarious to the other top ten volleyball teams who have claimed that Hawaii certainly proved that they don't belong in the top echelon of college volleyball. If they struggled against Fresno, can you imagine when they go into the regionals? I said it in the beginning of the season and will say it now they will not make it out of the regionals and then what will the excuses be for the coach playing against a cupcake schedule which accounts for his 1000 + victories. Not being critical, just realistic. If he was in the same conference in the Big Ten, Pac 10, SEC, or same conference with Nebraska or Texas, would he even have 800 victories?? I don't think so!!!!&&&15

Vision keeps monk seal in captivity - Hawaii News&&&"KP2 was abandoned after birth May 1, 2008, by his mother on Kauai" states the article. Now I am not an animal specialist, but I do know from visits to the Galapagos islands and seeing firsthand a baby sea lion that was abandoned by its mother. The guide explained that in nature the sea lion mothers would abandon sickly pups as they would not be able to survive in the wild. Sadly this is probably why KP2 was abandoned. Looks like it is true -- he is not capable of surviving in his native habitat without intevention. Question is - should NOAA folks have intervened or just have let nature take its course. Hopefully he will have a quality life in "captivity."&&&66

Facts can't quell rumor that Obama's a Kenyan&&&What a bunch of nonsense. The state of Hawaii bars release of birth certificate unless one has a "tangible interest?" If the people of the United States wanting to be reassured that their president is legally in that office is not a "tangible interest," then what is? Their refusal to release it and Obama's refusal to authorize its release only fuels the speculation, and they certainly know this. If Obama really wanted to end this, he could in five seconds. The fact that he hasn't means that he probably can't, and this just strengthens the arguments of those arguing that he isn't in office legally. The "facsimile" posted on the Obama website was also a joke. The document posted, if it really was a birth certificate, was incomplete in some places and unreadable in others. Again, if the Obama people wanted to add fire to this debate rather than quell it, they couldn't have done a better job.&&&976

City should avoid radical tax breaks - Hawaii Editorials&&&The greater issue with what happened at the Council meeting was that Hannemann only met with Council Chairman Todd Apo, who had opposed a separate tax category for owner-occupants. This came after the Council had already deliberated the matter and voted against it. "He wanted to explain to me face to face how important this was and that it was enabling legislation, not implementing legislation," said Apo, who ended up being the swing vote in the 5-3 vote approving it. Why just Apo? If the Mayor wanted to bring forth additional information that would cause the Council to reconsider the motion then he, as the Mayor, could have made his case publicly before the entire Council. That would have avoided the impression left that Apo was taken to the woodshed by Hannaman. It doesn't matter what was said or not said between the two. By doing what they did we are left with is a Council Chair whose has given the public the distinct impression that Hannamann is his "Daddy". That negatively impacts the public's confidence in the Council's ability to govern for as long as Apo is in a leadership position.&&&22

Don't reward illegal B&B operators - Hawaii Editorials&&&That pretty much sums it up and thanks to Mr. Bartley for his personal dedication and thoughtful, well timed commentary. Once again it appears the Star Bulletin is "getting it" right and listening to the folks. I would add that if this is allowed to occur, the damage would go beyond what is already mentioned. What would follow the tourists into the neighborhoods is what the tourists attract in Waikiki, i.e., crime and local "entertainment". Additionally, the acceptance of one form of commercial activity into residential zoned neighborhoods opens the door for other forms of commercial activity from the neighbors who want to hustle a buck and get a piece of the action. Once the precedent is set how will the City Council say no to property owners who, likewise, need to supplement their income with other creative forms of home businesses yet to be imagined? Instead, the City Council should be looking at a long term solution which would involve addressing the issue through the planning process. This starts by creating zones which allow the mixed use and these should be located next to the commercial zones. A successful and well thought out example of this approach is Carmel-by-the-Sea in California. They got it right. The Honolulu City Council so far has got it dead wrong.&&&98
Advertiser opts not to endorse any candidate for president - Ha...&&&The Advertiser's not endorsing Obama is very odd, indeed. There is probably much more than meets the eye here.

H1N1 is fresh fodder for anti-vaccinators - New York Times&&&Two of my dearest friends, my hanai Mother and my financial mentor and good friend both received the Swine Flu shot in 1976 at The Colony Surf Hotel in Waikiki and the both developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, which was later attributed to a "bad batch!" Watching both of these incredibly talented and gifted people die, is not a pleasant memory. They both loss their nerve sensory in their legs and then other parts of their bodies and ultimately died--a very horrible death... Sorry, but you can't convince me and don't try and tell me that because it's FDA and AMA approved that it's O.K. to give to my children and my loved ones... The FDA and the AMA are both politically compromised and owe their souls to the major pharaceuticals... So, please, take my dose and the doses of those whom I will lay my body down in front of who buy in to this shibai!&&&3

HGEA workers agree to cuts - Hawaii News&&&"In accepting these significant wage reductions, we expect the Lingle administration will look to ways other than layoffs to address the state's budget shortfall," Perreira said in a prepared statement last night. "It is incumbent upon our elected leaders to do what they can to prevent further job losses and greater impacts to the public services that our community relies upon." Hell will freeze over before this wish comes true. Of course there will be more layoffs. Come on Perreira, get the drift. The unions sacrificed the workers who did and will get laid off. Don't pass the buck, take the heat or get off the seat.&&&165

Study shows lifestyle changes work best in fighting diabetes - ...&&&Here we have yet another study that dispels the myth of the modern day "Big Hawaiian" label and goal aspired to by many who use that as an excuse to prepare for obesity, diabetes and a host of related health problems, known and unknown. In the days of old, the native Hawaiians were, by and large, lean and mean. They ate when they did, grazing mostly, as compared to the modern day "3 meals a day" structured regimin or excuse to "stuff your face" with spam, rice, portugeese sausage and any other high cholestrol, cellulite multiplying layers of crisco oiled blocks of butter feeding habits. In an almost welfare status display of wealth, some modern Hawaiians incorrectly think that the fatter you are, the more well off you are, because it proves to yourself and the world, that you have enough to eat----while also contributing to the rapid decay of your health, which, if taken to its extreme, would result in your individual health's demise, that would result in you dying, which means you would have no one left to impress because you would be dead and gone. Lean and mean. NOT fat, obese and diabetic. Not too late. Start by walking. Go slow. But, you better start hitting the gym, Hawaiian.&&&9

Lingle will promote state on tour in China - Hawaii News&&&Linda Lingle says: "We can't just sit by and muddle through these very difficult times," Lingle said during a news conference." Ah Governor, the economy has been going down the tubes for almost a year now. I think you are about a year too late. And by some accounts the economy is already kicking in. Duh. Can someone tell me what Lingle has done to help jump start the state economy in the past year or better yet what she has she done since she's been in office. I feel she should at least build a bridge in her name or something. Every other governor had at least on project that would be their legacy. Lingle's could have been the SuperFerry. I liked the concept. Very cool. But the state's handling of the project turned the project into a big debacle to say the least. People on Kauai literary screamed FU when she went there to speak. That was the last time she every went to Kauai. I don't blame her. But I feel really sorry for the company that built the SuperFerry and then found out that they did not have the proper authority to run it even if Lingle did give them the okay. What a waste. I wonder how much money this company lost due to Lingles blunder. Lingle's brightest moment could have been this furlough. She could have come out smelling like roses if she would have taken a leadership role like she admitted she should have done in this furlough mess instead of letting it spin out of control. What will be Lingle Legacy? I think the Governor's seat is a dead end for politicians. Not one of them has gone on to do bigger and better things since they have all left office with lower approval rating than when they started. Their will be people blaming the legislators, unions, blah, blah, blah; but Lingle promised in spite all this she was a force of change. She was going to change things. She was... yeah right. Okay, Mufi. You next. God, I feel sorry for you already.&&&75

Lingle not to blame for teacher furloughs - Guest Editorials&&&At the foundation of all of these "difficult decisions" is greed and short-sightedness. Certainly, it is not the will of the people to destroy our beautiful community. However, that is what we are in the process of doing because, supposedly, we are not willing to pay what it costs to maintain our community at the basic level it has been in the recent past. Many, if not most of us, could kick in a bit more money to maintain a quality education program and meet other costs for basic community care. The amount of additional money it would require from each of us is a rather small price to pay. Somehow, those in power assume that we would rather trash our community and eventually watch our quality of life go downhill. Next on the chopping block is likely our first class University of Hawaii. The Manoa campus is a "money machine" where faculty bring in something like five dollars for each dollar invested in the university by the State. Student numbers are increasing while funds and faculty numbers are dropping. Further budget cutting will definitely damage the ability of faculty to continue to obtain external funding. Personally, I would rather tighten my own financial belt and maintain my community. Unfortunately, it looks like our State legislators and executives will not begin to entertain this option.&&&7

Kahuku's defense must step up to beat Castle - Hawaii Sports&&&Can someone tell me why the number one team in the state is playing at 4:30 again? It seems that Kahuku always gets screwed by having to play the early game in the tournament each year. Can someone (who has access to this data) look up to see if I am just bias or if my accusations are substantiated? We are traveling the farthest of all participants and yet we have to play first (on top of being the top seeded team?). Who makes the decisions and based on what criteria? Is it because Kahuku brings the fans no matter what time? If that is the main reason, thats screwed up. I feel that the top ranked team should always be given the main spot but I guess that only happens if you are an ILH team or are in cahoots with the schedulers(?) or powers that be. I still feel that with the loss of 14 starters we are still good enough to beat Castle (their QB isn't as elusive as McKinney and it will be dry for our DE's to fly around and put pressure). It is especially interesting to see that this whole season focused on how good the west was and yet as most years, the east is better represented in the playoffs with three versus one from the west. Just a thought... Anyways, good luck all and enjoy the rest of the season. Above all go OIA and beat the ILH. Red Raider for Life signing out.&&&5

Top honor goes to isle soldier - Hawaii News&&&Anthony Kahoohanohano died during the Korean War after killing 13 enemy soldiers -- two with a shovel -- as he covered the withdrawal of his squad. That's what you call "guts." It is a quality shared by many who serve this Great Country of ours in our darkest hour of need, on the field in combat, facing any enemy who seek to destroy us. In this account, the bestowing of this Nation's highest honor is befitting, as Pfc. Kahoohanohano not only brings pride and honor to His Family, but also the Veterans of the past, present and future. Our Ft. DeRussey War Museum houses and represents many of the Veterans and their Memoriablia from WWII, the Korean War and the Vietnam conflict. Earlier erected down the other side of Waikiki Beach is our WWI Natatorium National Memorial. Thank God out going mayor hanneman will not be able to destroy the Ft. DeRussey War Museum in a manner hanneman seeks now to destroy and rip out the WWI Natatorium National Memorial. Pfc. Kahoohanohano gave his all for America. However, hanneman immigrated here and wants to destroy a part of America by tearing down our Natatorium, and it looks like hanneman wants to honor his German heritage (and Samoa that was a former German Protectorate during WWI, when America defeated Germany.) America is defended by folks like Kahoohanohano, that gave his all. It does not belong to immigrants like hanneman masquerading as a Hawaiian, that wants to destroy a part of the memory of Veterans of WWI.&&&27

Hawaii makes case to national audience - Hawaii Sports&&&I only hope that Coach Shoji would play more of the reserves rather than use the starters in game that is already in the bag. Protect the starters for the post season. When you have starters in games that has already been won within the first two sets, you risk injury to the starters. Give your reserves playing time just in case you need them. "Go Wahine"&&&4
Fire destroys SUV at Honolulu Community College&&&I was the security manager for the apartment complex just behind HCC for several years, many times we complained to the city that the parking lot should be gated and closed at night at least on the Robello Lane side, to prevent all the druggies and gangs from running through on their way to and from Mayor Wright, and that the school could be held liable for damages or injuries, guess now the taxpayers are going to be out some green. Maybe they'll learn one day.&&&1
Furlough opponents must consider all budget options - Guest Edi...&&&In accounting classes administration cost are considered overhead. That overhead cost is roughly 43.1 million dollars. That's the operation budget for the Governors and Lt. governors, and State Legislative office. I maybe wrong, by a few zeros. I seriously think we should furlough the office of the governor and Lt. governor, and the state legislators. Close the door's and turn off the lights. Our leaders have failed in their leadership to provide the alternative industry to tourism that Hawaii needs. From the Supper Ferry, a space launch center, high technology. The state has known for years that tourism would become highly competitive world wide and it would impact revenue. And here we are. I say no to the elected leaders and say we can do without a state legislative and governors office for a year, not teachers. We can also cut the state DOD budget that runs over 100 million a year, it's a duplicate service. We have sooooo many military personnel here, why do we need a state standing army. There are lots of other ways to make the budget meet the priority of Us Guys. Not You guys. Everyone of our "leaders" sold themselves to be leaders of education. You have failed or lied, standard practice? who cares, what you say. What I say is furlough the state leadership for a year we don't need them! Just tinking&&&1

When a teacher is forced to buy a dvd for their classroom at Border's for $15 (Border's is a preferred vendor) while not being allowed to buy the same dvd at WALMART for $5, the public will be shortchanged. White board markers at Fisher (preferred vendor) are $1 each. Same marker at WALMART? 5 for $1. Sony dvd player from a preferred vendor?$200. Same dvd player at Best Buy?$40.

New after-school program helps kids connect and learn - Hawaii ...&&&Not a new program as Kalakaua's former Principal had set up an afterschool program that encompassed tutoring, study hall, and with Gear-Up monies from the UH-Manoa, other activities in Math & Language Arts besides activities by the YMCA were established for the students. The reason program diminsihed was lack of interest by students who after a period of time lost interest and didn't want to stay afterschool. Even students that were identified as special needs students were asked, with parents permission, to stay afterschool to get tutorial help in their language arts & math but that also was hard to sustain as students didn't want to stay afterschool etc.....&&&2

Donovan worked his way to the top at UH&&&If there was one reservation about Dononvan that people pointed out was his remark to Riley wallace. Having read his side, people should be reassured. There's a big difference between being concerned about someone and trying to calm Rile y down by saying "Are you trying to make it a 2 for 1 deal" versus actually threatening Riley by saying "You want to make a 2 for 1 deal"? Big difference...I'm glad it was clarified because the latter just didn't fit his profiled persona, and now I'm even more enamored by Donovan. I've been a long time UH fan and I'm prettin excited about its future!&&&3

Gotta keep two eyes on those s.o.b.s as they continue to starve their common people, imprison even perceived threats amongst them, in an ultra-paranoid environment whose closest proximate example to be drawn here in these United States is found among those surrounding the cult personality worship of out going mayor hanneman.

UH QBs getting healthier - Sports News&&&I'm still behind our Warrior football team and their coaches have 100% of my support. I still believe that they can make it to the Hawaii Bowl. I still believe that they will beat Nevada and will be cheering them on TV this Saturday. I was totally disappointed by this weekends loss to Boise ... I expected an upset. It was painful but I stayed to the end of the game to show my support to the player. I know that they want to win more than anybody else on this planet and their hurt is a zillion times more than mine because I'm not slaving it out on the practice field everyday. So, let's learn from our mistakes and get better, we got a bunch of injuries, missing a bunch of starting player and got a ton of young players getting a lot of play time. Ignore the naysayers. Trust your coaches, believe in the system, work hard, focus, and do your very best. I believe good thing will happen.&&&6

Enable workforce retraining and preserve jobs through cross-training and creation of new skill sets within the utility. " How is this going to help greater Oahu with power outages? It looks like we could have invested more, and received more. Can someone explain? regardless, can HE put more money towards smart meters to help customer's monitor and reduce electric bills? How about putting our transmission lines underground to reduce outages caused by storms?&&&11

If the athlete wants to perform at a level above his competitiors and get larger contracts, use steroids.

Boise State shows Hawaii who's boss - Hawaii Sports&&&Please, with all due respect, someone, please explain why the State of Hawaii is paying the head coach close to $1 million a year? When you add to the equation all the assistant coaches, trainers, facilities, maintenance, insurance, airfare, hotels, food, etc. what exactly is the cost to the taxpayer for this toy team? Is is honestly fair that serious students cannot get the classes they need to graduate for lack of professors while the football team is granted so much financial largesse? At some point you have to decide if you want to be a school with a football team or a football team with a school. If the adults may have a serious conversation without the fanatics drowning out the debate, it may be clear that football, which has recently been proven to cause brain damage to high school and college players, should be downgraded in favor of non-violent participatory sports that will enhance student health while eliminating or radically reducing such a waste of money.&&&40

Program to pay for renewable energy - Hawaii Business&&&Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, renewable energy programs are corporate greed in a green wrapper.

Imagine if you produced a TV show and the cable co. just reimbursed you for a fraction of your cable bill while you paid for the entire production. What make this program GREEN is the CASH electric companies are making.&&&15

Then a news item is repeated on at least 3 later news casts. There is really nothing fresh. I like to flip from station to station and get a real feel for what is going on, but it seems like all I am getting is just a different face saying the same thing over and over again.

Very proud and happy for you and the success of your career, but this movie really left the crowd wondering what they just spent the last hour and a half watching.

Hawaii doctors frustrated by pay setup, AMA chief says - Hawaii...&&&Bang !! Just now waking up?:) Many great doctors have retired already and went out of business. Many that are still in business can't do common things like surgery for example because of the huge liability insurance and with this Medicare and Medicaid mess doctors can't even do their job that they were trained many years to do. It's really bad now. Add Evercare and Aloha Care then you have one complete nightmare. I just can't believe that the AMA never heard about it? Search Evercare or and Aloha Care on Google then you will see firsthand how frustrated the doctors are? There are lawsuits going on every place. The State really screwed up and someone must be making some big bucks under the table in order to let this nightmare continue. The doctors are hurting and the patients are really hurting also big time now. Why can't any one trace the money trail? Look for big boats and huge mansions at the end of the trail. The State, the Doctors, the tax payers, the Federal Government and even the patients are paying out the nose and yet the AMA says they never heard about it before? Well, ok then I'm trying to believe you. Now you know. Aloha&&&24

Witnesses saw beach struggle - Hawaii News&&&Three Royal Hawaiian hotel employees told police they saw a man on top of someone who was kicking on the beach fronting the hotel early Oct. 2, according to court documents. Two of the employees said the person underneath was a woman, while the third was not sure. One of the employees, a cook, said he saw the man on top of the woman, "either shoving or choking her with both hands near the throat area," the documents said. The cook told police the man "made the choking or shoving movement five times, then stopped, for a total of 30 repetitions," the documents said. He said it appeared the man was also trying to hug or kiss the woman, and she was kicking her legs, but that neither of them was making a sound during the encounter, which lasted about 10 minutes." There has to be a charge that can be brought against these three for failing to assist the victim. The cook's description of the incident seems prurient, almost pornographic. How anyone could allow this assault to continue without intervening or even calling the police who are, after all stationed nearby, is simply astonishing. Can they be charged as accessories? Why are their names not mentioned? Do they have criminal records? Are they acquaintances of the accused? The desensitization of society is on display here in all its ugliness. So much for the land of aloha when professionals in the hotel field care so little for others that they will watch such a thing for ten minutes and leave another human being to her fate. I hope the family of the victim sue the hotel and these individual cowards for all they are worth. Absolutely disgusting!&&&292
119-year-old rebuttal of critic of Damien retains power today -...&&&Good stuff. Also this... Father Damien had "Protestant minister and patient J. K. Kahuila put in irons and removed to the Oahu prison" for "rebellious" language. Shortly after that "Damien was informed that the duties of superintendent were to be assumed by (another person). After his death, the Catholic church created, perpetuated and published exaggerated myths about Father Damien having superhuman strength, to "recruit young clergymen" and "raise money". These Catholic biographies provided the basic elements that would be elaborated into the "Damien myth", including his "pious childhood", the "childlike and immoral state of lawless lepers", and the assertion that he was "strong enough to carry a wood beam that would take four Hawaiians to lift" (from Damien's letters to his family, which "exaggerated adversities at the settlement and his own importance there." However, Ambrose Huthison, a patient who knew Damien, insisted that the priest was of medium height and "an ordinary plain man in every sense".

Leilehua does enough to advance - Hawaii Sports&&&What I saw last night was very sad. These are kids and the game was decided by the refs. With Kalaheo leading 14-7, and with the ball and momentum, their RB ran wide for about a 60-70 yard TD. However, the TD run was called back for a penalty. Well that is cool, since penalties can open up holes for that long run. But, the penalty wasn't a holding call or a clip, or anything which led to the long run. The call was a personal foul 30 YARDS behind the play. C'mon, that is pathetic. If Kalaheo was up 21-7, that game was over. What is worse is that Coach Martinez (the most unprofessional coach in Hawaii) was about 15-20 yards in the field. But he gets no warning or flag? C'mon, let the kids decide the game. 30 Yards behind the play? That is ridiculous.&&&6

Pay cuts alone don't save enough money - Guest Editorials&&&Mr. Okabe, let's get this straight. Teachers have NOT taken a pay cut. They have agreed to a furlough. A pay cut would mean getting a lower number of dollars per hour of work. Many powerful labor unions throughout America have accepted huge pay cuts in order to avoid massive layoffs. Why didn't Hawaii teachers take a pay cut? because the teachers' union has the politicians in their pocket. Lingle should never have offered furloughs. Lingle should have told the union: Here are a specific number of dollars to pay the teachers; you (the union) figure out whether to do it by pay cuts or by layoffs, or some combination.&&&2

Group looks at reshaping government - Hawaii News&&&The lead line in the story: "The state's reinventing-government task force, made up of Hawaii business leaders and lawmakers, met for the first time yesterday to brainstorm ways to keep the budget-strapped Hawaii government running in a sour economy." Aren't these the same people who gave us the Hawaii Convention Center, the Aloha Tower Market place and the Aloha Stadium along with the three government bureaucracies (Hawaii Tourism Authority, Aloha Tower Development Corporation, Aloha Stadium Authority) needed to oversee them? And there, in the middle of the heard is Randy Perreira, executive director for the Hawaii Government Employees Association who is a major stakeholder in preserving the 53,000 state employees jobs and the skyrocketing costs of the associated retirement benefits. I cannot wait to see who will be the first of those who gave us the present overinflated state government to stick a pin in the balloon.&&&81

How about doing MORE for the economy, get people working then THEY can get their OWN insurance. Sorry you wasted your money getting them elected although in Hawaii, for the most part, Democrats get elected anyway and always have. Perhaps next election you can find a candidate who will give you more handouts, seems that is what you are after.&&&66

Blessed day for Hawaii - Hawaii News&&&Oh my God. I cant believe you had to write something negative in the article. Im sure everyone felt the "crush" not just those from Hawaii. This should have been a positive upbeat story but you had to go put a negative spin on it like it only affected the islands. Yah, the pope must be racist.&&&25
H1N1 is fresh fodder for anti-vaccinators - Hawaii News&&&In the 21st Century there are still many who are anti-science. They still staunchly believe in creationism and think the universe was created 5,000 years ago. No surprise there's so much confusion about vaccines.&&&3

Obama deserves Nobel - Hawaii Editorials&&&Let me see, a law professor and community organizer, 6 years in the Illinois senate basicly staying an unknown, one whopper of a speech at a convention, 4 years in the US senate, two of which were spent on the road trying to become president and for the other two, not one single piece of legislation was passed because he championed it then 9 whole days as POTUS before being nominated...certainly I can see the similarities between him and Mother Theresa where earning a peace prize is concerned. He said it best himself, I don't deseve this. At least he is donating the money, hopefully not to Acorn.&&&85
Don't bug me - Hawaii Business&&&...for your information it can easy to detect bedbugs on mattresses by looking carefully along all the seems of the mattress as this is where they seem to congregate...the boggahs can run around real fast too, so they can go anywhere like one cockroach...heads up the seems...my friend took the mattress outside under his lanai and waiting to take the mattress to the dumps instead of poison on the mattress. In a few days, the bedbugs were still there but all maki...not sure yet about the hatching cycle of the eggs. But if heat can get them...better to put your mattress in the sun when can. Have fun.&&&4

It's up to McMackin to turn fortunes around - Further Review&&&Perhaps he made those comments because of columns like this one. Everyone knows it was a bad loss, and it's common sense that it's the coaches responsibility to take care of the team. Reading negative editorials put everyone in a bad mood. I don't even follow the Warriors closely, but I knew this season was going to be a challenge. Coach Mack was frustrated at the press conference, and apparently you were frustrated at his answers.&&&2
Boise State shows Hawaii who's boss - Sports News&&&this kills me living in Southern California as I feel maybe the biggest Warrior fan out here. To see a 2-0 start turn into 5 losses and likely no bowl this year is a huge step backwards. I thought losing Alexander would hurt. It has. Then again the turnovers blew open this game after a 1st quarter of respectable defense. The run defense is horrible, huge gaps, poor tackling all signs of a bottom 10 defense. I love Greg and this year clearly over. I expected some drop off due to heavy heavy graduation losses. It was not expected to fall apart like this. Correct me if I am wrong, but we seem to have good recruits coming in to improve this team by 2010. Please tell me I can hope. The concern is in the past June could put in a number of quarterbacks due to injury and all could perform. Not now. Why are these backups seemingly not as prepared and ready to come in and make an impression like June could do with his stable? Is the offensive line that bad? Does not seem so bad block running. The pass blocking is awful. I in years have not seen a powerful Run and Shoot get pounded and look so inept for 3 weeks now. Will we win another game? Navy will have 300 yards rushing when they play us&&&11
Grumbling about rail isn't going to go away - Hawaii Editorials&&&Well written, informative and coherent. One point of disagreement, IMHO support for the rail is highly questionable. The state's fiscal crisis has changed the landscape and with the state not providing essential services such as classroom time for the children, the choices are becoming more clear between current needs and questionable infrastructure projects.&&&9

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&I'm all for the death penalty. But, sadly, that is not a deterrent for the criminal minds that prey on society. They don't care if they live or die. And, Death Row costs the taxpayers more. 1 appeal, that's it. Execute within the year. The current 15 years on "Row" is a total miscarriage of justice. The cost is $38,000 per inmate, per year.

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&"Our recession-wracked economy needs the jobs that rail construction will generate." That would be a great idea Mike except for tiny little problem. The funding for rail is coming from that same recession-wracked economy.

Rainbow Wahine will stock scout team with men - Sports News&&&Not to surprising that Dana is doing this. Vince Goo did this when he was coaching and Bolla also was trying to assemble a men's team to compete against the girls. It's a little more complicated process, as the guys from the competing team must be full-time UH students (12 credits). They are entitled to receive gear and equipment like shoes and practice uniforms. At least that's my interpretation to it.&&&1
Let teachers vote again - SB Editorials&&&Gov. Linda Lingle once said she doesn't want "to raise taxes or lay off employees." Yet, she already laid off some state employees so why not just increase the sales tax a little for 1 or 2 years to help with the budget. She already went back on her words... So, whey is she still stick to not raising the sales taxes??? Nobody wants to increase taxes but if you have to choose between your kids' education or raise the sales tax... which one do you want? In this economic situation, many of us don't have a choice.&&&1

Fire McMakin&&&Is Greg McMakin apart of the HGEA or UHPA? If so can Linda Lingle fire or furlough him? That way we can get out of his overpriced contract & give him his walking papers. I think we rushed into giving Mac the head coaching job and have payed a heavy price. We have endured this season with bad publicity(gay slurs), bad attendance, lack of discipline on the team and lack of professionalism on the coaches. They say a team reflects leadership, well that does say a lot for 5 losses in a row. Why wasn't Funaki used at QB, or even listed as a backup, bad leadership. The kicking game was absolutely shameful a 1 yard punt last night & constantly missed field goals throughout the season. Fire or Furlough coach mac&&&3

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&You know the city/state could just hire guys to dig ditches and then hire some other guys to fill 'em in. That way everybody has a job and we don't have to worry about the damn rail anymore. And no worry that they not actually accomplishing nothing because the city/state workers we get now no accomplish nothing anyway. Rail is only stimulus program we have It's about time the city started awarding construction contracts for the rail system. Our recession-wracked economy needs the jobs that rail construction will generate. Let's face it, rail is the only bright spot in this dismal economy. Tourism, our golden goose, has stopped laying the golden eggs that deliver paychecks and spending cash to families. As a result, we're all hurting whether you have been furloughed or not. We need new jobs and new revenue to stop this slide. Rail construction is the only worthwhile economic stimulus program we have. Mike Chang Honolulu&&&5
Lessons learned - Hawaii News&&&Hawaiians are fortunate tohave the expertise of Gerard Fryer and Ed Teixeira. The importance of a Tsunami Emergency Evacuation Plan is the key. Earthquakes in the Hawaiian Archipelgo have the potential to create devastation and chaos. The moment an earthquake is felt or one has information, consider the potential impact at the location you are at the time. Make a decision and take prudent action. Coastal parts of Hawai`i are high danger zones.&&&5
Rainbow Wahine will stock scout team with men - Hawaii Sports&&&It's not very fair to scrimmage against a team that is un-coached. But I guess the males won't be having a coach either. Maybe they can get someone from the Department of Land and Natural Resources to join them.&&&2
Welcome to the neighborhood | Kailua - Guest Editorials&&&"More local-type businesses". That would bring more locals into the area and have the opposite effect of what is desired in Kailua.

The only "locals" they want in the neighborhood are their Filipino gardeners, and they want them out before the sun sets.&&&2
Farrington follows through in playoffs - Hawaii Sports&&&Farrington played a hellava game against a very over-rated Kapolei team. There defense 201 yards, offense 260 yards, and the special teams who couldn't get 11 players on the field made the Hurricanes into more of a drizzle than a game. The next time they play, I will just stay home and save my money because they own Hernandez and the Hurricanes! It was so bad for them that even there star recruit and a coach had shoved their trainer because they were upset, auwe! It shows that even when you illegally recurit, still boils down to the coaching. For coach Hernandez even if people say Cal Lee did this, he still won 13 prep bowls! Having that many yards and giving up that many, showed your coaching ability once again.Stick to recruiting and sneding guys to college not coach. Like my father once said if you can not play with the big dogs stay on the porch.&&&1
Boise ramps up BCS status - Sports News&&&I also hope those east coast BCS snobs saw this convincing contest. It was a start-to-finish display of football excellence. A team that fired on all cylinders ... at will. A team that belongs in the big dance! Before the game, I predicted 55-6. It ended up 54-9. As smart as I felt for almost nailing my 'home' teams winning score, I admittedly felt a little sorry for the Bows. I watched the pounding with my usual band of local Bow braddahs. Per usual, I was the lone BSU fan. Normally I'd be relishing in my teams convincing win. Ya know, talking trash to counteract all the pre-game abuse I was forced to endure from my Bow counterparts. Normally. But that game was so one-sided, it was hard to stay puffed up and pipe off. It was hard to see the Bows get blown out that badly. It was hard to my buds so deflated. I love a good hard fought win. This game was anything but that. Ya see, it's not that I hate the Bows. It's just that I love my Broncos. Lots of hard football work to do here on the rock. Good luck braddahs, in time, you'll be back. And when you are, we'll be here ready to lay down another beat-down upon ya!&&&1
Boise State the mid-major Hawaii wishes it could be - Hawaii Sp...&&&I'm tired of hearing how inexperience the Warriors are. The Broncos have only 2 seniors on their 2-deep chart and still win. Its all about coaching and the program they institute. Hopefully Mac and staff can emulate BSU success next year, maybe its not the inexperience of the Warrior players but their head coach. If Warrior fans had a choice would they pick Petersen or Mac to head the Warrior program?&&&13

Hawaii reforming child welfare service - Hawaii News&&&If Hawaii cares so much about providing quality child welfare services then why have they decimated services by laying off so many social workers? Do they really think that services won't be impacted? I guess kids lives really aren't that important to Lingle and the do nothing legislature.&&&5
Boise focused on WAC, not BCS - Sports News&&&Man to man at every position, Boise has better players than Hawaii. There is not a single Hawaii player that matches up to a Boise player at their position so it really doesn't matter what Hawaii does e.g. strategy, schemes, playcalling it won't make a difference as Hawaii is way overmatched and, in reality, Hawaii is grouped with the lower dregs of the conference. Any thought of Hawaii being equated with the top tier teams of the WAC conference is the figment of one's local imagination. Heck, Idaho has moved into the middle tier of teams whereas Hawaii has precipitously dropped into the bottom where it is currently ranked as the 18th worse team in Div. 1 football. Can you imagine that???? I just hope that Bobby Curran on his daily sports talk radio show doesn't give off any more jibberish that it wasn't embarrassing for Hawaii to lose to La. Tech on national t.v. Who is he kidding?? WHATEVER PEOPLE THAT WAS WATCHING THAT GAME MUST HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AND MAKING A MOCKERY OF HAWAII!!!&&&6

I really wish them well in the playoffs but like others are worried, our Wahine's gonna have to come up with some stunning magic to beat those giant gals from Texas and Penn State. Everything's possible but will it be probable with the statistics? Well, as long as our Wahine think they can go all the way and bring home that national title, I'm with them all the way.

Let's not forget what really happen at Mililani. Though Akuna played outstanding, they were outplayed with the exception of a couple of big plays, which Akuna was a part of. They were only got 150 yards on offense and their defense gave up over 400 yards. I that they can get big plays again from their offense and defense again.&&&1

Snub on Shoji reflects poorly on Hall of Fame - Hawaii Sports&&&The answers are too obvious but most refrain from vocalizing the reasons. First, its the University of Hawaii and secondly, its the WAC. East Coast sportswriters, especially the guy on ESPN radio, has very little respect for the WAC. He referred to WAC football as a "Flag football conference." But this is not uncommon, but a fairly common view of the power brokers in the East. This view spills over to all other sports such as men's basketball and as a result, Wahine volleyball, unfortunately, falls victim to this same categoric view of Hawaii and the WAC. Unfair? Absolutely. But who in the East really gives a hoot? Hawaii? Go back to surfing at the beach. Leave big time collegiate sports to the BCS school conferences.&&&15

Many families come here from other states with IEP's already written that address how many minutes/hours of SpEd instruction. These IEP's are legal documents and the incoming state (HI) only has the right to change the format...not the content or amount of services. How does the state propose to address this? It's already at the point that military members are loathe to come to HI because of the negative impact the schools have when they leave Hawaii and thier childred have to attend schools in other states. I hate that this was the decision, HI is basically throwing away an entire generation. How can you compete in this country and globally if your education is substandard?&&&198

Letters to the editor - Letters&&&Construction worker Aaron Yamasaki is so right about getting construction going for the Honolulu Rail Transit system. The original plans from the early '90s were, in my opinion, much better (and MUCH cheaper!) But, the current plans will accomplish basically the same mission. The mission, moving LOTS & LOTS of people to a very centralized destination (Downtown, Airport, Waikiki & UH) within the least amount of time.... All of the rail naysayers have either never been to a city with a good rail system to see that they work (especially in Jpan). Or, they are the Special Interest people such as Cliff Slater and many others who stand to make fortunes on Automobiles, Buses and/or Gasoline. In the early 90's I spent years working for the Oahu Transit Group designing a light rail system for Oahu. It was awesome, and would have been in operation now if it weren't for the corruption of former City Councilwoman Rene Mansho, who's last minute swing-vote killed the railproject (I wonder who paid for her last minute NO vote?) She voted YES 2 times, then on the final and crucial vote she suddenly and very unexpectedly changed her vote to NO. She then cost the City of Honolulu an extra $4 Million for breach of contract with the Oahu Transit Group. Of course then Councilwoman Rene Mansho went off to Prison for other crimes. Look, there will always be traffic on Oahu, always. But, seriously, Oahu need an ALTERNATIVE to the automobile! You can still drive your cars if you'd like, but with Rail you be getting to your destination faster than the automobile drivers. Much faster. RAIL!&&&14
Mililani's Stevenson sets his sights on Washington - Hawaii Sports&&&Another top state prospect leaving for the mainland, looks like McMackin will have to settle for White division honorable mentions and maybe some senior third string guys from Kahuku, Kamehameha and the like!!!&&&1
Schools seek to swap training days to keep classes going for st...&&&Let's get this straight. It was the governor, not the legislature that proposed that money be taken from the DOE budget and replaced by federal money. Most of the rest of money then when into the State general fund to help balance the budget. I remember this very clearly, as the governor robbing Peter to pay Paul. Why is Linda Smith trying to distance the governor from a proposal she made inthe first place?&&&41
Muzzled KGMB-TV execs cannot discuss branding - Hawaii Business&&&I support the media council's efforts with the FCC to block the shared services agreement. This control of three stations by Raycom only invites more control over our local news. Not a good thing!The Hawai'i public already misses out on a lot of World issues.&&&7

Sealed fate - Hawaii News&&&Maybe what should have happened is the Molokai community talking to its residents about KP2 before NOAA was contacted. It was an honor for Molokai to have the seal adopt it, but the community also had a responsibiltiy to keep it safe. Having the seal acclimate to human contact...and people encouraging that contact would be a difficult dilemma and not safe. I don't like seeing it possibly leave the islands, but if it can't be left in the wild and undisturbed then it needs to at least be safe.&&&22

Hopes fade for comprehensive climate treaty - New York Times&&&All the world gatherings to save the planet of global warming are an exercise in futility. The same people will still drive their cars, eat their meat, use driers instead of clotheslines and contribute to worldwide deforestation with their consumption habits. If they truly want to lead, then lead by example instead of paying lip service. Thus I stopped subscribing to newspapers and magazines a long time ago and read everything online; take my own shopping bags; consume as little as possible, bicycle and recyle and subsist on a vegan diet. Back home I use only solar power for both electricity and water heating. I do my best to maintain a low carbon footprint. If everyone lived like me we wouldn't have to worry about global warming, pollution or depleting our natural resources. We wouldn't need international conferences to mull about all this and pretend to do something. I know the naysayers would say that our economy would go down the drain if people lived like me, to which I say that it will anyway once we melt down our planet out of existence. We take care of our environment now or it will "take care of us." (not in a way we'd like).&&&3
Hawaii's multitasker - Hawaii Sports&&&Stephanie has been outstanding this year. She is one of the top athletes on the team and Dave has found a way to exploit her talents. The setting has left a lot to be desired the last several matches so Mufia better get back her early form or Stephanie could be used at setter. This team will go far if everyone plays to their potential. They are sure fun to watch!&&&18
Hawaii's multitasker - Sports News&&&I really enjoy watching Stephanie Brandt play volleyball. Her positivity radiates on the court, you can just feel it in the stands. I've been very impressed by her unselfish attitude. She's clearly talented and could have started on many teams. Thank you Stephanie for how you play the game, I'll miss watching you next year!&&&1

Furlough Fridays fail to invest in kids - Hawaii Editorials&&&Furlough Fridays are not investment deficits. The dilapidated schools are investment deficits. And even if all the buildings were pristine and fully equipped, investments in alternative programs--non-college bound programs--would have to be made. Where has business, construction, and tourism interests been hiding since the huge education budget cuts under Governor Ariyoshi's second re-election term? For at least 29 years education in this state has spiraled downhill and now with Furlough Fridays, a mere 17 days, we are creating an investment deficit?&&&18

Hawaii Sen. Inouye moves up in seniority - Hawaii News&&&In recent years, Inouye has become known for his ability to bring federal money to his home state, and he even declared himself "the No. 1 earmarks guy in the U.S. Congress" in August. Now that's some real Pork.&&&35
Religion risky for GOP - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Republicans should be concerned about a hijacking of their party by religious activists..." disagree --- in Hawaii, Republicans should be more concerned about whether anyone even bothers to participate and it certainly is not a hijacking of a party if nobody is running and nobody is involved in the first place perhaps, the true concern of the editorial writer is that the Democrat party is not meeting the needs of its members --- and the real hijacking will be getting those church members more active or at least open to the Republican side at a minimum, this would assist the GOP in holding ground on the highest position in the state&&&39
Recovering bite victim says he's got no beef with shark - Hawai...&&&E kala mai but I surf and know that he should not have been there at that time and knew the dangers yet is now trying to be portrayed as a victim. He is a victim alright... as in a victim of his own stupidity. He put his selfishness ahead of his safety as well as other people's safety which will get no sympathy from me. Instead I feel bad for other surfers who may suffer the wrath of other sharks who may return.&&&12

Muzzled KGMB-TV execs cannot discuss branding - TheBuzz&&&we already know of the name "Hawaii News Now" due to KGMB's live shots of the soon to be former KHNL studio during almost every newscast-why can't we know more? probably because of the media council's opposition of the merger & KGMB/KHNL awaiting official word from the FCC - this is all strange because Ramsay Wharton, Tina Chau, & Ashley Nagaoka are all gone from KGMB + the building KGMB broadcasts in has been torn to pieces & the set relocated to KHNL- doing all of that & not allowing the viewers to know the new stations team/logo/promos all before a monday launch is strange- layoffs & moving your set without sharing any information about newscast times, anchor teams, station names is kind of jumping the gun if you ask me.....&&&1

Hawaii unemployment at 7.2% in September - Hawaii Business&&&Hawaii has enjoyed artificially low unemployment rates due to its high number of government jobs. This is a government we clearly cannot afford, and our limp news media are not covering this extremely important matter. People are fleeing the State, so the number of productive workers to support the unproductive ones is shrinking rapidly. We have a giant problem, and no one is talking about it. Imua!&&&9
Tying the knot - Hawaii Business&&&Aloha hard... Covering up inherent problems with glossy ads and PR people really makes for a shallow type of fix. Hawaii does have issues with a proper type of attitude towards each other. Things that make Hawaii unattractive/unsafe for tourist is the same for the locals. If the locals can not even take care of these issues themselves- how can they take care of tourists? The growing eyesores of Graffiti, mentals walking about, the predators that still walk about freely, the non caring- it's not my problem about other whole hosts of issues. Who the heck wants to come and see all that - poking them in the eye. The beauty of the Tropics can be had in other safer/nicer places. Get a grip Hawaii. Take care of the problems in a definite/ permenant manner instead of playing hot potato with it and bounce it to some other agency or group. Aloha hard...&&&20
Call the police - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Reprehensible as they might be, incidents of failure to notify police during violent crimes are rare; a national average of 1.6 nonrescues a year." Where did the Star Bulletin come up with this statistic? Did they just make it up? Think about it: according to this claim there are, in our entire country of over 250 million people, fewer than 2 cases a year in which bystanders see a violent crime being committed and don't immediately call police. That's ridiculous. How can anyone even know how many times this happens? If the witness keeps his or her mouth shut and never steps forward then nobody will ever know about it. If the three idiot hotel workers in Waikiki didn't speak up later then we never would have known there were witnesses. So clearly there is no way to know how often crimes in progress go unreported. The Star Bulletin then uses this obviously bogus statistic to argue there shouldn't be a law requiring anyone witnessing a violent crime to immediately call police. Way to go Star Bulletin. Always thinking of ways to protect the criminals and endanger the victims. Your devotion to moral relativism leads you to excuse all kinds of unethical and immoral behavior. You can't exactly say it is ok to do nothing while watching someone kill a young woman, but according to you it shouldn't be illegal because it doesn't happen that often. OK, sure. Presidential assassinations don't happen that often either. Maybe we should get rid of laws that make that illegal. Wonderful logic there Star Bulletin. Congratulations on yet another amazingly dopey editorial.&&&17
'Third rail' of isle politics looms just over horizon - On Poli...&&&This is Colleen Hanbusa's gift to her Democratic colleagues. Or was it a gift to Duke Aiona and the Republicans? Had the bill passed this last session, as it very well could have had Hanabusa and Taniguchi honored promises they had made, civil unions would have started on that Jan 1 effective date, people would see the sky hadn't fallen. All but the most rabid would have adjusted and we could all be focussed on the economy for the 2010 elections. Ah, but Hanabusa was able to demonstrate her gift of "leadership" and force her colleagues to deal with it in an election year. Brilliant! Let's end her to Congress as a reward!&&&4

You don't. Mufi knows best so just keep silent and let him lead us down this path. So what if it costs more. So what if no one rides it in the numbers they estimate. So what if it has to be heavily subsidized. So what if the federal dollars never show up. So what if it does not serve everyone paying for it. So what if it does not do anything for congestion. So what if it is an eyesore.&&&330

Strains for Democrats in budget-balancing act - Hawaii News&&&Balancing the federal budget is a no-brainer for someone with a brain, which excludes the corrupt Walkin', Talkin' BS Machine in the White House and all of his corrupt clowns in Clowngress! Here's MY sure-fire plan to stop this fiscal madness by and for the corrupt is for said Walkin', Talkin', BS Machine and his said corrupt Clowngresional cronies: (1) no additional Porkulus; and stop the present Porkulus crony payoff in its tracks, (2) no additonal bailouts FOR ANYONE OR ANYTHING, (3) tax the 40% of the voters that DON'T PRESENTLY PAY A NICKEL in federal income tax AT THE SAME RATE AND ON EVERY EARNED DOLLAR that the rest of us are forced to pay, (4) get your obnoxious, overbearing, corrupt nose out of health care and any other thing not specifically authorized by The Constitution, (5) quit your perennial obsession of PUNISHING THOSE WHO WORK AND PAY TAXES while REWARDING THOSE WHO SIT ON THEIR OKOLES, MOOCH OFF THE REST OF US, AND DON'T PAY TAXES; a good start would be a flat tax for everyone with no handouts our deductions for anyone! Problem solved!'Nuff said...&&&2

Principals, HGEA workers join teachers in furloughs - Hawaii News&&&"Furloughs will require us to pull together in the best interest of Hawaii's keiki" quoted Hamamoto in a letter. Why did the BOE, DOE, and HSTA decided on furloughs instead of an 8 percent pay cut? What PR crap to feed the public "it's for the kids". It's all about politics and self-interest to protect their HIGH 3 RETIREMENT benefits. Let's call a spade a spade. The economic situation might not improve in the next two years and may linger on for who knows how long? If that happens, I hope not, will the HIGH 3 be reduced by 8 percent?&&&47

Dave Eldredge lived a full baseball life - Hawaii Sports&&&I was a student in Dave Eldredge's Science class, then later a player on his football teams in the 1970s. The man was big in stature and presence in the classroom and on the athletic field and commanded the attention of his pupils and players like no other. To put it succinctly, he WAS Punahou, and personified all there is about the institution in teaching life lessons. He certainly had his way of doing things and you learned to get on board with Dave's Way, which was clean and straight with high moral standards. The thing that I remember most about him ... which kind of surprises me ... was that he always had this mischievous glimmer in his eye. They say a man's eyes are the windows to his soul. True enough with Coach Eldredge ... a big man with big soul.&&&6
Hopes fade for comprehensive climate treaty - Hawaii News&&&"The United States and many other major emitting countries have concluded that it is more useful to take incremental but important steps toward a global agreement rather than to try to jam through a treaty that is either too weak to address the problem..." Well, since THERE IS NO (global warming) PROBLEM, what is there to address????? The earth's temperature (measured by satellite by the NOAA) has been cooling down for the past 11 years...duh! Those of us who have something-of-science degrees know the difference between science and political blather of artsy-craftsy-degree types like Al Bore; the REAL science shows us that for at least the past 400 million years, we are at a LOW in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and we further know that there is NO direct connection between CO2 in the atmosphere and mean world temperature. It's the sun's output that either freezes us, fries us, or keeps us comfy. So there is no problem to address, right??? Only the lolo politicians that want to bankrupt us are right, right??? WISE UP people, you are all being played by a bunch of self-serving lolos!'Nuff said...&&&3

Not that Leon W-J wasn't going a good job, but if you have a "stable" of running backs, then why not use them? Make the defense at least think about the run.&&&106

Nomadic Heun moves to middle - Hawaii Sports&&&Coach, it's time to forget about the Ws and Ls. It's now about the players, especially the seniors. It's too bad about Letuli. No more injuries will mark a good season. Hope Letuli returns quickly to finish out his career. He's missing out so many games as a senior. Seems this is Hawaii's fate this season. Alexander lost his final season with his knee injury; Bradley, his Jr. season; and Satele out for the season. Here's hoping no further injuries. Players put in a lot work and dedication, need to get rewarded by playing and having fan support. As much as I have criticized the play and coaching for the last four games, it is now about allowing the players to take the field and enjoy themselves. I will be at the Navy game to cheer them on.&&&5

Activist is not Lanai resident, court says - Hawaii News&&&What is this "talk" about Kahoohalahala being an activist? Maybe a former OHA Trustee hack, that saw no problem and went along with OHA spending 5(f) money on non-beneficiaries who that State calls "Hawaiians" but are NOT native Hawaiians as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, which that specific portion of 5(f) money that OHA receives and is limited to these "native Hawaiians" of the HHCA, 1920. Anytime anybody can get one of these current or former Trustees, for whatever reason, and here for essentially lying to the People of Lanai AND the Supreme Court ("oh yeah, I one resident of Lanai"), then GOOD FOR HIM and them too. Kupchak deserves credit for kicking Kahoohalahala's butt. And, you're right, Kupchak, Kahoohalahala was illegal from the beginning when he registered to vote in Lahaina back in 2006, before his current Lanai term began. This "I going register to vote in Lahaina, ignore the State law about running in, and epresenting People in the district I reside in" is something Kahoohalahala apparently learned from being an OHA Trustee, where they all are right now ignoring the federal admission act limitations on the use and expenditure of the 5(f) monies. Kau Inoa that, Kahoohalahala.&&&3

I bet you if it was the other team they would have gotten a yellow card. I heard that the referre and the coach from Moanalua is good friends that is why the game was so juice. The OIA shouldn't have friends referre games like that. Let the kids play and win the right way not the wrong way. Shame on you.&&&1

King, Queen, Prince, Prince----who cares?

Achieving the ultimate goal this team is capable of doing would be the icing on his 2009 season. If it comes, it comes. If it does, it was meant to be.

Hawaii Humane Society has hunting policy - Hawaii Features&&&Kudos HHS! Carefully and legally managing the wild hog population protects every other animal ... from deer to songbirds ... that fall victim to a habitat threatened by overpopulation and the aggressive and omnivorous feeding habits of pigs. And please everyone, bear in mind that no dog owner would willfully put his prized hunting companions at risk. Not to put a fine point on this subject, but virulent anti-hunters are the cruelest killers of all: they conveniently forget that hunting is the most effective management tool for rampant wildlife overpopulation stressing a dwindling habitat. Taking a few individuals out of the total allows the rest to thrive with less threat of starvation, disease, and violent death by predators that seek out the weak, young, and old ... often eating them alive. NOW THAT'S CRUEL.&&&7

We have been working to advocate a wider acceptance of support legwear for men for nearly 10 years now, and it's been taking hold much more during the past two years. I host a blog called The Nylon Gene ( ) that details many of the practical reasons for which men are now wearing support legwear, and how it is no longer seen as a garment intended solely for women.&&&1
Rainbows become morning people - Hawaii Sports&&&It's almost comical to see a story by SBs Brian McInnis a few days ago saying that UH basketball has a legitimate shot at a post season tournament when one preseason poll has them ranked as 230th best team. Now the coaches and media poll predicts them to be last in the WAC. To some UH fans, the truth hurts. Give it another month and then check the comment sections. Going to be just like what you see in the UH football comments with angry fans and folks calling for some heads to roll. Reality check. Go Bows!&&&3

Learn the fundamentals before flying with fruit - Hawaii News&&&School Teachers should be well taken cared of, like the Police, Fire, Ambulance & Military. They are teaching our children and sitting for the parents. They have a difficult time, but they are doing. They all need our support for our future leaders of tomorrow. Parents please speak up for our teachers, cause they all need our support for the time and effort they give to our children. It is very important for us to help out each educated teachers, for they are doing a great job and it is not easy. They need patiences, psychology and talents to teach today. Aloha and give them the income they need to survive today. If they get good income, they can help our children with modern equipment. Mahalo&&&4

Aneli, you got the killer instinct when it comes to putting balls away. I'm really proud of you. Everyone's getting better each match. That's a good sign as we head into the last half of the season...Wahine will win the WAC, no if's and's or but's about it. Finishing 2nd in the NCAA Championship would be awesome against those giant gals of Penn State but winning the Championship would be out of this world miraculous and oh, what a party we would throw...Wishful thinking but I like thinking positive...Good Luck na Wahine.&&&1

School did not report alleged sex assault of 12-year-old girl -...&&&So ... are we to understand from this that, had the parents decided not to report these crimes to the police, KS would have declined to? What happened to the "in loco parentis" status of a boarding school's acting in place of parents to ensure the safety and protection of minors who are away from their homes? Sounds like there is some legal posturing going on here with KS maneuvering in anticipation of a big lawsuit, which the parents of the victims should file if for no other reason than to educate the administrators and board on the consequences of negligence. Now, KS may have avoided notifying the HPD because they wish to keep open the option of claiming that the sexual activity was consensual; that would allow them to deny any responsibility. Of course it would blame the victim and throw her under the bus, but it would allow them to discount any claims of negligence. There will be more to come out in this case that will reveal why KS did not report the crimes immediately, but deferred to the parents to do it. What cannot be explained or excused is how other students likely were exposed to danger while KS passed on their responsibility to act.&&&256

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Mona, Rob and Pat, I think your hostility is aimed wrong. It isn't just the Republicans that wonder at the Nobel Prize. There are many from both sides of the aisle as well as the middle questioning it's sincerity. It was a manipulation of the Socialistic Norweigians to try and aim this country into being what they want us to be. The President knew he was nominated and therefore held off assigning more troops to Afghanistan to support the troops in dire need. This was irresponsible and down right dirty politics. To think otherwise is being very naive. Don't for one minute think the President was taking his time to think this through. He had plenty to say while campaigning and made many promises and has kept none. He is the Commander in Chief, he should have had a handle on the war situation this whole time, there should be no need for down time to think this through. He has gotten advice from his Generals and he has ingnored them. The people want him to be accountable for his actions. The so called "peace" prize has lost credibility, it has become a joke. This is the man that snubbed the Dali Llama, one of the most peaceful men on this earth. This is the person that should have been awarded.&&&161

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Open hotels to the homeless" You have to be kidding. There are already shelters they can go to but many do not. Why? because they have RULES. For some reason I just can not picture say Hilton having homeless people occupying rooms next to visitors. When the homeless themselves decide to better their lives they will. There are a multitude of paths they can choose besides sleeping on the sidewalks. You can not force them to do anything. The services available to them are set up so they have to make the first step.&&&34
Salas to stay put at slot - Sports News&&&I hate to say it but we have ZERO chance of not getting blown out by Boise ST. I haven't felt this way since Fred's final 0-12 year. I think we are that bad again. From top to bottom there seems to be no emotion, no fire, no foaming at the mouth....football is a game of emotion. Mediocre talent and no fire will never win a game. During JJs 2nd year, when we only won 3 games...there was promise. Even though the record was terrible, you could see promise in every game. This is different. There is no promise. Instead I foresee the beginning of a streak of losing seasons unless change is made. JJ didn't turn things around with only the run and shoot. Instilling belief and fire into the team was a key ingredient to the Warrior's success under JJ. For what ever reason this coaching staff has proven to be incapable of motivating the team. They're just not cutting it. Unless we want another streak of being the WAC cellar dweller and one of the worst teams in the nation....Mack and company has to go. Sorry Mack, nothing personal, you're just not getting the job done. Performance plus inappropriate off the field comments, equal dismissal.&&&1

Natural selection - Hawaii Business&&&All this empty "Go Green" popular in Hawaii with the "Save the Whales" and the "Malama the Aina" fads, give the consumers producing this extra large carbon luau foot print a false sense of "I doing something for hang out with the Euel Gibbons." Bogus. Just like the fatsos stuffing their face at McDonalds that go to the high class gym to pretend to work out. Eat, eat, eat....then go to the gym....eat, eat, eat.... Same here.

State, HGEA could reach deal in days - Hawaii News&&&A furlough doesn't 'amount to a paycut,' it amounts to a partial layoff, with no work being performed, for no pay. The furloughed person is free to earn money on their off days by doing some other form of useful work someone is willing to pay for. By calling it a 'paycut' the author artfully skews the article in favor of the expected tone of pity for the poor unfortunate employees.&&&110

How did you verify it in 1961? Reading this piece in 48 years means whatever it says is true also right, because it is in the paper and on a disk somewhere? I am glad one, maybe two, people on the inside have seen the records and proclaim them genuine. How many people have seen the Loch Ness Monster? More than two therefore it must be real also.

Another sore point about education is the Federal Education people. They create tons of paperwork for teachers while not teaching one child. Get rid of those paper pushers.&&&101
Buffs knock Crusaders back - Sports News&&&I could not feel anymore discussed by the performance of the Crusader's coaching staff over the past six years and especially over these last two. First, the once proud and stellar defense is abysmal. Since the departure of Jacob Yoro as coordinator, the defense has been less than mediocre. The new staff just doesn't fit and mesh. The offensive sceam needs to change as well as the coordinator. Vince Passes is the best QB coach in the state. As OC, not so. Since WHEN can you not score a touchdown when you have the ball first and goal from inside the one. WHEN you never line up under center, your offensive line is in a two point stance, and you hand the ball off to your running back 6 yards deep, no tight end or goal line package moving forward wedge blocking; that's WHEN! I know that the coaches that have more than 6 years of experience up at Kalepohaku remember the Elephant and Jumbo packages. What happened to it? If employed over the past six years, the Crusaders would have been a lot more successful, perhaps 2 or 3 more state titles and Delbert Tengan (remember the 4th and one punt) still the coach. Coach Hao is in the seat now and has to make changes. The student athletes deserve better. Recommendations: Change the OC and DC. As much as possible, use experienced Crusader alumni coaches that have the TRADITION. Don't emulate UH.(Why would we want too?) Install a traditional running game so that when teams rush 3 and cover 8 (Pun) you can run the ball. This is basic. Go Saints&&&14

Easy Sunday for Shoji - Hawaii Sports&&&Coach Shoji deserves every accolade attributed to him but what's more important is that Shoji exudes class, character, integrity, and humility not only to his players, but to the school, State, and most of all, to his family. An example of a rare breed of coaches in any sport who makes do with the talent he gets and produces winners.&&&2
No peace from jokes for Obama on Nobel prize - Guest Editorials&&&Since the Democrat Congress eliminated the Washington, DC scholarships for low-income kids to get vouchers for private schools, the Prize money should be donated to the fund.

Furloughs carry special legal risk - Hawaii Editorials&&&A "school month" is 20 days. Our keki will lose a month of instruction. Regardless of the care and concern our parents have, most are not trained, skilled, experienced educators. This year the children will suffer. As they become adults, with less than an excellent education, the lack of knowledge and skills will mean Hawaii will suffer. It seems the politically "correct" decision was to make certain groups pay for the deficit rather than to raise taxes on the majority of folks who may then fail re-elect the politicians.&&&40

Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&Regarding the health care assistance for the people of Micronesia, it would seem that the state of hawaii has no money to pay our teachers but have adequate funding to pay for these people to continue health care benefits, Howcome? the federal government should be the ones to apply the payments/reimbursement and also why should we the people of Hawaii provide them with food stamps, welfare and housing and that our state cannot even provide it's own people with adequate living allowances due to these microns taking and taking when many of them are more than able body to work, but hey are flat out lazy! I have never meet anyone of these people who like to work for a living they all want all the freebess we the state of hawaii has to give, without any any break of sweat from them. that sucks!I know that now they have to pay a co payments when they go to the Hospital and most of them don't want to when prior to this everything medical is paid for get with it people of Micronesia you need to get off your fat/colorful butts and get the hell to work do this the real american way, and not the way of simple easeness and continue to rape us we the people who have to pay the taxes so what you can all drive fancy suv,trucks etc get a job!&&&2

Covert comic craziness - Hawaii Features&&&To the walls of Cuba. " To more than ten million of Cuban slavery by the dictatorship of the revolution of Castro and to the hundreds of thousand or countless disappeared ferrymen, to the streamlining, the political prisoners, etc., etc." I had walls, transparent, with the moon and sun reflections; water walls that surround my island and separate it of the rest of the continent. I had walls, if, walls that were worse than the Auschwitz wire fences, walls alive full of fish predators, so high and deep walls, that its move challenging the horizon. Prisoner my people, my Cuba's country, by walls that simulate an infinite sky, cached by the ocean in a piece of earth that moans by the freedom, by the anonymous heroes and martyrs, the men lives where the seed still sings and the palms are silent because of the fear. I had walls, gray, blue and green, and although today I do not contemplate those walls from my exile, the remembrance drill the distant memory and any shout of desperation it imposes pardon of death and forgetfulness. I had salty walls, those walls, that when so many thousands of people tried to cross it in one way or another, to flee from the hunger and the repression, they, who were children, young men, women, old people, they were shipwrecked, lost themselves eternally in those walls, where the tourists Canadian and European, perhaps do not know the palate of the oppression, and they celebrates their vacations in those sunny beaches, meanwhile the Cuban people, day after day, captives of the tyrant, without being able to emigrate, nor to escape, they lies in silence surrounded by those walls of the sea of the Caribbean.

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&If we pull out of Afghanistan, the Taliban can declare victory, easily recruit more to fight for their cause, and have more money to hit us at home. They will have their home base and, more than likely, move back into Iraq. Rest assured, their direction then, will be another 9/11, here on our homeland. Had we stayed in Viet Nam, the outcome would have been different, but the anti war protesters were out there and the N. Vietnamese saw that the US was not willing to incur any more causualties so they stuck it out. According to N. Vietnamese generals after the war, they were ready to negotiate a peace in defeat, except they recognized our mentality. They were right. So, the strongest nation on earth was defeated. These Islamic terrorists want us dead. Sleeper cells are already here, thanks to our lax govt. creating an out of control immigration policy. Next, this administration will be granting an amnesty to all illegal immigrants, not just from Mexico. There will be no background checks; criminals, gang members and, rest assured, terrorists will be granted a legal status. How can this be good for America? This country is spiraling downhill and most don`t even know it! Big govt. takeover will not only invade all privacy in our lives, but also make choices for us. The people are protesting but the administration snubs their noses at us and continues with their agenda. Where does it stop? Taxes will continue to rise and if you don`t comply with what the govt. wants, you will be fined. Redistribution of wealth? Where`s the incentive to work hard, only to have to support a bunch of people who want to be taken care of on somebody else`s tax dollar? Fight the war to win, enforce our immigration laws, stop federal funds to sanctuary cities, and have a policy that basically says, if you don`t work, you don`t eat. Pioneers built this great country because they had a vision and a dream. We can have neither with govt. controlling our lives and taking our money. We need to see the big picture here. Our president said he would fundamentally transform America. Is that what we really want? I don`t.&&&31

You were sentenced to 5 years in prison for car theft now looks like you'll be spending a lot more time than that. What was the motivation? Were you angry that you're in jail? or did this guy look at you wrong? Oh well, looks like you'll have a lot of time to prove yourself over and over and over again. When you get in your 40's some cocky 20 plus year old will be taking you on. Hopefully, you'll live to talk about it. If not what comes around goes around. Best of luck to you and condolences to that man's family.&&&19

Some workers resigned, some upset - Hawaii News&&&Iris Takahashi is a single mother raising two children in elementary school and supporting a third in college on her salary, but she took a hit for the state yesterday so it could balance its budget. Is it the states fault that she chose to have additional children? With her position how did she swing having 2 more children as a single mom? Get the deadbeat dad to pay up also. The college student should get a part time job. There are people out there who dont work for the state and have to work 2 jobs just to pay the rent and have no children. Talk about spoiled.&&&120

Police will check parking at Ala Moana Beach - Columnists&&&I am glad that there is safety check stations doing their job. Way too many cars and trucks are reconstructed without RC permits and get new updated safety checks. I drive for a living and see a lot of thesee lowered or tires sticking way out, ect with new safety checks and no police enforcment. I guess it is had for the polioce since their cars (many of them) fall under the reconstruction laws. Can't give a ticket if your car can't pass. Wish I had a number to turn in these illegal cars and police reconstructed vehicles.&&&7

Holiday help - Hawaii Business&&&Many retailers are using the recession and Christmas to exploit new workers that they treat like slaves. No coffee break, no lunch break. Working extra long hours like way into the early morning then cut their time off just enough so they can call them only part timers. Giving them only minimum wages with no benefits. Hiring hundreds of extra workers that they treat like slaves until they drop and then the workers will just quit on their own because they cannot take it. It's all calculated exactly by the retailers knowing very well that 95 of the workers will not last until Christmas, but in the end it's just right for the retails. Then thanks to our government the workers are being taxed to death. What happened to all the investigators that are suppose to protect our Hawaii people? Interesting, but I'm sure you will hear more about this from the actual workers themselves so you don't have to believe what I say.&&&1
Bankrupt firm plans $11.6M in bonuses&&&This is just a load of crap!

Yellow Pages popular but also annoying&&&There are way too many phone book publishers for Hawaii and none are any good in my opinion. Many times the distributors just dump the phone books off next to the main rubbish container by the hundreds so most of the end users never even see them. Well, maybe that is better anyway. Every phone book is different and many are so large that it's hard to carry them around from room to room in your house. The best solution ever is to go on the internet and find any phone number you want within a few seconds. Hawaiian Tel has a great service for this and it's free. Wonder where all the trees went? Well, now you know there all being used to make phone books.&&&14

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&John: Why do you and others assert the president has done nothing? This is the kind of letters that people are getting tired of reading because for one thing, it is repetitively totally negative. One of the first actions by the president was to close down the prison camp in Cuba, and he has stopped the torture of prisoners of war, which is to say, he is following the terms of clauses of the Geneva Convention which the nations signed onto long ago. My great great grandfather was one of those who wrote them. He is honoring the words of those wiser men than we apparently are today as we snipe at each other in negative short phrases over the internet. Anyone who could see, he came to Hawaii to commune with the spirits before he ascended to the magnitude of his responsibilities as president of the United States. This award is for many steps President Obama has been seen to be making internationally in the right direction towards world peace. You might try to learn more about what he is doing.&&&19

Furlough agreement will not avert layoffs, governor warns - Haw...&&&Subcontract the United Public Workers jobs to those who want to work or make them part time so some of the unemployed that want to work can. Better yet if cost savings come too slowly from the UPW foot-dragging layoff MORE to achieve the same cost savings if they had made a quicker decision. After all time is money. My sympathy of course to all those taking paycuts, furloughs, and layoffs. A new reality we all share.&&&97

Report upholds ruling on Pacific Beach staff - Hawaii Business&&&Ever since old man Herbert Hayashi (founder of HTH)retired and his daughter Corine was given the CEO job, the Pacific Beach hotel went down the tubes...from a ohana-like working environment, it went down into a hell hole with labor disputes and poor unkeep of its establishments. The other Oahu hotel operation of the HTH empire was the once popular Pagoda operations.

Maybe this is regular kine stuff but I don't see Coach K, Coach Williams, or other coaches at the clubs with the kids who they mentor/coach. This is the pure blueprint of a social predator. It seems that a motive is to surround yourself with weak minded ladies wit low self esteem and make dem think they need u. After pau, she can have her pick. Auwe!&&&2

Vacation rentals not the culprit in Laie woes - Hawaii Editorials&&&The statistics show that in 2000, 79% of home sales in Ko'olau Loa were to local (within Ko'olau Loa) addresses. In 2008, that number was 47%. Sales of houses in the region in 2000 to mainland addresses were 9%. In 2008, that number was 29%. Sales to addresses in Hawaii, other than Ko'olau Loa, were 12% in 2000, and 24% in 2008. So it's not necessarily the bed/breakfast argument. Source here:&&&62
History says Enos could be difference vs. Fresno - Hawaii Sports&&&Enos did make a contribution, but it wasn't enough to win. Fresno scored over 40 points and there's no way they can lose.

UH building closures possible during breaks - Hawaii News&&&"UH spokeswoman Carolyn Tanaka said the contract will save $7.5 million for the university if approved. She said the University of Hawaii Professional Assembly was offered a similar 5 percent pay cut with 13 days off. That deal was rejected by the faculty union." This certainly will not generate much support for the UH faculty in the future.&&&29
HGEA should accept contract - Hawaii Editorials&&&I'm a state employee, and agree that we need to make some sacrifices, but what most people fail to see that the medical premiums have also gone up and the Governer wants us to accept that burden also. With furloughs this amounts to about a 20% loss of income. I'm all about "sharing" the burden, but to ask "state employees" to accept 2 losses of income is a bit much. People also fail to realize when the ecconomy was going great, and the public sector was making a lot of money, state workers still got the minimal pay raises, 2% over 2 years etc...raises you could barely see in your paycheck.&&&21

Mokulele and go! merger is a good move - for now - Hawaii Edito...&&&Any discussion of Hawaii’s Inter-Island carriers and competition is unjust without mention of the criminal aspect of Go!’s entry into the market. Even after two Federal Judges rulings there are people who believe Go in fact had nothing to do with the demise of Aloha. Noting could be further from the truth. This man came to Hawaii to specifically destroy 3500 Hawaii jobs. While I always agree that competition is good in any market, having airlines charge less than it costs to operate provides nothing more than instability and chaos. What these people have done to inter-island travel has made a mockery of what was once a decent career that provided families the ability to pay tuition, raise their families, and pay taxes within the state of Hawaii. To also not mention the fact that both Go and Mokulele import their employees in the higher paying jobs and cheat Hawaii out of taxes and these careers also only tells half the story. Airline managers of today no longer care about my career and needs. They have learned to line their pockets with cash that comes from me under the pretense of this thing we call competition. As someone within the industry with a different perspective, I now wonder if the people of Hawaii will ever understand the value of safe, reliable air travel that provides local jobs for local people.&&&9

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Re:Murder witnesses were accessories It is truly inconcievable that anyone, let alone three people and hotel employees to boot, would be witness to a woman struggling with a man on the beach and do absolutely nothing. Even if a couple were having sex on the beach, that sort of activity should be reported to hotel security and the police. The Royal Hawaiian Hotel fronting the beach is so close to the waters edge that if the witnesses could see them, they could hear them as well. It really is such a narrow strip of beach. Those people didn't kill Ms. Antone but they did stand by and watch it happen. Worse yet, turned their backs and went on their business and another tourist found her body at daybreak. I would hold the hotel partly responsible for not providing security to the hotel guests.&&&32

The economic slow down got rid of the poor stinky ones, but the rich ones are still there and complaining about everything. The plastic bag ban is good for the environment but at what cost? Are we willing to pay more at the store since the biodegradable bags cost more? Look at the additional costs and problems the Bottle Bill, the 10% ethonal and even our renewable energy policy is costing the locals of Hawaii. Being environmentally friendly will cost money - and that means higher cost of living in paradise.&&&16

Softball pitcher's circle may be moved 3 feet back for 2010-11 ...&&&HHSAA casn never seem to make a decision that benefits the kids. Moving back the pitching rubber for "varsity" players only helps them in preparing for college, and mainly (the main reason for the rule)is safety. Studies have shown that there are less injuries from pitchers being hit with batted balls at the 43 foot distance than the 40 foot distance. HHSAA put off going to metal cleats for a year after the other 49 states transitioned. I'm unimpressed. National federation comes out with changes, yet Hawaii knows better.&&&1

Pearl City complex debuts with new-to-Hawaii chains - Hawaii Bu...&&&Petco is kinda overpriced in the market, and doesn't have a large selection that you would expect from a mainland retailer. I guess that company recognition is more important to them than the products you carry. Bright, with wide aisles, the store is pet friendly so you shouldn't have a problem roving around with your pet dog. The management needs to go around to other pet stores to see what they carry and bring in products that the other stores don't. Otherwise, I wouldn't be shopping in there regularly.&&&9

Your stove top will be glowing red--this is much hotter than the black coals. It's sad to see this misinformation being presented to a gullible audience as fact. Yes, coals are less conductive than the coils on your stovetop. That, in combination with a lower temperature than 1200 F, is responsible for this "mystery".&&&5

Four days of classes and three days of play. Christmans vacation, spring vacation, summer vacation, all federal holidays, in service days....our kids will be out of class more than in class this year and the next. Hawaii's school system is the laughing stock of the planet. Why don't the teachers do the right thing and work for free on those 17 Fridays? How are they going to feel when years from now their students are still flipping burgers becase these kids wanted to learn, but their teachers just wanted to earn. I leave it to other posters to discuss the effect this is going to have on working parents. I pity our school kids.&&&292

The pope's remarks - Saint Damien&&&Damien is completely dead. Claiming that he has "eternal life" is just more Priestcraft. These are not the Dark Ages. John Adams, second President of the United States, wrote, "The question before the human race is, whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws, or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles?" Elbert Hubbard, American writer, publisher, artist, and philosopher, wrote "A miracle is an event described by those to whom it was told by people who did not see it." American Revolutionary War patriot and hero Ethan Allen wrote "In those parts of the world where learning and science have prevailed, miracles have ceased; but in those parts of it as are barbarous and ignorant, miracles are still in vogue."&&&2
Idaho less impressive upon closer inspection - Hawaii Sports&&&Dave, You pegged Hawaii at having a 5-8 season, and I a 8-5 season. I conceded to your wisdom, as the Warriors have been dismal the last three games. I picked one of Hawaii's wins against Fresno at home. Conversely, I picked Idaho to prevail since Idaho is an improved team and Hawaii traditionally sucks on the road. So.... I am hoping that you are right and I am wrong again. Man, anything for a win.&&&16

If they don't need it anymore..GIVE IT BACK to the taxpayers rather than just throw it down that rathole called BOE to fritter away.&&&29
Hawaii's tax burden ranks 24th in the U.S. - Hawaii Business&&&Taxes are only one part of the anti-business climate in Hawaii.

Over the same stretch, they have rushed 214 times (55% of the time) for 11 tds and are averaging 4.4 yards per carry! 3. Two Idaho RB's average over 6 ypc. This is not a passing team, son. Do your research and try again.&&&2
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Excellent letter, Jennifer Farhni, explaining that the title, Barbarian Princess, and Kaiulani, and the Scottish connection. Perhaps, Kaiulani was well educated, of the highest order, and was a privileged Princess of the Kingdom. But, not the common native Hawaiians under that corrupt kingdom of Hawaii. This modern day idolization of the alii basically glosses over just how corrupt the monarchy was. Some folks today want to romanticize how "great" the monarchy was, when in fact, it was rotten to the core, victimizing the commoners in, and since, the Mahele of 1848. My suggestion to you is that rather than being fixated on worshipping the foreign, european-import concept of "the monarchy" or "princesses" or that sort of non-sense, that you instead make positive use of your energy explaining how that form of government was used as an instrument by the privileged few to victimize, subjugate and ripp off the common native Hawaiian tenants in the Mahele of 1848. Can you do that? We've heard this rubbish about how great the alii over, and over, and over again. It's tiresome. Especially when the facts prove otherwise.&&&27

Suspect charged in tourist's death - Hawaii News&&&The Journal reported last week that Susa's father, Michael Susa, said his son grew up in Missouri. Susa came to Hawaii in 2005 for a vacation with his girlfriend. He said he never saw his son again and wondered if he was still alive. Susa had been in jail in Hawaii seven times since 2006 for probation violations for methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia possession. He was released from jail the day before Antone's body was found on the beach. So all this time he was here since 2005, the law enforcement or courts didnt bother to check where he was from and send him back with a one way ticket? Why did we have to keep him here and waste our tax dollars on him and eventually cause a senseless murder in Hawaii. Id say the family of the victim can sue the state of Hawaii for negligence.&&&47

This is like buying dollar bills with fives....the money is ALREADY out there in as yet to be collected TAXES. The difference is the transfer from taxpayers to the cronies of the mayor.&&&688

Rising rent worries Hawaii Kai farmers - Hawaii News&&&This is why landlords are unwilling to rent and correctly so. These farmers while doing a good thing by providing local produce now feel they own the property. Legislators get involved and play to the drama but at the end of the day the land owner is made out to be the bad guy. If I were Kamehameha I would dump the farmers now or at least make certain that they set the rules in stone otherwise come 2025 there will be a huge problem. There is truth in the fact that...NO GOOD DEED SHALL GO UNPUNISHED. No rental increases in 35 years, what do these people expect? Kamehameha better look for the grapes they are growing because there is about to be a harvesting of w(h)iners. Do not cower Kamehameha stop getting pushed around for the good you do and the wisdom of your holdings.&&&65
Black Eyed Peas to perform at Bayfest&&&My Fiance and I were two of the many persons who missed the concert and had the pleasure of sitting in the traffic generated by the Kaneohe Marine Corps bases single access point and bottle neck traffic control on post. We missed the concert in its entirety and still have our unused tickets. Since then I have contacted the Marine Corps Community Services office and was informed they plan not to refund or compensate anyone for their losses stating concert goers should have arrived when the venue opened. I made it clear to the Community Service office it would be ludicrous to expect concert goers to show up 6-8 hours early to wait in the heat, drinking $7 dollar beers and $3-6 dollar water for a concert. I was then informed by the Marine Corps Community Services office that the only way compensation or refunds would be issued is if the base Commander authorized refunds. I have since spoke with the Marine public affairs office and called the base Commanders office to inquire about the possibility of a refund. At this time there is no plan to refund or compensate wronged patrons. I have filed a formal complaint. I would recommend persons requesting a refund or compensation also fill out formal complaints. The link is as follows I hope this helps your readers get the reparations they deserve.&&&10

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Jane: From one who remembers the 1960s violence and anarchy of the time, if the anger, rumoring and divisiveness doesn't stop, we are doomed to repeat it. When I was in Ohio, I happened to hear an Ohio Congressman, Rep. Jim Jordan (R) 4th district of Ohio, in a party line call to constituents, refer to Glenn Beck and the Heritage Foundation as THE authorities on issues. I thought HE and other Congress people were the authorities we should be hearing, from their own mouths, not these second hand interlopers.&&&177
Hawaii not getting its money's worth for education - Guest Edit...&&&It looks like some teachers are feeling some heat for slamming the classroom door in the face of the kids on the furlough days. Let's be clear about this. Millions of workers have been forced to accept pay cuts. They keep the same job, and work the same number of hours, but take 20-30% lower pay. Even very powerful labor unions, like those in the automobile industry, have had to accept new contracts with reduced pay and/or reduced benefits. The teachers' union could have agreed to lower pay without cutting the number of school days. But they didn't. In fact, so far as I know, such a proposal was never even made by the Governor or the school board. That's because the teachers' union is politically powerful. So now the kids getting less classroom time, and their parents scrambling for daycare on furlough days, know whom to blame -- the teachers' union and the politicians. They deserve the public's outrage.&&&14

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Here we have college educated, professional, educators telling us we need to raise the regressive excise tax, in order to keep salaries to the UHPA intact. That just goes to show how ignorant about taxes and business they are. Most of these professors never had a real job in the economy in their lives. Their personal work resume looks like this: 1. Elementary school 2. middle school,3. High school: had a part time job for the summer, quit after 1 week (too hard work. 4. College: worked as a student aide on a full scholarship 5. Masters degree: worked as a TA for a professor in my major. 6.Doctorate: worked as an assistant professor in my field, upon completion of my Doctorate, ws hired by the University system as a professor. Where is the real life experiences of these professors? How can they relate to the real world. Their simplistic solution is to raise taxes.

Really?? It is worthwhile to add a childish superstition of Friday the 13th to this article?? Is that point *really* relevant? No, it isn't. Just a suggestion to refrain from adding pseudo-journalism remarks to your stories.&&&12
QB Colburn enhances Fresno State attack - Sports News&&&"QB enhances FS attack". Enhances probably wasn't the correct adjective. He was near perfect 12 for 14 is an 86% completion rate with 2 TD's. Combined that with Mathews and the rest of the Bulldog's rushing attack and they were an unstoppable force. To limit Mathews to "only" 142 yards is an accomplishment. Got to hand it to Coach Hill, he could have run the score up into the 60's. It's going to be a long season.&&&2

'Dogs have their day - Hawaii Sports&&&Another embarrassing loss this time at home. To think we had the best coach in UH history and lost him for Mack? how sad, UH better look into hiring a real coach and get a whole new coaching staff ( we have a few that can stay) I mean we pay over 1 million for mack and our defense still sucks. Going to be a long season and maybe we will get 4 or 5 wins.&&&9
Audit hits city's management of auto fleet as weak, inadequate ...&&&"may be "overstated" because the analysis was limited to only passenger vehicles and not the entire fleet." Right. I suspect if the audit had looked at the entire fleet the conclusions of the report would have been even more damning. "In addition, the report does not acknowledge steps that the city has already taken to address many of the findings of this report,". So let's think this through. We were doing a terrible job, then the investigation started, so we got worried and fixed a few things, but the report doesn't mention that we started fixing these few things after the investigation started so the Report should not be believed. What a risible defense of the incompetence that is standard practice for government since 1893.&&&22
UH fans can fall back on underwhelming positives - Further Review&&&More positives: - Aloha Stadium won't have to spend money watering the field for the next couple of days, AND, maybe the shadows of the Hawaii Bowl logo will finally wash away. - The offense has found a new way to score: Fumble for touchdown. Rolo is an offensive genius. - It's entertaining when Coach McMackin's shirt gets wet and starts sticking to his body.&&&3
'Dogs have their day - Sports News&&&I believe Hawaii has lots of great players this year, but what we lack is good coaching that culminates good talent into a good team. I never wanted MacMackin to take over for Jones. He's a nice guy but not a very good head coach. How many more seasons do we plan on investing in him before the decision makers realize Mac is taking us in the wrong direction.&&&8

As said or inferred times before, APOPHIS should best be considered a test of desired future "GLOBALISM" = OWG-NWO, i.e. the readiness + ability of world nations to WORK TOGETHER IN THE NAME AND BENEFIT, ETC.

Game statistics - Hawaii Sports&&&I see some promising stats. Leon rushed 5 times for 66 yds. Pretty good. Plus they brought out Chizzy. That means the coaches are not giving up on this year. Were going to red-shirt Chizzy but the coaching staff looks to open up the running game a bit more to take some pressure off of Moniz and to create some play-action in the Red.&&&1
Fresno never let Moniz get started - Sports News&&&I agree with Wazdat. This year is already a loss and also next year, maybe even the following year. You need to scrap the whole offensive and defensive scheme including finding a coach that can take it to a higher level. Mack is a nice guys but lack the ability of bringing the best out of the the players. Hawaii has alot of great players but guess where they go. The mainland-better competition.&&&5

How stupid and ridiculous is that? Take the lost to Kamehameha to beat Iolani. Who cares? I know Iolani spoiled St. Louis' season last year but to overlook a very good Kamehameha team is very stupid in my book.&&&1

Thin Hawaii budget inspires creative census promotions - Hawaii...&&&By talking to religious leaders, creating ads in public schools and handing out brochures, Hawaii is trying to stretch its thin budget to encourage participation in next year's census. What also needs to be done is to have people complete and return the form. The form is anonymous and no names are used. Hawaii received more than $1,200 per person in census-based federal money in 2007, which paid for a wide range of government services such as roads, homeless shelters, public housing, health care and education. The more people are counted, the more money Hawaii will receive. Among native Hawaiians, which make up a disproportionate share of the homeless, a better response to the census would bring more funding for beds and health services, said Momi Fernandez, director of Papa Ola Lokahi, the Hawaiian board of health. Fill out the form when you get it, not mabe later. You guys pay taxes might as well get something back. There is a provision for people in tents and campers as well. When you guys hear about the start of the census, call someone you trust to get counted. Besides look at all the post office jobs you can help save. Sen. Inouye is not going to be around forever.&&&1

UH should call timeout on wacky road schedules - Hawaii Sports&&&Amd what about the fans? By the time the Fresno game arrives on the calendar, it will have been five weeks since the first game with one of the three road trips a truly awful watching experience - jerky transmission and the worst case of "Homerism" I've ever heard from a broadcast team - while the second broadcat in Las Vegas forced thousands of UH fans to watch the game in sports bars. Anyhow, I agree with you that road trips should be better planned. I assume that this year's schedule came from Herman Frazier(sp) since non-conference games are scheduled years in advance.&&&46
Police commissioner quits over donation - Hawaii News&&&Yeah, Amemiya and Maafala like make "oh, nothing wrong. It's for the kids!" B.S. Of course, Amemiya getting cash from Maafala's SHOPO, and Amemiya voting against the former Chief, is connected. Only a moron would believe Maafala's account. True, everybody should kokua our public high schools. But this kine, right here, is uncool. The question is, how much good faith can we place in the City's Ethics people to actually effect a correct decision, when their administration is led by a crooked politician who sees no problem in lying to the general tax-paying public in a regular basis? I'm talking about Mufi and Yoshioka hiding a $500 million rail budget shortfall. I'm talking about Mufi hiding the almost $6 million in "rail" advertisement, funneled to cronies. With that kind of crooked leadership, I do not have ANY faith his City Ethics people going come up clean on this one neither.&&&31

Kulani prison closed out of fiscal necessity - Hawaii Editorials&&&Tommy, you are starting to believe the crappy rhetoric that you have been forced to espouse. Don't believe everything you say. You know that the mainland facilities only take the non-problem inmates and leave the high maintenence inmates for us to keep, so quit equating the daily cost to keep a high maintenence inmate here verses sending a low maintenence inmate to a mainland prison. And don't act like you never sent any of the kulani inmates to the mainland when you know that the closing of kulani has brought our local levels of inmates to the brink of maximum capacity, and that you will have to send other inmates to the mainland or to the Federal Detention Center. Quit trying to fool the public, you're not going to get the Diredtors job under the next governor anyway, none of you that blindly support this naive governor have a career after she is gone, because you have betrayed the rank and file workers for your shortterm personal gain. The gig is almost up, 2010 is just around the corner, and the piper will have to be paid.&&&20

What Prep Bowl are you referring to that Kahuku lost by not having a kicker? The '95 Prep Bowl with Doug Semones as coach? St Louis had the better team that year.

Disabled park for free because of meter design - Columnists&&&I can understand the part of the disabled being unable to feed the meters, yet, most of the automobiles that have the temporary disabled stickers, have someone other than the disabled person driving the vehicle. Are you trying to tell me, that, because the passenger is disabled, they get to park free? The State and Counties should collect a fee from the persons at the time of applying for the permit, asking the disabled person on the application if they will be driving the car exclusively or will they have a driver. They should also have a doctors certification stating that the handicapped person can actually drive. If they have a driver then they will be mandated to pay a fee for the sticker. If they are able to walk, then they should be able to pay for the meter. I have seen too many so called disabled getting prime parking they don't deserve.&&&19

Yes, they still haven't got a clue how they are the reason for our state's poor economic condition, funding so many non essential programs that waste tax dollars. Ann couldn't budget if you gave her a step by step guide. Owner occupants need a lower tax without bureaucrats dreaming up other taxes for their union bosses to waste money on. When will they get it? Never as long as they are union lap dogs, oblivious to how hard taxpayers have it. Ahhhh, another day in the Nei.&&&17

After more than 65-years of the temporary presence of American Forces in Europe and Japan, may federal workers have married locals, bought homes, raised children and remained in the federal workforce in these places -despite the on and off enforcement of five-year rotation agreements. Since everything is so global today, why can federal retirement parity be global was well?&&&15

If the State wants to do this by themselves, the cost would be more since the payment to the investors will include federal credits.&&&8

UH faculty voting on 'final offer' - Hawaii News&&&C'mon UH-no more money for your faculty? Deprive education to young adults? What's you plan? Go to the state for funds and yet will not manage your resources to the fullest extent? Taxpayers have been made a fool of for too long. The amount of land that you have under your control is outrageous. Somebody is making a pretty penny at our expense and without our knowledge. The residents of this state must demand that the legislature take back the power to control that PUBLIC institution. The claims of having to "scale back" programs to save money is bogus. This situation is almost ditto to the issue with the public education system except that the BOE/DOE have no other resources other than to be at the mercy of the legislators and their meager funding that "trickles" down to benefit the keiki. Ask the faculty of UH-they know all about the corruption that occurs there-at ANY campus! nuff said&&&31

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Health care needed for all Bambi Lin Litchman Honolulu NO BAMBI LIN LITCHYMAN WE OPPOSE THE "OBAMACARE" SOCIALISTIC HEALTH CARE PLAN. HEALTH CARE IS NOT NEEDED FOR ALL WHAT ABOUT THE 20 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE USA? WHAT ABOUT YOU PEOPLE WHO DO NOT CARE OR WANT TO PAY FOR A HEALTH CARE PLAN? DO THEY DESERVE FREE HEALTH CARE . WE SAY NO Health care plan opposed After being a dues-paying member of AARP for more than 16 years, I submitted my resignation on July 28. AARP has taken the wrong course by going out and supporting Obamacare and by aiding President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in their drive to socialize our health care system. Records indicate that A. Barry Rand, the CEO of AARP, gave $4,600 for the president’s campaign committee in 2008 plus another $4,300 to Barack Hussein Obama’s victory fund. AARP’S continued blind support of Obamacare or the plan to socialize our health care system, which works perfectly well now, could be the death of this organization. They promise seniors high-quality care, but in reality, Obamacare will be nothing more than long waits for critical appointments with medical specialists like in Great Britain, Canada and other countries. Wake up, people, and realize that AARP supports socialized medical care, which will surely fail if and when ramroded through Congress.

Watada victory bittersweet - Hawaii Editorials&&&"But it's unrealistic to expect any softening from many Iraq veterans or their families. By describing the war as illegal, Watada essentially called into question the service of those who did follow orders." The Iraq War, the invasion, and the current occupation have no support outside of a very small segment of the US population; the Brits and Romania are bailing on the "Coalition of the Willing," leaving the US alone to its adventure. Withdrawn to the Green Zone and isolated from the Iraqi people, the land, and Iraq's fate, US forces are dug in for an interminable stay, shoring up perimeter defenses around the most massive embassy/consulate structure in the world. Watada saw the handwriting on the wall early on and dared to confront the war, which most of the rest of the world saw as a cynical expression of the neoconservative vision for a realigned Middle East. Apologists for the war, many of them the unquestioning service members who pursued the war, will be bitter in their feelings towards Watada because to admit that he may be right means that at best they were duped and at worst morally wrong to have participated in this ruinous war. They will hate him as many Vietnam vets hate Jane Fonda and Daniel Ellsberg. They will bear that bitterness as long as they cannot open themselves to the truth that the war was based on lies, carried on through corruption and fraud, and dragged on long after ALL other nations in the world left the scene.&&&83

In defense of taking land for public use - Hawaii Editorials&&&This isn't the easiest editorial to read and understand, but the basic message is correct. That is, Hawaii's Supreme Court is full of idiots who have no clue what they are doing. Obviously the Supremes have never been stuck in traffic trying to drive through Kona - like I have.(After all, driving is something only the "little people" do.) If they had, then they would realize that any kind of new road in the Kona area would be a welcome addition and relief. It is hard to think of a more valid reason for the public taking of private land. If this is how the Supreme Court thinks then Mayor Mufi can kiss his rail project goodbye. The Supreme Court is simply unrelenting in its efforts to make Hawaii a lousy place to live. Those efforts include contributing to past corruption at Bishop Estate, killing the SuperFerry and, just a couple of days ago, ruling in support of reckless speeding on our highways. It is certainly discouraging when a group of people who are supposed to be the wisest among us are, instead, the biggest fools.&&&9
Evidence must be flawless - Hawaii Editorials&&&This is pathetic. Now the SB is standing up in defense of people who race their cars up and down our freeways endangering motorists around them. Everyone else understands that this whole case is just public defenders, the bottom feeders of the judicial system, offering up one lame excuse after another to get their defendants off. This has nothing to do with justice, the public interest or making Hawaii a better place to live. What's next? Once the police testify they were properly trained then the public defender will argue there is no evidence that the laser gun manufacturer was qualifed to train the officers. While we are at it, let's throw out all school test scores because there's no evidence the authors of those tests were properly qualified. And let's throw out all election results because maybe poll workers weren't all trained the right way. Get real idiots. If Abiye Assaye was doing 90 in a 55 you don't even need a laser gun to tell he should have his car confiscated and his license revoked. Our legal system is not supposed to be a game where morally challenged attorneys try to outsmart dim-witted judges. It might seem all in good sport to con some judges into letting your client go, but when someone dies a horrible death in a crash caused by that same reckless speeder (who the public defender put back on the road) then it is definitely going to stop being funny.&&&17
Big Isle and Kauai sales up, but home prices decrease - Hawaii ...&&&It's ok. The median price for a home on Kauai is $499k while the median income is <$50k. In order to qualify for a $499k home under current rules your income would need to be over $125k/year...pricing out the police officers, firefighters, teachers and just about everyone who works for a living. When a PAID "living wage" is compatible with the cost to live here in paradise, then and only then will be have real aloha. What we have now and have had in the last 20years is the investor class ruling the housing market. Yes there is only one Hawaii but the people that live and work in Hawaii must be paid enough to actually sustain themselves. I'm glad prices are falling even though I'd like to sell and move to a newer home. I won't however afford the median price and therefore am like the majority stuck in the subjugated rut that as been placed on the majority by the investor class who have little interest in Hawaii or it's people other than making the almighty buck and moving to the next score.&&&2

State health plan could save millions - Hawaii News&&&we really need to stop supporting outsiders, we can barely take care of our own local people, many of these people have kids year after year and can barely afford to feed them, is that our problem? NO. They need to be taught the motto "cant feed em, dont breed em" human services should step in when the mothers are on their 4th to 5th kids, If you can support your kids fine have as many as you want but a majority of them are using state funded monies to offset costs. enough is enough. It is time to stop feeling sorry for them and start educating them that there is a price to pay, this goes for the local people also that are creating babies just to collect that extra welfare check, if you have 3 or more kids and are collecting welfare and have another Kid, all the kids should be taken away, parents put in jail and money that should have gone to parents be given to foster parents.&&&25
Destruction and death left in wake - Hawaii News&&&Earthquakes of this magnitude and greater are on the horizon, especially on oceanic crust plates throughout the world. It's because of several reasons which ignorant and arrogant scientists will disagree based on their egotistic stupidity. The first major cause of these sea quakes is because of excessive pressure on thin oceanic crusts from increased sea levels from massive melting of both polar ice caps and other higher elevational glacial areas. The thin oceanic crusts are much more suspectable to this increased pressure than the thick continential crusts. Secondly, it is caused by mankind's overpopulation increasing at a rate of 200 million each year and it's unstainable quest for more exploitation of Earth's capacity to maintain equalibrium. Thus the Earth itself is reacting to mankind's insane negative inputs of excessive CO2/pollutants, destruction of natural habitats, destruction of its ozone. Unfortunately more human lives will be lost because of human stupidity of not maintaining an optimal population level of 529 million for a planet this size. Then of course, it is nature's way of equalizing such negative influences, because the chances of positive changes will NOT occur due to mankind's undisciplined nature, more disasters of greater magnitude will occur. More volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, storms and lastly, an major asteriod impact is due in 2010. This is NOT some event due to religious nature, although these equally stupid religious leaders will jump at any opportunity to promote their brain-washed attitudes, but a cause and effect relationship between nature itself.&&&40
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Have parents subsidize teacher pay" They already do, it is called TAXES. Rather than pay MORE how about they spend what they get more WISELY.

Kauai tours allow clients to see 'light in our lives' - Travel&&&Here's another haole using her own interpretation and calling it Hawaiian. Then she goes so far as to SELL this thing of hers as medicinal/healing. That is so wrong it makes me sick to my stomach. That is what haole do when they cannot survive in their own birth land. They come to Hawaii and crap on our culture then sell it to other haole as the cure. How come she cannot be a healer where she comes from? I'd bet those people of her birth place could use her healing too.&&&5
Military's mission of aid - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Military's mission of aid" Let's hear it for the military !! I don't see China, Korea, Russia or any other country offering aid to Samoa except the U.S. Military. Yet not one single post about it. It's ok so I will say, job well done.&&&5
Economic benefits short in building on farm land - Hawaii Features&&&The professors make some very good and valid points. How do we balance food and shelter needs? While I don't think anyone would argue that food self sufficiency is desireable, how many of us (myself included) support the concept with our wallets? How many of us grab the local tomato over the mainland tomato, even though it's double the price? The same can be said with eggs or lettuce. A farmer will only grow what the market will buy. Once the market is not willing to pay the price, the farmer will either grow something else or go out of business (e.g. poultry farms or commodity milk dairies on Oahu). A scarcity of farmable land on Oahu is an issue. However, it is only one. Lack of economies of scale puts local farmers at a disadvantage as does the high cost of doing busieness and the lack of able and willing workers. In addition, the state is now ending feed subsidies, which sounds the death knell for many more poultry and livestock farmers. The very best way to help out local agriculture is to buy local produce, even if it costs more. If we don't buy it, farmers will not grow it. Support Local Agriculture!!&&&2
As Galveston recovers from ike, some residents feel left behind...&&&Hurricanes are to be expected in Galveston; history has proved it over and over again. I have no pity on these people who whine and whine when their uninsured homes get damaged by the weather...sorry! The deficit spending clowns in Clowngress can't cough up the money for the handouts to these generally less than thoughtful people here, and "borrowing" (more like "stealing") the money from us, our children, our grandchildren is robbing from Peter to pay Paul for something that is expected to happen over and over again. When are WE, the people going to quit paying for stupidity? Probably never...stupidity always trumps being prudent in this Dumocrappic nation...oh well!'Nuff said...&&&3

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"American Clean Energy and Security Act" More commonly known as "Cap and trade". First off, when current power production fails to meet carbon limits they have to pay for credits or fines...which means WE will be paying since they wil not just eat those costs. On top of that WE will be paying for all that nice new green energy. In essence we get to pay TWICE. Waxman is nitwit. The best policy would be to give breaks to any power company going to green energy not fines for NOT using it. This may not be a tax on the middle class but we certainly will be shouldering the bills for this. Bad bill, bad time to even consider it.&&&9

Jason was concerned for the safety of his son. Jason was concerned for his own safety too. Now, Jason is gone and his son is back with the woman he had told us was dangerous. Why? Is Jason silent in death? Doesn't the circumstances speak for itself. Why are the police letting this go?&&&2

Prosecutor decries court ruling on speeding - Hawaii News&&&Couple of things come to mind. Let's say for the sake of argument that the laser was not correctly calibrated. Part of the training for using speed detection devices is a field test where the trainee must correctly estimate a vehicle's speed within +/- 5 mph and with a minimum score of 90%. In other words, a certified operator(s) of a speed detection device can usually observe the violation visually before checking the actual speed with laser or radar. This is not rocket science. Most people, at least the ones who are actually practicing defensive driving and watching for the actions of other drivers and other potential hazards, are able to see the drivers who are speeding and making unsafe lane changes. But I digress. The proof that a manufacturer sets guidelines for calibrating speed detection devices prior to deployment is in the operating manual supplied with the equipment. A simple fix called "Exhibit A." So let's say this driver was "only" doing 80 instead of 90 or for that matter, 70 mph. That's still at least 25 mph over the speed limit and way too fast. My point? This person decides to take this to the Supreme Court. For what? To make a point? To exercise a Constitutional right? Or maybe just contempt for authority? I don't know but it reminds of that guy in California who also took his case to the Supreme Court because his daughter was "forced" to say "Under God" during the Pledge of Allegiance at her school. Pay the ticket and thank God you didn't kill someone.&&&15

Star-Bulletin football and volleyball Top 10 - Hawaii Sports&&&How is it that Kahuku is in Division 1 for girls volleyball? Weren't they in Division 2 for girls basketball last year? What's the difference? You can't say it has to do with the number of girls on the team because it is roughly the same for the two sports. I doubt the student enrollment has suddenly increased. This is just another example of how OIA schools manipulate the two division system to give some of their schools an advantage by dropping down to Division 2 for better shots at state titles - in this case girls basketball. Iolani in the ILH is also guilty of doing this with football. Schools should be forced to choose one division and stick with it for all their sports. All you haters can slam Punahou all day long but they NEVER move down to Division 2 in an attempt to get a cheap shot at a state title.&&&26

Stitch in time - Hawaii Features&&&I am proud not only Rosa-lou shop was once a part of Hawaii's known resort dresses but also in helping a lot of Filipino. I take this pride not only as a Filipino but a close relative of Rosalie Cadiz. My mom ( Felixta Cadiz Avila+)was once a purchaser. She (Rosalie) had to asked her to buy barong and other items here in the Philippines to be sent to Hawaii. I used to help my mother in packaging those items. I knew since early 1970 that Rosa-lou shop had been serving its clientele qulity products from the Philippines. It is already a legend and a part of Hawaii's culture. And I am proud that Filipino dresses were being patronized not only fellow Filipino. I am hoping that Rosa-lou shop will continue providing quality dresses designed and originated from the Philippines. Their kindness and generosities will be forever be treasured in our hearts.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Sylvia Mitchell has it upside down. She proudly cheers on coward Ehren Watada, who abandoned his troops, disregarded his sworn Oath, and who lied to himself and dishonored his Family name, forever. You see, to swear a solemn Oath, only to abandon that duty, while running and hiding under an argument that a particular conflict is "illegal" in order to avoid combat and conceal cowardice, requires a level of dishonesty and lying to ones self. Mitchell not only endorses that dishonest conduct by Watada, she astonishingly also celebrates and cheers such cowardice on! Yet, it is from that dishonest point of view that Mitchell wants us to join in her orgy of self-delusion, and abandon our common sense. Rather than writing letters to the Editor proving how stupid she can be, Mitchell herself can go down to the Natatorium and count the number of Lives lost in that World War I, that she can discover far exceeds her misrepresentation of "6." To cite a publication with "information" created in 1998, then skew that information so as to mislead the general public readers here, to devalue the Lives lost and Sacrifices made in the WWI, is something Mitchell is quite comfortable with. Whether Hawaii residents before the WWI or not, those Names represent real human beings, who walked this Earth, who believed so much in what these United States of America are all about, that they gave it their all, laid down their lives, so that we may enjoy the Blessings of such Liberty they fought and died for. Blessings that folks like Watada and Mitchell do not deserve for such disrespect towards their fellow soldiers of the present, and the Veterans and their memories of the past.&&&31

Farrington gets homecoming on home field after all - Hawaii Sports&&&I don't see how this would give the Gov's the advantage playing on "home field." No matter where they play it really isn't a "home" game. So why not help your fans out by going somewhere where they can be accomidated. There's no parking for one thing, and also both Farrington and Kahuku bring really big crowds. Where's everybody gonna park? Where's everybody gonna sit??? That stadium only holds 4,000. And the stands hold both teams. I'll be very surprised if a fight doesn't break out. Mr. Tanaka, you are the OIA football coordinator and the AD for Farrington. Why would you schedule to play Kahuku for the biggest turnout of your entie season, knowing that Roosevelt's field is not equiped to hold that many people. Forget your pride, and think of the safety of everyone that'll be there at the game.&&&4

HMC weighs sale of Liliha hospital - Hawaii Business&&&I worked at St. Francis MC from 1991-2001, until I was terminated and was compelled to write to the board of directors regarding the mismanagement in the department in which I worked. It involved an illegal relationship with my department manager and the union which represented our occupation. After filing a complaint with the NLRB, I was tricked by the HR manager into dropping my complaint in exchange for a "voluntary resignatinon". The manager was later let go as well. There has been too many skeletons in SFMC's past which indicate a lack of real integrity and quality business management over the years. Things never have changed there, except maybe their name...&&&2

Honolulu film premiere of 'By the People: The Election of Barack Obama'&&&Antibirthers are rude and insulting because of their fear the Chicago thug Obama really is hiding information deeming him ineligible to run for president. If he has nothing to hide why is he hiding it? Why are there so many people concerned about this issue? Could they all be racist, ignorant nutjobs? Some who come to mind are: Pat Boone, Chuck Norris, Alan Keyes, Dr. Michael Savage, Jerome Corsi, Rush Limbaugh, senators, congressmen, attorneys, and military officers. They and I all take our Constitution seriously & put our hand over our hearts when the National Anthem is played(unlike the Obama). It is a travesty that anyone, especially a man some people refer to as "president ", should be allowed to blatantly violate the law of the land. Remember when those same antibirther-types ridiculed Linda Tripp, Paula Jones & a host of others when Clinton was impeached?

Punahou keeps Kamehameha on its slide - Sports News&&&It's too bad you focused on the negatives of Kamehameha's week instead of the positives of hard working athletes at Punahou who show up for games after getting up very early commuting from all parts of the island (including Kahuku),study and work out with their coaches just like Kamehameha students athletes and actually win the games they work so hard for. Punahou students are hard working just like their blue collor and white collar parents. The difference is a private trust pays the tuition of one and the other is paid for by their families and a few scholarship awards. Give credit where it is due, keep the negatives somewhere else.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Hey ...George L. Berish. Why even write a letter to the editor if you have nothing truthful or realistic to say? "naively falling on your political swords to save him?" Naive, really? You must mean like naive Republicans who believe that they can launch wars which will result in "nation building" in two of the places on Earth least likely to ever allow that to happen?(Iraq & Afghanistan) "and a mop to clean up his economic and security messes"? Seriously? Obama's mess? George, you know your historical-amnesia should really be checked out by a professional as soon as possible.&&&77
Syngenta buys Kunia land for $14M&&&This is going backwards. The future is in organic farming. Hawaii imports too much food. This company is growing a produce no one in Hawaii can eat. GMO food needs to be labeled so Hawaii residents are informed and have the choice to eat Muntant GMO produce or not.&&&13

Hilo Hattie forges ahead with reorganization - Hawaii Business&&&"In a message to customers, Kang said his vision is to provide the largest selection of made-in-Hawaii fashions and gifts, including an expanded line of children's apparel." Sounds like a good plan, exactly what HH started out doing way back when. You could buy the made in asia junk they were recently selling at just about any flea market. Good luck Kang, I hope you make it work.&&&4

Pet Ohana - Hawaii Features&&&I hope everyone is aware of the bill in Congress sponsored by Thaddeus McCotter (MI)to allow taxpayers to deduct up to $3500 in pet care expenses. It is called the Happiness bill and everyone that has a pet should call or write their Congress persons to support this bill so we can get a deduction for our pets healthcare.&&&1
Taking time for exercise can boost work quality - Hawaii Features&&&I happened to meet Ruth Wong on a flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles. I was fascinated by the book "Brain Rules" that she was reading and I talked to her for some time. She was a fascinating woman and a pleasure to talk to. I could not have had a better flight than the one with her.&&&1
Petty politics over prison - Hawaii Editorials&&&This is yet another example of the perplexing leadership of the Lingle Administration! Too many of Hawaii's inmates are shipped to the mainland where Hawaii's taxpayers are employing workers living in another state. Build the prison in Hawaii and use our tax dollars for our state!&&&23
Tsunami warning worked - Hawaii Editorials&&&The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) issued email alerts to subscribers as well as posting the text of those warnings on their website. The alerted a vast area of the Pacific that they were either under a watch or warning and promised hourly (or more frequent if the situtation dictated) updates until there was evidence of no tsuanmi (all clear). That didn't happen, the first update appeared ahead of schedule with updated data on the magnitude. Nothing else was posted until the all clear was given at 11:47AM. I'm wondering why they failed to keep all of the Pacific updated on a hourly (of more frequent) basis as promised. Not that these warnings would have helped the people of Samoa but the rest of the Pacific was relying on these updates in order to make their own decisions about protecting their residents.&&&12
Police Cite Dog Walkers Along Kapiolani Park&&&It's about time! When are they coming to my neighborhood?&&&8
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Debbie Shimuzu letter to the editor is misleading in a number of ways. First, it suggests that people having children are incapable of raising their children. This is untrue. Then it states that there are thousands of children without sufficient health insurance. This is also untrue as there are many programs, including SHIC and Medicaid, that provide health care to children in families making as much as $80,000 dollars a year. This is just another liberal misleading the public in order to line their pockets.&&&4
Family sues Hilton over man's death - Hawaii News&&&"against the Hilton for failing to provide warning signs to recreational users about the strong suction of the drain and neglecting to make the lagoon safe." They have signs, "swim at your own risk"....pretty much sums it all up...I suppose they could erect billboard sized signs listing every possible risk but saying "at your own risk" seems to cover it for me. No problem, I am sure they are only suing to teach Hilton a lesson, the dollars involved mean squat..right?&&&26

Kapu ends midday run at KINE-FM - Hawaii Features&&&Enjoyed listening to you on the radio all these years. Everything was casual and easy going which made for a relaxing late morning and early afternoon time listening on the radio. "You gotta feel Aloha" song by the Naluai brothers was the perfect way to start your radio show because it was such an upbeat feeling which you continued on your radio show. Happy "retirement" bruddah Sam!&&&2

Haili's Hawaiian Foods to reopen in Kapahulu - Hawaii Business&&&Great to see a long time small business move forward in these very trying times. And to top it off they (Haili's)must really "Live ALOHA", as they have also kept their empolyees...something we don't often see in the world of big business... I for one hope that Haili's open their NEW doors within the next 45days as I'll be visiting and would love to stop by for some ono kaukau. And just as a reminder, we should always SUPPORT ALL SMALL BUSINESS.&&&12
Firing of immigrant workers divides Los Angeles&&&Good. They should be fired. I bet that there are actual U.S. citizens who would appreicate any job. Of course, this means the employer must follow hard won labor law and pay fair wages. Outsourcing jobs right here at home has to stop. Illegals should be deported. The employer that hires illegals should be fined. End of story.&&&4
Days off will harm educational objectives - Hawaii Editorials&&&Thomas Hiltner doesn't understand that child care IS NOT the responsibility of taxpayers. It belongs to the parents. OK, 17 days of no school are thrust upon the parents. Funny how no complaints for other times there is no school as in Holidays or summer break. Parents are responsible for their children's related expenses, not taxpayers. What part of that doesn't Thomas Hiltner understand?&&&26
Costly disaster - Hawaii Features&&&I guess here in the United States we'll call it Hyundai and wonder why it was named after a car&&&1
Warrior replay - Hawaii Sports&&&This loss should be handed to whoever made the schedule. I saw the first two games in person. The Warriors came out ready to play and had a surgical offense. But you can't be on the road for a month and do well...everybody needs their own bed to sleep in. Travel takes its toll. It's obvious that coach doesn't use halftime to make adjustments. He gets out-coached in the second half EVERY game. Great guy, but born to be a co-ordinator, not a head coach. He should enjoy this one experience while it lasts...he won't get another D-1 job...especially after his 'mahu' comments national exposure.&&&2

Southern discomfort - Hawaii Sports&&&No Tackleing, could not stop the run, red zone problems at the end of the first half, the list is long. And the hit to Alexander I feel was legal, sorry Warriors going to be a long season. Now GO VT, hea I live here so got to root for Tech.&&&47
Injury to Alexander puts Moniz in the spotlight - Sports News&&&The schedule maker did the Warriors in this year (3) road games in a row is brutal. On the 3rd road game in a row teams only carry a winning %%% of 20% that is nationwide both college and pros. Unfortunately it was on the national tube where everyone is going to load up on the running game against us now, run run run; then pass if you have too.&&&2
Dino-mite! - Hawaii Features&&&Yes. The days of old when the dinosaurs roamed and ruled the Earth. So too, at the early dawn of mankind, arising from the primordial swamp teeming with microbial bacteria, first appeared the cro-magnon, cave-man, proudly displaying his forehead cerebral ridge. Only to be later elected: Mayor of Honolulu.&&&1
Firing of immigrant workers divides Los Angeles - Hawaii News&&&"Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, called the dismissals "devastating," and his office has insisted that the federal government should focus on employers that exploit their workers. American Apparel has been lauded by city officials and business leaders for paying well above the garment industry standard, offering health benefits and not long ago giving $18 million in stock to its workers." Super, get rid of the illegals and let citizens do the work then. The only thing the illegals provide is a drain on resources and cheap labor...neither of which we need.&&&22
2 state agencies provide tips on leasing farmland - Kokua Line&&&If biking, skateboarding, skating on the sidewalk in Waikiki are all prohibited, it's time we see something done about it -- happens every day, every night, and I've yet to see someone stopped by an officer even when one is right there. I live and work in Waikiki and this is a daily problem for pedestrians, not only on the sidewalks, but in the crosswalks. Boarders and cyclists alike will whiz through groups of people with no warning. It's a miracle no one has been seriously hurt yet. You can't hear them coming up behind you and they just don't seem to care.&&&1

What are the real reasons for closing Kulani? - Guest Editorials&&&Right on Kat! The Lingle administration is following the Republican't party line - pro big business, anti-civil rights and putting private monied interests over the common good. On the national level, privitization of military functions in Iraq, got us the many scandals and abuses that have surfaced about Black Water(now morphed into Xe Services LLC) and Haliburton. But apparently private interests are more important to Gov. Lingle and her Republican'ts than the public good. Keep the faith Kat. Many of us are with you.&&&6

Island images - Hawaii News&&&Cargo and fishing nets were at one time made of hemp; these would eventually degrade and disappear rather than last forever as do the nylon nets. The science is not complete on the final situation that is created by the physical breakup up of nylon and other plastics. It appears that these materials may stay around interminably in a nano state of extremely small, discrete particles that may damage organisms in ways not understood. So much for making hemp (cannibis) illegal and substituting petroleum based products for its share in paint, rope, net, clothing, paper, and untold other applications.&&&2
Short snaps: UH vs. LaTech - Hawaii Sports&&&Agreed. There are way more important things than Football. But this one was a real bad loss. I read that the players did not "show up." Maybe La Tech was that much better. Let's give them credit for the win.&&&1
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"she can't then blame him for anything as he did President Bush for everything." Oh I don't know, I have a feeling the far left will be blaming Bush for everthing for the next century... Does the UN have teleprompters? I think so....he should do well there.&&&5

Monday Night Lights in Hawaii? - Hawaii Sports&&&HSTA don't make any sense, they have saturday games going on with no furloughs at the present time and now they going to have furloughs on fridays they can't have football on fridays and saturday? Why is HSTA holding our kids hostage for their agenda? HSTA needs to be a team players and quit being self centered about their agenda. If the rest of the nation can make sacrifices, why can't Hawaii do the same? Are they someone special that they can't follow the rest of the nation? That's why I say Hawaii never thinks outside of the box. Where's the Aloha that Hawaii always talk about? Oh that right this is different, it HSTA! They're the people who loves thier contract and raises, but don't want to do their drug tests :-(.&&&20

Heat's on over trash - Hawaii Editorials&&&As long as corporations are allowed to externalize all the "disposal" costs associated with products that they mass market to consumers the garbage/waste problem will not be solved. The image of Hawaii's garbage sailing into the sunrise is a foul one, but it does reflect a certain reality in that a lot of the trash is generated by the tourists who come here. For an overview of the cycle that waste is a part of, Google 'The Story of Stuff" and spend a few minutes watching an entertaining and informative video on the subject. Here is the link; sometimes posted links do not work, so sorry if it is a dud.&&&13

Imagine liberal politican wanting to put US citizens in Jail if they dont buy Health Insurance.&&&27
It's all in the ohana for Higgins - Hawaii Sports&&&Jimmy Higgins walked on at UH. Played DL. He wasn't recruited to play there. He started out at Punahou, 3 years behind Barry ("Barack") Obama, but ended up playing for Ron Lee at Kaiser. I'm not going to say why he nevah went finish Punahou.&&&4

Firing of immigrant workers divides Los Angeles - New York Times&&&I think American Apparel is making the right decision by firing the ILLEGALS! My question is why hasn't the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, known as ICE, made any arrests or deported those found to be ILLEGAL. Is this another one of dictator hussein obama's lip service??? As far as LA Mayor antonio villaraigosa, he would always favor immigrants from down south, illegal or otherwise.&&&9
Whatever Happened To... - Hawaii News&&&Whatever happened to the embezzlement case Candace Joaquin vs Napilihau Resort a couple of years ago. She embezzled over 80,000K, second embezzlement offense first in the 80's for over 250K Kahului Bank. Was she sentenced? Where?&&&1
Audience-jury gives '16th' verdict - Hawaii Features&&&I starred in this play back in high school decades ago. Had no idea until a few weeks ago when the publicity about this production started who the playwright was. Ayn Rand was definitely not on my radar in high school although I did read her novels in college in literature classes a couple of years later. Later in graduate school, I studied her writings in political science classes In fact, I never again heard about the play between back then and today. Why would any theatrical group put it on today.&&&1
Polanski victim again in spotlight - Hawaii News&&&Polanski drugged and raped a 13 year old girl and ran away from his sentencing. If the LA justice department does not go after him no matter how long ago it sends the wrong message to others. If you can escape to France yuou are home free. He committed a serious crime in our country. If he did it today he would get at least 10 years, and be put on the sexual child molester list for ever. His celebrity status makes no difference nor the fact he settled with the now 40 year old woman from Kauai. Anybody that rapes little girls is a child molester and can never be rehabilitated, we all know that too well. Who cares if he is a award winning director. Justice is the subject and you get what you deserve and in this case it came 30 something years later.&&&26
Offbeat lawmaker is a true survivor - Hawaii News&&&and he is supposed to be a model for our students and this is suppose to be an examplar of character and high values....oh, please....i have children of my own and he is exactly what I don't want my kids to emulate.....give me a break....i'm not a liberal basher etc. but I do know what I want from my children and this legislator is certainly polar opposites of what our kids should be emulating in society....give me a break....is this what society and education is all about...and you wonder why there is so much problems in society .....&&&36

Natatorium vote prudent - Hawaii Editorials&&&Ridiculous that its taken this long to reach the natural conclusion that this crumbling, unusable relic needs to be replaced. Yeah, it will be missed. My own father learned to swim there when he was a child. Every local person has a connection to it in one way or another. But lets face the facts: no tourists are coming to Hawaii to visit it, no locals are using it for its purpose, it attracts vandals and drunks, and its a complete waste of money to restore it. Tear it down!&&&20

Former UH player is indicted in tax fraud - Hawaii News&&&You dead meat sucka! The Tax Man don't play.&&&38
Struggling to keep tabs on paroled offenders - Hawaii News&&&Makes you wonder, doesn't it? In Hawaii, the step father of my husband's daughter was convicted and put in prison for a year in 2004. He lost his job, home and marriage too. But then he gets out in 2005, is on parole for 5 years and during this time starts a new business taking videos at children's parties with a different name and when we ask the prosecutor's office about this, they tell us we need to "let it go". That's why we moved to Canada. Because we don't trust the legal system. This is someplace he will not be able to come to. They don't allow convicted felons to cross the border. Something is seriously wrong with how they track and monitor sex offenders, not just in Hawaii but throughout the US.&&&4
Warriors get taste of Texas - Hawaii Sports&&&Headcoach McMackin's sense of responsibility, concerns and actions speak volumes of his determination to lead this Hawai'i Warriors Football team into Joe Aillet Stadium and depart with a WAC WIN. Throw in the fact that the game will be Nationally televised too? Yeah, this game is huge. The Players see it, the UH coaching staff senses it and the Aloha State anticipates it. It's a business trip. What else could it be? We're talking Ruston here (no offense). So, I concur with HC McMackin's "okole-kicking side" attitude. This game need not be close! Since ESPN2 will cover the game, LaTech's HC Dooley has reached out to BULLDOG NATION to show up in force, wearing RED. LaTech has also invited the Grambling State students (GSU is located in Ruston too) to the game (free) to help fill the stands. Nice (not). It's going to be hostile. The Mission is clear. The Hawai'i Football Warriors MUST WIN PERIOD. I will be there with WARRIOR NATION in GREEN! Let's Go to WAR-riors!&&&10

Fluffy man, fluffy. Hethcote never intended to live in the home or pay off the mortgage. She received a fee of between $12,000 and $15,000.

Teachers' contract calls for 7.9 percent pay cut via furloughs&&&Remember all that striking back in the days of Felix-Waihee because you deep down felt that those snowbird DOH contractor worker were getting way more than you were? Remember what I wrote about the fat little spoiled brats sitting around the table furtively eyeing each other's ice cream dish to see who got more before digging in. Well...there is always one kid that goes slower and has all of his or her ice cream in the dish whilst the others did truly gobble down everything in front of them with their moths wide open and their eyes sealed shut....

Kandoo sinking - Hawaii News&&&To this day they have still not made good on pay checks that bounced and pay checks they owe for the last week before the lay off. I hope someone follows up on these guys because it seems to me at this point they are planning on starting up again. spending money they don't have on insurance instead of taking care of the people who wasted their time working for them they are liars and should be sent back to Arizona. That is if Arizona wants them back after the life lock scandal.&&&1
State lawmakers in reserves, guard get taste of war - Hawaii News&&&You want a taste of war? War tastes like the blood of your family members spilled by strangers. War tastes like starvation when crops are destroyed. War tastes like devastation of culture. War DOES NOT taste like glory-pics in the paper. At least not to some.&&&5
Sharing of faith - Hawaii News&&&This is a travesty towards those of other religions. We are a Christian nation and yet Hawaii has no plans for intiating a Christian Day, that would be too controversial. Our legislators came up with the idea themselves, without any public input. They obviously are practicing for the big day when then move to Washington. Had this day been set aside as a Religious Day, it would have been inclusive for all religions. Shame on those who fail to recognize the obvious discrimination. Now one religion is being given preference over another. Where is the separation of church and state?&&&89

Growing up in Hawaii did not really know racial prejudice with hatred until I got drafted in the Army in 1967 and went to the mainland for basic training at Ft. Ord and Ft. Polk. There and in Vietnam I witnessed how Blacks, Whites, and Mexicans were sometimes really prejudice with hate against each other.&&&12
Environmental Council defers further work - Hawaii News&&&Looks like the Ainokea Club has struck again. You have to wonder why nobody on the council can figure out how to take minutes for themselves. Grabowsky is a professor and former chairman King is president of a company yet neither one can learn to keep minutes or find someone who can? Take a look at the minutes posted online. It is not exactly rocket science. If the members are too lame or lazy to do it then get a student intern from UH or HPU. How hard could it be? A look at the minutes will also reveal at least three members never made it to the two meetings on record. Hey, if you can't show up then why are you on the council? Meanwhile why can't the Department of Health find anyone to take minutes for the council? There's not a single peron in all of DOH who can be spared for only two hours every three or four months? Maybe it is just as well, seeing as how the council members did their part to kill the SuperFerry. Thanks a lot idiots.&&&15

What he did was courageous. The two wars the US finds itself in, is because of horrific miscalulations by Bush & Co. Even if the attacks and bombing of Iraq were to take the 6 weeks that infantile Rumsfeld predicted, it would still be "illegal" and immoral. Going on 8 years...he was off that much? Idiots.

An action needs to be done soon, they are still in danger. Either you get them out and have Al Quida occupy that country again and wait for the other shoe to hit the floor. President Obama while in his owm mind thought he made our country defense stronger with many of his cut backs and attacks on our intelligence agencies and also alter they way the military extract information has totally put a hamper in getting a victory (that is such a bad word to use). People tend to forget why we are there. So prevent another 9-11. Just because the previous Administrations fault was to keep us safe at all cost, his new regime will do it by keep us safe by making nice to the enemies and delay help to our troops in harms way. It concerns me, while the American's approval rating of the President goes down, his approval rating amongst the terrorist and dictator goes up.&&&2

Community activists are also everyday folks - Hawaii Editorials&&&Thanks, Cynthia, spot on! There are also ordinary concerned citizens who have for over a month objected to Gov. Lingle's invite of Tzipi Livni, former Israeli Foreign Minister, to be a speaker at the Governors sponsored International Women's Conference on Sept. 22nd. Livni, in her role as Israeli Foreign Minister, is one of those responsible for the Gaza Massacre of Palestinians earlier this year and for Israeli Gov. murders in Lebanon.In other words we feel that a human rights violator has no place in Hawaii. We concerned citizens insist that Livni be disinvited immediately.&&&11
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&In response to Mr.Wall's plea for higher taxes as an "...obligation to our children and their future...", that obligation can and should be met by the parents of those children. The society we live in contains many parents who have and had struggled to fulfill their obligation to their children and any additional taxes will only take away their ability to continue with their personal responsibilities to their family and to themselves. If Mr. Wall wants to share his wealth with another most certainly it is his right to do so, but calling for taxing others, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet in this economy is simply unreasonable.&&&20

Kapolei closer to putting complete game together - Hawaii Sports&&&Kapolei has a lot of hype from the preseason.

Instead of saying what you're going to do, just do it and the accolades will follow. 1 player does not make the team, it's a team game.&&&1

I am sorry Randy but the 200 million already WAS in the economy until it was taken as taxes. It is not new money, it is redistributed money. As to the great news of the rail coming in under budget, that is a bold statement since work building it has not even started. Are you a betting man?

New electronic cigarettes will catch fire here - Features&&&You're right. Our self righteous prohibitionists will go nuts with rage over this one. There's no ignition. So, there's no real smoke. Hence, no smoking going on. This means that there's no second hand smoke. Let's see prohibitionists justify prohibiting that which does no harm to anyone other than the tobacco user. Sort of like how cannabis users who aren't harming anyone else are prohibited from exercising their freedom of choice. You bet it's not about the smoke. It's all about other people taking it upon themselves to tell others what is right or wrong, for them.&&&40

Editor's Picks - Hawaii Features&&&@ 16yrs old, John Rowles brought me to arousal without ever touching me. John Rowles smouldered off the cover of ‘Now & Then’ like a Daytime Soap Opera star.‘Bedtime’ came on and I felt hot, woozy and short of breath. I couldn’t focus to see. Had to leave the room before my parents noticed. Could barely walk a straight line. Needed to lean against the hallway wall to guide me to my room. Only played John Rowles when home alone after that, regularly. I still remember thinking,“Boys have Playboy and I have a John Rowles record. Girls are so different from boys!” No other man has ever had that effect on me. Elvis and Tom Jones never have. Saw John’s last Sydney Show and he still works a treat! Will fly into Hawaii for 3 nights just to see his Show at the Hawaii Theatre, Nov 8th 2009. Cannot wait!&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr. Burns, Prove Glenn Beck wrong, where is your proof. Seems like you are a little afraid of him. Obviously you did not read the HC Bill completely, or you would have found what 200 million Americans are concerned about. We all agree changes need to be made, but when the gov't is taking over companies, trying to pass a HC bill without the public being able to read it, something tells us they are being very deceptive. It makes no difference who is in office, we have questions and we deserve answers. If you have no questions, but prefer to follow blindly, they you will be sorely disappointed in your gov't. The lies and broken promises that have come out of the WH are of great concern to Americans from both sides of the aisle. This WH is bringing in 30 + czars that have completely different beliefs from what this country was founded on. They are radicals and they need to be watched. If you are happy listening to a biased MSM and reading worthless papers that is your right. We prefer to listen to those that do their homework and so far, he and others have been right on the mark. I take my information from several sources as should you.&&&37

Also, it looks like there's a lot of dealing among those poor people. Why aren't the cops doing something about it?&&&7

United States is Doomed if Obama is elected&&&This far left liberal Senator who is wet behind his ears on world affairs and social issues. If elected, he will contact the Castro government for peace talks. I could see thousands of American cubans asking for Obama impeachment. He also would talk with Iran. Obama does not realize Iran supports terrosism around the world and is supplying the enemy in Iraq who are killing our boys. He is for same-sex marriage. He says read the Sermon on the Mount. But the sermon on the mount, Jesus Christ "does not" address same-sex marriage. He doesn't believe Romans chapter one, the chapter where God calls homosexuality a sin. This left wing liberal also supports killing unborn and against Parental notification before the child seek an abortion. This guy is evil....Change???? He meant, good is evil, and evil is good. Obama is purely arogant liberal Demo.&&&32

So how did a "terrorist" get approved and invited by Gv.Lingle and Betty White? I see that Lingle spoke at Sacred Hearts Banquet..politics over human rights!? Betty White did not respond to concerned citizens inquiries and request that the Livni invite be recinded. Hawai'i has been shamed!&&&1
Perhaps Congressman Wilson is the one owed an apology&&&Sunday Sept 20, 2009 President Obama gave ABC News' George Stephanopoulos a stern talking-to Sunday for suggesting that the mandate to buy health insurance would amount to a tax. He even taunted the host for citing the dictionary definition of "tax" to make his point. "The fact that you looked up Merriam's Dictionary, the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you're stretching a little bit right now," Obama said. However, the language of the health care reform plan proposed by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., explicitly labels the penalty attached to the mandate as an "excise tax." Penalties for failing to obtain coverage would range from $750 to $3,800 under the plan. This is addressed in a section labeled: "Excise Tax." The internal revenue service would be tasked with collecting these penalties. So, is Obama really that misinformed, or was he lying this weekend as he went from talk show to talk show to pitch his version of reality?&&&3
YMCA offering all-day programs during furloughs - Hawaii News&&&We registered our Daughter who was 7 at the time in one of thier spring break programs. It cost $50.00 registration/membership. Then another $180.00, the cost for the program. We pulled her out after three days. Recieved a refund of only $100.00 The reason, my daughter stated that all they did was stay in the cafeteria and color and draw. There was huge park outside, and she never once went out on the play ground area. We went to speak to the person in charge. The 'teens' or leaders were on their phone texting or huddle together, "talking story' with each other. And all they said was "oh she not hea yet' They come by and check on us. That was enough for us. We pull'd our daughter out that second. Dont let that "YMCA" name fool u. Been there! Find 'reliable' places.&&&1

And if she was sexually molested he would say they had consensual sex prior to this incident. This seems like a made for TV movie.&&&89

Landfill to stay open until 2012 - Hawaii News&&&And the list of people who expected any differently is to be found ... where? The dilemma Oahu faces is that there will never be a solution as long as the tsunami of "disposables" continues to flood this small island. A commercial aired tonight touting a room air freshener that has a motion sensor incorporated into the design. The sensor triggered the device to spritz some odorant into the room and then cycled off for thirty minutes until the next activity caused it to go off again. This piece of consumer delight, to judge from the ecstatic smiles of the people in the commercial, would make one's life happier by far. And what a boon for the maker that the thing would automatically exhaust itself regardless of whether or not a spray was needed. Now, if you add the empty device to the shoddy, particleboard furniture, the cheap plastic toys, the layers of packaging, the wasted food ... and on and on, you end up with an endless and increasingly hard to "throw away" river of waste for which manufacturers assume no responsibility. The costs of the "disposal" are externalized onto taxpayers while the corporations pocket the profits. So Oahu can be seen as a a kind of model for the country (and the world) in that the interests of the corporate marketeers are in conflict with what is best for the community and the environment. Add a citizenry that has been turned into a zombiefied shopping mob that has no connection to the deep ecological cycles of its environment, and you get what you've got: hundreds of thousands of tons of trash that nobody wants anything to do with and so gets dumped in the backyard of the least powerful neighborhood, region, country. The dump is located where it is because that is where the rich and powerful want it ... as far away from Nuuanu, Manoa, Hawaii Kai, Kailua, Kaneohe, North Shore as possible. It will never be moved from where it is other than a few miles down the road and will of necessity be relocated in another weak, disorganized, poor, and politically unsophisticated area. This is precisely why car batteries end up being torn apart in India and Africa, ships are grounded for dismantling in India, coal waste is flooding Appalachia, Uranium mining ore waste blows in the wind of Indian lands in the Southwest. As long as the tsunami floods in, the disposal stream must flow downhill. Nothing short of a radical and revolutionary change in consciousness will make a difference, regardless of all the "green" advertising shills that companies hire. Too bad for the nearest neighbors of the dump that they are too poor, too distracted, too disheartened, too co-opted, too politically naive, and maybe too afraid to confront the monstrous, uncaring, short sighted, corrupt rich and powerful professional politicians who literally dump their waste all over them.&&&27

Scrutinize isles' tax laws - Hawaii Editorials&&&The excise tax on all items is a sham. It's not a sales tax. Other states impose sales taxes based on consumption only. Taxing food is regressive and if you really look at what the total tax is, you will see it's more like 12%, not 4.71%. So don't be fooled. Excise taxes are food gas, tobacco, and alcohol. Taxing food is criminal and how about giving the average Joe a frickin break!&&&10
Airport space allocation decided by DOT leases - Hawaii News&&&At least Markus Owens admits what the government denies, that it's where you live and who you are that determines your quality and amount of sevices. Next time I see a refridgerator dumped on the road on the westside, or trash piled up for a long time in front of a home, I'll know we're just not "breadbasket" enough to warrant good service, we just get to pay for more important people to get it.&&&11

Winter is coming soon and things are bad on the mainland so how many more will come? Why does Hawaii have to take care of so many distressed outsiders? And that River Street place will not solve anything but it sure will add to the misery the Chinatown residents and businesses now suffer. It will draw more distressed people to the area for the freebies it plans to give to all comers.&&&5

Warriors' D-line gets a boost - Hawaii Sports&&&I consider winning the La Tech game crucial for this team and our season. We've been hit with injuries before, but losing Letuli would be a huge loss because the O-line is just starting to come together and transition to becoming great. Hopefully, with Fonoti and Falemalu coming back (Healthy, I hope) we'll get the pass rush that our teams have been known for in the past. Tons of confidence in our LB's, but feel we're still weak in the DB positions. Tackling seems to still be a problem on occasion. Other the O-line, the offense has come into their own. GA has been playing the way we all expected him to, and the receiver corps is, once again, excellent. On O we seem to be pretty strong in all positions. Hope we don't lose anyone else to injuries. Go Warriors!&&&1
Contract uncertainty prompts call for more cuts at UH-Manoa - H...&&&Dasenbrock wanting "...as many ideas as possible" sounds more like, "Bring us YOUR ideas because we don't have any." It also betrays the fact that the upper echelons of UH are burdened with people who are out of their depth, and that the university has struggled with this simple fact for years. Couldn't this new VCAA, President, and the relatively new Chancellor have come up with their own solution already, especially as they're the expensive result(s) of expensive executive searches? And what about input from the distinguished community and business leaders on the Board of Regents? Where do they stand in supporting the university? Every suggestion that comes from the bottom (faculty) is ignored, or eventually neutered by career administrators, deans, and anyone else that proves the 'Peter Principle' is alive, well, and thriving at the top! These folks have all been promoted beyond their highest level of competence; we should only expect poor performance because they've all reached ceilings in their careers, in the same institution, at the same time. The 'mere' faculty members probably had the best idea, that Hinshaw's job and additional administration jobs be eliminated! It won't solve the entire budget problem, but it'll help. And it'll boost morale and save a lot of professional time, both of which are being consumed by inane bureaucratic exercises. That's time that can be re-directed to teaching and research... and of course the bureaucracy that just never stops anyway.&&&25

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Mr. Yasuhara, You didn't really believe what you just wrote did you? Racism, from which side are you speaking? Not once has there been anyone from the right say, damn the torpedos and this president. Which by the way is 50% white. Why to you call him a black President? He is an American President. Did you see the number of white people that voted for this man? I guess not. And to take Ms. Dowd's word as gospel is very dangerous. She is one of the most far left radicals out there. She is losing creditability daily. And as for racism, did you see the tape on CNN blaming the white person carrying guns into the TownHall meeting?They actually called that person a white person. Well, if you had stayed tuned, you would have seen them pan up and it was a black man carrying those guns. I think the only racism, which by the way, is very outdated, is in your mind. This country is so diverse to even mention it is sick. This country and the world, is basically chop suey. I know many Republicans that actually gave the President a chance and truly wanted him to succeed, but he has been a disappointment since day one. Way too many broken promises and his focus is on the wrong things.&&&44
Task force to put forth Natatorium suggestions - Hawaii News&&&The unabashed gall of mufi to, first, eliminate the 6.1 million that was set aside by the previous administration to restore this historic, national monument, and second, to set up a rubber-stamp advisory committee rigged and stacked to outvote others, in order to ratify mufi's disrespectful decision to erase the history of the sacrifices of our veterans of WWI, many of whom were native Hawaiians. Friends of the Natatorium should take heart that mufi will be gone soon, as his lap dog, cadwell, is gonna run for mayor as mufi jumps ship on the road to higher office and egotism. Our Natatorium is going to stay. Mufi is the one that is going to go.&&&23
Teachers deserve public's full support - Hawaii Editorials&&&If Chris Martin was concerned about separation of church and state issues, then it may have been better if he had not identified himself as a pastor. 99% of the readers probably don't know him or never heard of him so it would be a non-issue. That being said, I like his idea of local businesses being supportive of the teachers in whatever way they can.&&&13

The weakly worded and delayed policy alteration is not enough as the quoted previous assault victim and others deserve justice. One can only wonder what positions the offending rapists and assaulters hold within the Hawaiian community. KSBE should use this opportunity to invite investigators to set up a special hotline for victims to report crimes against them at the schools.&&&195

OHA's restructuring results in 12 layoffs - Hawaii News&&&What a monumental waste of both tax payer general revenue money, AND the section 5(f) ceded land revenue that is supposed to be for the "betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians, as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920." I got a better idea! Why not eliminate OHA altogether? For the beneficiaries, there would be no discernable nor noticeable difference anyway, as OHA has specialized in the art of "do nothing-ism." OHA cheats the regular tax payers footing the bill of "1000 ways to invent a fake Indian tribe" with their kau inoa garbage, and millions spent and hidden on the akaka bill rubbish too. OHA also cheats the native Hawaiians of the Hawaiian Homes Act, because the ceded land 5(f) revenue could and should be used to help put them on to the Hawaiian Home lands, as Congress intended when both the United States and the new State agreed upon Admission into the Union in 1959. We who have watched OHA these many years, have grown tired of these various publicity stunts where OHA constantly puts forth stuff like this as if to say they are coming out brand new and exciting, like a new car. Instead, we get the same old lemon car, and they are merely putting duct tape over the rust spots. If only the "cash for clunkers" program applied to OHA, we could get rid of the whole lot of useless freeloaders hanging around OHA, feeding at the trough. From one to six researchers? Research this.&&&20

Arts foundation layoffs imperil federal funding - Hawaii News&&&Another agency that thinks they are "holy cows" and shouldn't be touched. Life will go on with the layoffs in this agency and with no money coming in, there is no need to have people there to disburse it. Remember, NEA only gives matching funds so if the state isn't sending funding, then NEA won't be either. And if they can't disburse the small amount of money we are talking about with the existing staff, then maybe it's time to replace the entire staff. Some of the concerns are coming from organziations not within government but those who might receive something from the government. Sounds more like the case of the people with pink slips calling their friends for help in public forums such as this newspaper. I won't be surprised if we don't see some letters in the "letters to the editor" section on the same subject.&&&66

Parents and teachers unhappy with proposed furloughs - Hawaii News&&&The one thing all these parents have in common is that they are looking at the school as a day care service for their children. Only one expressed concern about missed classroom time. Teacher Terada should ask why the school year had previously been shortened from June 6 to May 26. Could it have something to do with her contract. I don't know but just asking. But in any event, it wasn't an issue until the furloughs were announced. Tina Rawlinds says "they keep cutting education". Not true, education has not faced any cuts until this year and in fact has grown to the point where it consumes nearly 50% of our annual budget. HSTA is lucky, there were first to strike a deal. The other public unions may not get as good a deal.&&&51

When do the ATDC board members quit denying the obvious and move on? Please, do us all a favor and quit defending your actions...two independent reviewers have spoken.

Public schools, with the huge majority of the students, get overwhelmed by the performance of the private schools. Given the upcoming furlough days, this bad situation will only worsen. I have always said that, if you have a child of this caliber, you need to get him into private school at all costs. No sense being the only super smart one at a public school class.

Either way, when our economy is tanking, and we owe the commie chinese 1 Trillion and counting, we cannot afford to reward cheapskates with 4500 cash for a 500 dollar.

Saintly voices - Hawaii News&&&All should see the house that Father Damien's parents had built, and to which he was born. At the time, it was the last house at the very edge of the small hamlet of Ninde, in the very outskirts of the village of Tremeloo, in Belgium. Made from brick the family made themselves, and back in the day, thatched roof too (almost just like da Hawaiians, if you think about it, really--except for brick or maybe not, if you think about the stone enclosures we had at some sites). Down the road from the sacred ground, are the fields, open and wide. Quiet. There you will see the dela that he would jump into the boats that took him down and into Leuven about 10 or so miles away. To study and what not. There you will see the loch he learned to swim in as a boy and the birds he saw. All of which he wrote about from Kalawao. In the house where he was born, you will see the original furniture and the interesting pattern of the sand that, back in that time, skilled artists who would pour measured amounts of sand to add an artistic design onto the floor in addition to the fact that the Belgians used the sand to clean too.

Public housing says no to big dogs - New York Times&&&As an owner of a big dog (over 70 pounds) I feel very sorry for the people that were forced to give them up. Just because some of those breeds have been destructive, it is wrong to say that they are all born with bad tendencies. I blame the press for sensationalizing dog attacks just to add a wow factor to its reports.&&&2
Aiea aces out Mililani to remain unbeaten - Hawaii Sports&&&I just wanted to let the people of Hawaii know about the Mililani High School principal. After the game at Mililani as I was approaching the 'Aiea team this tall white man "yelled" "Ho, get off the court!" I turned to him and said you can talk to me in a better manner then that sir! And he went on to tell me, "I can say what ever I want, Shut up!" Imagine my surprise when I turned around and asked who and what he was to the school. I found out from him that he indeed is the principal and his name is Dr. Brummel (don't know if that's the correct spelling). I was flabergasted that this man who has a PHD would dare to talk to a parent like that with NO provocation around others. I am still in shock at this behavior, and am reporting this to the central district superintendent. My niece and nephew who were behind me could not believe their ears and expected me to get into an argument with this man but I decided that I would not take away the joy and excitement that the 'Aiea fans were feeling. So I am going to report his behavior which I am still in shock over to the central district superintendnt this morning. I would hope that they do something about this type of behavior from such a person of high standard. This is NO way to represent any school or the Department of Education for that matter. I hope that Dr. Brummel will be reprimanded for such actions.&&&3

It is a tragity that Obama and the Congress did not immediately bring the troops home.I feel betrayed and certainly the troops and their families have been betrayed.

Friendly seal causes concern at Molokai - Hawaii News&&&"who was rescued when just a day old and raised by humans" News flash! Most feral animals at that age will imprint on whatever species takes the mother's role. "KP2, the first monk seal pup raised by NOAA, received 7 1/2 months of care in captivity, then was freed into the wild, able to forage for himself and exhibiting normal wild seal behavior, Schofield said." Again, most wild animals are not prepared for release after only knowing captivity. And this was apparently a first for NOAA. The "normal" and "wild seal behavior" was probably instinct but not enough to offset its human interactions from the start of its life. ""The seal poses a public safety risk to members of the Molokai community," said David Schofield, a marine mammal specialist with NOAA. "Some form of intervention will need to take place. It's just the when and where we're still discussing." I am all for protecting the Hawaiian Monk Seal. I support the bans on those people trying to be "one with nature" by indulging their desire to emulate some host of a Discovery Channel program. But in this case I believe it is the "protectors" who need to adapt to this unique situation. The seal should not be moved because it is dangerous to humans. I understand it is still a wild animal and should not be treated as a pet. But NOAA created its overall lack of fear and even overly friendly nature. The seal should be relocated because one day someone will take advantage of this animal's good nature and either kill or maim it for self-gratification. Oh, and who is the babooze that when suggest Kaua'i? What, two not enough? Mo bettah who evah came up wit dat one should put on a seal suit and swim with dis seal as one decoy.&&&48

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Teacher Nautu observation of Doe/Boe workers abusing valuable paid time by talking story for hours is evidence that more fat can be cut. I willing to bet that if Pat looked deeper she could find other places/departments to trim instead of teacher furloughs. As it is there are too many days off and holidays already affecting our children. I suspect that using teachers as scape goats Pat Hamamoto is really dodging the bullet as to where all that money goes. There should be enough in the school budget to take care of priorities first. Thats our children future. Where is all of this money? How come very little reaches our kids classroom? The fat is alot deeper than we are led to believe. This teacher is witness to pork still visible by her simple observation.Auwe&&&13

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Re: "U.S. mandates undermine state," Paul Smith, Honolulu. This is a good point, Paul, and why some govenors resisted taking the federal government's stimulus money, because the stimulus money funded certain programs for only the next 2 years or so, and after that, the states will have to carry those programs on their tab. So, remember that, people, when the federal government's money runs out on these programs and the states will be faced to either cut the programs, fund them on their own (tax increases), or go back to the trough of federal money (also tax money). Keep spending your childrens' futures.&&&19

Anything the democratic cronies can do to throw mud, they going do, so they are proud of your rubbish, I suppose. To me, it's pointless. Main thing, our Governor is trying to bring the deficit under control and doing what it takes, and keeping us apprised in a timely manner as to these adjustments.

Why are we in Afghanistan? - Hawaii Editorials&&&What? Fewer than 300 al-Quaida fighters, mostly in Pakistan, opposing almost 50,000 (to be raised to almost 70,000) of the best trained, best equipped, highest paid troops in the world, and yet the conflict in Afghanistan will continue. If there are barely 300 al-Quaida left, and they are not even in Afghanistan, who then is killing up to 50 US soldiers a month? Of course, it was the US that beefed up the Taliban to use as a proxy against the former USSR during that nation's misadventure there. Why the US imagines that its military will fare any better than Alexander the Great's, Great Britian's (at the height of its power) or the Russian's is a mystery. Those nations paid heavily for their presence in a land of tribes which has successfully resisted EVERY attempt to dominate it. One thing not spoken about is the pipeline proposed to be built trans-Afghanistan to bring Russian oil overland. The Taliban were invited to the US and feted many years ago to get their cooperation for this but took the bribes and went home without agreeing. This pipeline plan is probably behind our widening involvement in a place where our designated enemy no longer is.&&&46

The effects of a recession - Hawaii Business&&&Not all is bad during times like these. It's a very good time to make future plans and even for the older population too. You're not dead until your dead. It's a very good time to think. If you feel all alone because you lost your job and maybe are losing your house, no money, no health insurance and so on. Look around and you will see most people are in the same situation. Don't feel ashamed because it's sure not your fault. Think about it there are fewer cars, less pollution, less illegal immigrants coming in and the list goes on and on. Here are a few good jobs in these bad times: Sales, Certified Public Accountant, Environmental Specialists, Local Truck Driving Jobs, Healthcare Professionals, Physical/Occupational Therapists, Energy and alternative energy, Security, Undertaker Assistant, Bail Enforcement Agent, Foreclosure Cleaner, Work for yourself. There are some people that are making it ok, but they won't talk. Trust me. Life is not good or bad unless you believe it so.&&&2

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"What people want to end is the legal bounty hunt, not the right to sue and redress legitimate injury." This is absolutely correct and well stated. We have become a litigious society. We look for opportunities to sue, rather than admit that accidents happen. This kind of attitude chases away good people who want to help others. You are seeing the result in the lack of doctors now, no it isn't the lack of money, doctors anywhere make a good living. It is the fear of being sued that makes them leave the profession. If a doctor is treating someone and makes a legitimate error, that is an accident. If, through lack of training or criminal malfeasance, he injures you, then that is something worth suing for. It used to be that accidents happened. Now we are all hoping for the accident so that we can become rich by someone's error. There is no compassion or charitable attitude, let's sue 'em all! And then we wonder why good folks want out of the profession or why sleazeball attorneys proliferate. Yes, sue for auntie's care after an accident, but don't punish the individual for an ACCIDENT. Look up the term, it means an unforeseen error.&&&10

Thunderbirds roar and roll - Hawaii News&&&"'When you see some of these planes fly, you know we're the most powerful nation in the world,' said Mark Nakagawa, who came with his wife and two children." Okay ... at what price? US is 39th in health care with up to 45 million without insurance and is the only major industrialized nation without universal medical coverage. We rank way behind many other nations in education, with Japan, India, Canada, Northern European countries and others far surpassing us in math and science education hands down. We lag other nations in elder care, affordable housing, and are experiencing drastic problems with water, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The US spends more on defense than most of the other nations COMBINED, so we seem to be able to afford such spectacles as this. Yet, again, at what price?&&&45
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"why would anyone oppose people's right to choose?" Gee I don't know Dave. Perhaps it is because the "choice" I have is pay for my own insurance AND pay for someone else in the public option...nice choice. As far as keeping your own doctor..yeah right. You assume he/she will be willing to accept vastly lower payments. If not then you go doctor shopping and the choice will be those who will take those payments and they probably will NOT be the best out there. "Most people already have private health care coverage, often with employer help." Ummm let me see, the company pays 10 grand currently then the government offers coverage for 5...wonder which plan you will on NEXT year.... The ONLY people for this plan are those who want and expect something for nothing...or who do not fully understand what will happen if it is adopted. BTW, paying for any part of the new plan with funds currently being wasted or taken by fraud from Medicare is plain insane..that is OUR money being tossed away, it is NOT right to save it then re spend it.....the new plan will just have it's OWN waste and fraud like most government programs.&&&72

Warriors needed to turn yards into points scored - Further Review&&&Given the tempo of the game, if UH allowed UNLV to score early on the last drive, most likely they (UH) would have won the game or gone into OT. UNLV scores, puts up 2 pts on the conversion, the score is 33-36. With three minutes remaining, UH drives and scores (win) or gets into field goal range (OT). The challenge would be to manage the clock and keep UNLV off the field. This kind of strategy is used in tennis but seems unconventional or unacceptable in football because of the macho nature of the sport. What do you think?&&&5

Kawamoto didn't have permit to tear down estate in Kahala - Haw...&&&This is crazy, the city requires you to have a building permit, plumbing permit, electrical permit,and now a demolition permit too? I can understand the first three permits, but why do you need a permit to demolish a house? Shouldn't the contractor that did the demolition get the permit? Why doesn't the Advertiser do an article on all the permits that the Feds, State, and City require to do anything on your property, and how this is ripping off the landowner. What else is there, a grading permit, a tree trimming permit, a tree removal permit? The next thing you know you will need a permit telling you what kind of grass you can grow. This country was formed on independence, now, it has turned from that to a state of conformity. Why are the neighbors peeking over the fence and looking into things that should be none of their business. Also, the County should be responsible for maintaining the easement fronting the county streets, not the landowner. it is the City's property not the landowner's, and the responsibility for that area should be the City's. Property owners should write to the City that they are not responsible for maintaining the City's easment and will be billing the city for maintenance, or require the City to concrete the easement. Covering the easement with concrete would have a benefit to the community as it would provide more room for bike riders and pedestrians to co-exist.&&&54

If I was a Hawaii Tax payer needign the dialysis treatment I'd sit in on Lingle's office and demand free treatment.

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Why are the editors of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and Advertiser still writing editorials blaming all the problems, hopelessness and despair on the "Republicans?" Don't they realize there are virtually no Republicans in public office in Hawaii anymore -- thanks largely to their own successful propaganda efforts to purge Hawaii of all the dissenting and "politically incorrect" voices? This IS what a "Democratic" society and government looks like: "No blame me; why should I be doing something? Nobody else is doing anything."&&&12

No where do they talk about Tort reform. If I were a doctor, I wouldnt see patients that were already seriously ill because I might get sued for lack of care. It is a no win situation for the patient and doctor. Remember medicare is a government run program and the President wants to start another government run program. Get ready for more taxes.&&&28

Jobless rates worsen - Hawaii Business&&&As the economy goes up the jobs go down. Also it is predicted that some time around the middle of next year once all the stimuli money is use up the economy will take what is called a double dip. In my personal opining most of these jobs you see on the internet are scams. One guy lost $15,000.00 to get a job and it turned out to be a scam. Many companies posting job openings only want get information from you like competitor information for their own use. Many employment agency's don't have any jobs either and their using the bait and switch technique. Be aware and keep your eyes open. It can be a mean world out there for the desperate.&&&20

DOT considers move to Kapolei - Hawaii News&&&The DOT Director is asking the state legislature to support DOT's 2010 $4 BILLION dollar Highways Modernization Plan, currently canned by the legislature because it would increase associated taxes to fund the this plan. The plan would require taxpayers to ante up substantial increases in taxes that would make vehicle ownership and operation nearly triple. But if you're a construction worker, consultant, parts supplier it'll be very good money for you and the State can claim it "it creates jobs". Does this sound as if we won't have a state deficit in 2010? Must be if, according the the DOT Director, that moving employees from a single building in downtown Honolulu to Kapolei will amount to huge savings and less impact to traffic on the highway? But wait? Another State agency will move into the vacant building? Can't see the savings or impact by merely moving bodies around? DOT's reasoning just doesn't sound logical, rational or even legitimate. Sounds fishy, if you ask the person on the street.&&&36

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama, seeking to make a case for health-insurance regulation, told a poignant story to a joint session of Congress last week. An Illinois man getting chemotherapy was dropped from his insurance plan when his insurer discovered an unreported gallstone the patient hadn't known about. "They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it," the president said in the nationally televised address. In fact, the man, Otto S. Raddatz, didn't die because the insurance company rescinded his coverage once he became ill, an act known as recission. The efforts of his sister and the office of Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan got Raddatz's policy reinstated within three weeks of his April 2005 rescission and secured a life-extending stem-cell transplant for him. Raddatz died this year, nearly four years after the insurance showdown. The patient's sister, Peggy M. Raddatz, testified before the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee June 16 that her brother ultimately received treatment that "extended his life approximately three years." Nowhere in the hearing did she say her brother died because of the delay. --------- I'm not a member of the House of Representatives so I can say this: He lied (again)!&&&57

American Airlines gets $2.9B, changes routes - Hawaii Business&&&American Airlines financial problems have been averted for at least six months. Losing money is part of the airlines business, and Delta's merger with Northwest is the beginning of the future. We will see other Airlines follow suit. Southwest is probably the only major carrier still viable because of its futuristic CEO. The competitive price of a seat on Southwest is hard to beat and keeps these other airlines in check. I hope that this company expands to Hawaii and becomes like ATA was. After ATA's closing we lost a carrier that brought many people to Hawaii on a budget. Competition is after all what makes other airlines fall into place with reasonable priced seats.&&&1

Tax exemption for energy projects wins Council OK - Hawaii News&&&With the vast amount of land needed for such projects, land which is already scarce on Oahu, the CC is remiss in not taxing these projects, especially since renewable devlopers try to maximize the amount they get paid for their 'free' product that gets paid for by - you guessed it - you and me as electic customers. There is no benevolence on the part of these developers to be good neighbors, but only seek to maximize their profits at our expense. If they are going to use our land for their projects, then they should pay just like every other 'for profit' business entity. Charlie - just another bad idea from your feeble mind.&&&12

She got list of many products from Asia and research many good places that carry it.&&&11
Final day's dim light at Molokai Ranch&&&And a lesson to take away from this is: Some of the international corporations that have invested in Hawaii won't take a lot of <> from us residents. Resisting and/or preventing their "development" schemes may be what we want to do, and it may be the right thing to do, but some of them will play hardball and there are times when it will cost "us" as it has here. Oahu is a mess. What it the alternative?&&&41

UH wary of UNLV option - Hawaii Sports&&&As good as UNLV might be this year, Hawaii is better. If Hawaii comes with their 'A' game, then Hawaii wins with the 'D' shutting down the Rebels.

A friend was all set to bring me a new pet while I was still missing the pet that died. At that time I could not have cared for a new animal. That would have been unfair to the new pet and me.

Those in office too long forget that they were elected to represent their constituents, not to lecture them on what they should believe or support.

There is no better place to start the anti-incumbent movement than in our own State legislature. If a viable candidate is running against an incumbent in either the primary or general election, vote for that person regardless of party. Worried about lack of experience?

That is EXACTLY where the rail is going to go!! Whatever they do now is just going to get torn up all over again when rail gets built in five years. What a waste of time and money. How stupid do you have to be to work in government? Answer: plenty! And what is Tammy Mori talking about when she claims to be maintaining a sense of culture and space? Maybe they should have thought about that before allowing Best Buy to slap the most ugly building on Oahu right up against the road. The only sense of culture that brings is an example of a Mainland-style big box monstrosity. As anyone who lives or works in Pearl City knows, Kamehameha Highway has been one long continuous construction zone for the last 20 years at least. Want to improve traffic? Here's a tip: STOP it with the endless construction!! Don't keep digging it up every six months. Oh, but then the contractors won't have the big bucks to funnel back into campaign contributions. So, yeah, that won't work. OK, go back to ripping up the road, again....&&&4

BOE panel rejects rise in bus fares - Hawaii News&&&The BOE has seriously created and promoted the ill-conceived policy of busing children to distant schools. Building schools close to residential communities would allow and encourage children to walk or bicycle to school, benefiting from the exercise and enjoying the beauty and scerenity of the experience. The present busing policy forces the young students to wait at bus stops, then sit for long periods on crowded, polluted buses for hours every school day. Bus drivers frequently report serious misbehaviour and vandalism. It is time to stop the forced transport of young students for long distances in a very unhealthy environment. To protect the children from contagious diseases and viruses. Stop the subsidization of school bus transport. Build local schools. Aloha oe&&&28

Drought has eyes turning to Mexico - Hawaii News&&&Long ago Mark Twain said that in the American West whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over. I love to get into the Colorado River upstream at Bullhead City, because summers are usually over 110 degrees. But it is pretty modest as the size of rivers are gauged. The use of the river for thirsty crops grown in the Imperial Valley may have to give way to use for wetlands and for the growing population.&&&3
Curbside crackdown - Hawaii News&&&"It's like they've got nothing better to do," he says. "They've got prostitutes. They've got drug dealers. We're entertainers!" As much as we all empathize and sympathize with the performers, one persons prostitute is another's entertainer. Unfortunately, the entertainers are a nuisance, since they tend to crowd the sidewalks and impede others. Sometimes, the crowds and entertainers make it like a "shoving match" to get across. If there was a designated area - and the area would have to be AWAY from the sidewalks and main thoroughfares then I think a lot of residents would welcome it. The goal is to keep the sidewalks clear and free. However, that's where these performers "get the crowds." The performers would cry hell if they were moved to out of the way areas, or just come back to the sidewalks and risk fines and arrest. We all know its a cat and mouse game between the performers and the police. So, unless some ordinance can be drawn up to resolve this issue once and for all (while not running foul of the previous court ruling) this cat and mouse game will continue.&&&138

Aloha Tower needs better development - Hawaii Editorials&&&Aloha tower was once a bustling place for tourists and locals alike, then this bunch of know it all developers decided they'd build some kind of high rent, exclusive condo city around the pier and forced out long time residents like Kapono's. Without K's the locals quit coming and then the tourists quit coming and the shop workers were all sitting around, smoking cigs at the tables with a half dozen tourists wandering aimlessly around the pier. Maybe if you begged and gave him free rent for 1-3 years, you could get Mr. Kapono back with his music and the local bands playing every weekend, and the residents could come back out to dance and have some drinks, but you're all too smart for that.&&&18

Controversial photo shows grisly side of war - Hawaii News&&&Odd that sanitization of these wars can be so carefully maintained despite the thousands upon thousands of casualties. Or not so odd ... when one considers that, were the truth be known (or shown), the masses might be distracted long enough from their shopping and sports events to confront what is happening. The professional military members can expect to suffer injuries and death; after all, the business of war is to kill people and break things and the tools of the trade are dangerous weapons. I wonder when though we will see an article posing the same sensitive questions about the fate of the civilians killed and injured. Odd that the sanitization of the war continues in regard to them ... we are not even provided an estimate of their numbers by our government, leaving us blissfully ignorant of them and, alternately, hyperaware of our own losses, which have been minimal in comparison.&&&68

Your experience is sure paying off and I think with Aneli, you two are rubbing off on the rest of the team which I think is just great. Saturday y'all look like you were having a lot of fun while executing your skills to your fullest potential. Only one achilles heel, the tip shots. Someone must be makaala (alert) to pick those up and a little work on the serving will also help in the rest of the season.

The last time I was in Hawaii, I visited two Hilo Hattie locations...one on Oahu and one on Maui. I have to say, I was rather disappointed in both places. Mainly since all the Hilo Hattie Hawaiian shirts were no longer manufactured on the islands. I'm sorry, but I will not buy an Aloha shirt that is *NOT* made in Hawaii unless there is a compelling reason to do so...and unfortunately, I found no compelling reasons in Hilo Hattie. Ed&&&3

Vacation rentals not the culprit in Laie woes - Guest Editorials&&&"BYUH President Dr. Steven Wheelwright is right about much-needed city/state support for the school's expansion and building affordable housing in North Laie. The area desperately needs the economic stimulus the expansion will bring....The Koolau Loa region hosts 137 vacation rentals ( ), or 3.8 percent of 3,618 homes. How could such trivial loss of homes have led to a family-splitting housing crisis in Laie?" Mr. Swart, while you make some good points, the bigger problem is second homes. Rarely is a home in Laie purchased by people who live and work out here. The number of sales of homes to people who don't live or work in Ko'olauloa continues to increase each year - last year more than half of the sales!&&&16

Tourism will result in higher prices, low paying jobs and an unstable future when times are bad. Welcome to the future. But here is one easy fix. The state has virtually destroyed agriculture, so who needs a whole department of agriculture? Why is there a Milk Board if there are no commercial dairies? The list goes on. Eliminate the entire department, especially those overpaid directors and move the remaining functions of inspection. Good luck, you folks gonna need it.&&&273

HPD weighs tattoo cover-up - Hawaii News&&&Professionalism is how an individual carries themselves and interacts with others, not whether they have tattoos. By supporting negative stereotypes this policy would effectively criminalize tattoos. The Honolulu police are going to negatively affect officer morale by creating a double standard between officers with and those without tattoos. Officers should be treated equally and judged on their performance not on their choice to have tattoos or not. If the issue is that of being "out of uniform" then change the uniform to long sleeved uniforms for ALL officers.&&&1
Maui Council bans shark tours&&&Maui Bans Shark Tourism - Million Dollar Mistake The number one rule for regional tourism is "never take tourism options off the table." This rule looks into the future of tourism destinations and changing public demand. What is not popular today may well be tomorrows latest fashion. Case in point Florida's disastrous decision to ban commercial shark diving in 2001. At the time anti-shark opponents hailed the decision as a "win." The number one rule came into play shortly after that fateful decision. As short sighted Florida politicians, quasi eco groups and media folks congratulated themselves, a smaller celebration in the Bahamas quickly turned into a $70 million dollar ongoing tourism boon for the islands. Bahamas commercial shark tourism. Today the Bahamas has the distinction of being the "Shark capitol of the planet," enjoying thousands of shark tourists who flock to these islands to interact with sharks safely, and sustainably. As a side benefit, since 2001, over 300 shark centric film and television productions have been shot here highlighting the Bahamas to millions of additional tourism seekers. This week the island of Maui banned shark tours in their waters. No great loss it seems as Maui has never explored shark tours in their region, making this decision little more than political grandstanding of the worst kind. If there's anything to be learned from the Maui decision this week, savvy regional politicians should take heed. Tourists like destination options, and when presented with bans on any tourism option they will flock to the place where they can find that option. These are basic tourism facts, stripped away from rabid anti-shark diving groups who equate sharks with fear, first and foremost. Florida is one $70 million dollar lost example of that basic tourism principal and now Oahu, with it's thriving commercial shark operations is poised to enjoy the flood of tourism seekers that Maui is turning away. Is anyone paying attention to the tourism numbers in Maui? Clearly not. On Oahu hopefully politicians can see the opportunity that one short sighted island has presented to them. Florida politicians showed us in 2001, by lack of vision and poor planning, how ignoring "the number one rule," can hurt the broader economy at large.&&&1

The Democrats claim to be out to "protect our health", according to Pelosi, Abercrombie, Hirono, Inouye & Akaka anyway. What makes ANYONE think they are going to do it "better" with Obama Care? Oh THATS right, it is the "evil" Republicans that can be blamed - but for the past 30 years??? How can any intelligent person actually BELIEVE their propaganda? Of course the GOP is so "uncaring" because they DON'T believe the government should be involved in anything, excepting Defense. Hence their perceived indifference. But they have not done much either to fix it. Both parties are disingenuous at best, criminal at worst.&&&2

Onward with Kakaako plan - Hawaii Editorials&&&The irony of these plans is that they are presented as if they represent the only alternatives. Given the overdevelopment of Ala Moana to Waikiki, with the noise, pollution, outrageous traffic and commodification of "nature" into a kind of urban, Disneyfied fraud, why not halt the development and turn these two areas into parkland? KSBE can well afford that and, if it wanted to act as a visionary leader, can easily afford to purchase the other site and block the development of additional walls of steel and glass along the oceanfront. The destruction of the viewplanes and the permanent installation of yet more shopping areas, parking lots, condos and such will further seal Hololulu's fate as a wrecked city with little natural beauty available but for the ocean views enjoyed by the few rich who will be able to afford to purchase.&&&14

Ability to make plays was key to Hawaii's rout - Further Review&&&I would agree that we shouldnt be drinking too much koolaid. Afterall we beat Cenral Arkansas and WSU....evidentially it didnt impress the AP or USA pollsters. Our punter is an enigma. He booms it in practice and yet is averaging 29 yards per punt on 7 attempts....that is a receipe for disaster against a team that can capitalize on field position. Also, our turnovers are killing us and that special formation with Inoke sucks. For the life of me I dont understand why we insert Funaki who was ineffective in 2008 and take out Alexander who had over 400 yards passing in this game....too cute....sure looks like it. UNLV played the Beavers tough and OSU kicked the winning FG with seconds left in the final quarter. On a positive note, our O has gone from comatose to consistent--at least for 2 quarters. Im not convinced our D has capacity to stop the run....even against UNLV. The point is we need to continue to improve and save the pom pom celebrations for the next two opponents on the road.&&&2

When a republican governor was elected twice "by the people," the democratic battle cry was, "Okay, we lost this one, so let us strive to make sure that she fails in each and ever endeavor. That way we can be assured that a democrat will be returned to the governors seat. After all Jim, it's not about people, it's about politics.&&&5

6% - Hawaii Features&&&Maine is extremely small business oriented. They back up small business in every way. Check some time and you will see how many successful small businesses there are up there? From my own research Maine is the leader in small business. Small business does a lot of manufacturing for the rest of the U.S. also. On the other hand Hawaii is anti-small business and we have no support over here like they do. As you know small business in Hawaii is chocked to death by State, C&C regulations and the Union control so of course Hawaii is top heavy compared to Maine. So now next question? When will Hawaii wake up? In my opinion never. Everyone is in the government or union and the only thing they want to do is increase taxes for their own selfish interests thereby killing our economy completely. Why is this so simple for me to understand and so hard for the government and unions to understand? It clears as crystal to the rest of us that has to pay their salaries.&&&44
Rain fails to put a damper on Donohue's Kick Start day - Hawaii...&&&Do not let Putzulu become chief he is a very arrogant fool. He is rude and thinks that the public is stupid. HPD will be hindered with this idiot as a chief. Because he was the deputy does not mean he should become chief. The guy is terrible when it comes to people and this man is the cause of the creation of the word and term for "self-centered and arrogant". Just say no to Puke-zulu for Chief.&&&3

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr.Mahr, Why is it Ms. Lingle is the one to have to soften her stance. She has a budget to balance before it can be presented. We are top heavy with state workers. The unions are killing us. I wonder how many union officials will be taking a pay cut, or a furlough or a layoff? Not many I bet. They need to lead by example and not use it's members as pawns. They need to be accountable to it's members. I know this isn't a popular comment, but someone has to speak the truth. This country is in such a fragile state right now and it is being brought down by the unions with unreasonable retirement funds and salaries. Just ask any American Car manufacturer. Since we made the headlines last week for being one of the worst states for pork barrel, perhaps we can find another use for some of those ridiculous funds. The corruption in this country and state as well, needs to stop now. The unions have made it clear, they aren't in the mood to help the state, they have too many self serving projects to support.&&&5

Woman gets 18 months for deadly car accident - Hawaii News&&&Woman Sentenced to 18 Months... I have known Sarah Whitford since she was a child. It broke my heart to hear what had happened. When I initially spoke with her after this tragedy her remorse was and continues to be deep. She immediatley began measures of coping and placed her heartfelt remorse and guilt in the hands of God. She went to and continues in AA and speaks to individuals and groups about driving drunk and has not stopped speaking to these groups. Sarah cannot change what has happened. She can, with the help of God find forgiveness and use her experience to help others. Friends and family of Sarah Whitford continue to pray for the victim's family may we all find healing in God's grace.&&&26
6% - Kokua Line&&&I wonder what the total in Hawaii is for workers at all levels of government. With the military, I would guess that adding in Federal workers would rate Hawaii very high among states for the percentage of all workers employed by one level of government or another.

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&People of Hawaii, you can help! The United States is under attack from within and Barack H. Obama is leading the assault. Evidence abounds that he is not eligible to be President and he refuses to provide evidence to the contrary. While he fights lawsuits to open the records which would prove or disprove his meeting the Constitutionally prescribed qualifications, he continues his assault upon America and its institutions. You can call a special session of your State Legislature and pass a bill which provides that those seeking or holding the Office of President of the United States, or are in the line of succession, whose certificates of birth are registered in the State of Hawaii, do not have the privilege of preventing the disclosure of that information to the public. This could be done in one day. If the Governor should veto the measure, the Legislature can override it. Obama has given ample cause for concern regarding his eligibility to be President of The United States and is showing continuing contempt for the United States as well as for the Constitution itself, as his administration progresses.&&&262

U.S. tourism bill good for isles - Hawaii Editorials&&&Almost 1 million foreign visitors mostly from Asia. Just think if we had gaming. These Asian love to gamble and I often wonder just how many bypass Hawaii because of this. Time to reconsider this issue with the passing of a bill that would disallow lobbyist from Nevada from contributing to the coffers of our politicians. The opposition to gambling will say that the low income would suffer. This may be so, but we the taxpayers are the ones paying to subsidize them, and we are losing many jobs. If there is no jobs then who will pay taxes? This industry has so much potential and will lift revenue to sustain our government employees, create jobs, and help education. How much of Hawaii's money is left in Las Vegas? Shoudn't this money be for Hawaii? Traveling through Nevada on my way to Denver I came upon the last town before Utahs border on Interstate 80. This town of Windover has many casinos catering to the Utah residents. Hawaii and Utah are the only states that have O gambling but this border twon is thriving on Utah gamblers. Hawaii needs to join the rest of the nation and give gaming a shot.6868&&&13

It's always increase, increase, increase -- particularly with their benefits and wages. Don't they work FOR the company? Weren't they hired and get paid BY the company. Many in the public see most pilots as arrogant -- a "we're God" or "without us the company is nothing" attitude. Most want more wages to pay for their extravagant lifestyle -- the chateau, the maserati -- in addition to alimony and child support. "My mommy said to play with Me!"&&&33
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Mrs Oceans deliema is very sad. Her former employer circumnavigated the law by making her work as a private contractor. He did this to escape paying the rquired medical coverage required by law. If you work more than 20 hours a week it is the law that you get medical. Many employers try this with stating that you are a private contractor. You should check with the citys branch of government that has the say on who fits the bill as a contractor. Many employees are afrid to speak up fearing they will lose their jobs, but you must stand up for your rights. As in Mrs Ocean case she ended up with many thousands of dollars in the hole. The employer got off with breaking the labor laws and should be reprimanded. She should check the statue of limitation and seek a labor attorney. Watch that employer scramble to make things right. Aloha&&&5
Economy dims unions' festivities - Hawaii News&&&Three furlough days per month sounds better than layoffs.&&&56
Maui August condo sales rose; homes kept falling - Hawaii Business&&&House prices will keep falling in most places because those prices are still dangerously high compared to incomes and rents. Banks say a safe mortgage is a maximum of 3 times the buyer's yearly income with 20% downpayment. Landlords say a safe price is a maximum of 15 times the tenant's yearly rent. Yet in coastal areas, both those safety rules are still being violated. Buyers are still borrowing 6 times their income and putting only 3% down, and sellers are still asking 30 times annual rent, even after recent price declines. Renting is a cash business that reflects what people can really pay based on their salary, not how much they can borrow. Salaries and rents prove that prices will keep falling for a long time. Anyone who bought a "bargain" this time last year is already sitting on a very painful loss.&&&3

Jeweler not giving up yet in dispute over plumeria designs - Ha...&&&Even when Fender Musical Instruments tried to sue various other guitar manufacturers on April 25, 2003 to claim they had the patent rights to specific guitar body shapes they created since the early 1950's, they were ruled against. "Guitar makers Fender have lost an application to make its Stratocaster, Telecaster and Precision guitar body shapes a trademark in the USA. Similar applications have previously been rejected, both in the UK and the rest of Europe. In the court case, Fender had targeted the designs of Stuart Spector Designs, US Music Corporation, ESP Guitars, Sadowsky Guitars, Lakland Musical Instruments, Peavey Electronics, Warmoth Guitar Products, Schecter Guitar Research, Michael Tobias and others as infringing its designs. But the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office said: "Fender refers to the 'iconic' status of these [instrument] outlines in American popular culture. However, we must resolve a narrow issue: Do consumers associate these two-dimensional outlines, depicted in the drawings, as indicators of source?" from: See U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Application Serial# 76515928,76516126 & 76516127.&&&12

Inspirational Albom headlines writers confab - Hawaii Features&&&I had the pleasure of reading and advanced copy of Mitch's book, HAVE A LITTLE FAITH! Wow! What a great little book. I highly recommend you read it - and buy a few for gifts, too! The main message of the book is,"what if faith wasn't what divided us, but what brought us together?"  In a world where SOOO many wars are started in the name of religion and holier-than-thou attitudes prevail amongst so many different groups, it seems like all of our problems would be solved if only we could just say, "Hey, I have faith, you have faith...however we get there doesn't matter.  What matters is that we both BELIEVE."  Doing good for others is sometimes the greatest way to experience pure joy.  If we all gave a little more of ourselves unselfishly, I do believe that peace would prevail. Great book. Can't say enough about it. Hawaii was fortunate to have him be a part of this conference!&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&After listening to O's speech the other night, I had to wonder why, not once was reining in Big Pharma, the hospitals, and the attorneys, tossed out there for the people to hear. Drugs is the one big expense that hits the elderly so heavily in later years. The cost of drugs is out of control. But it seemed to be more about involving themselves into private citizens lives instead of reining in the true culprits. If they would just get medicare and medicaid under control as well as Big Pharma, things would be better. Put a ceiling of law suits. Limit the amount an attorney can make. They need to clean up their own house before telling us what we will do. Our government, the one that is suppose to work for us, is so deeply inbedded with Big Pharma to the tune of $100 million dollars a year, that they won't listen to the people. A few weeks back, there was a program showing how the Cleveland Clinic deals with HC and how such an amazing hospital it is. I think we could learn so much from them. There are so many things that could be done. Playing the blaming game, solves nothing. In May, the Republicans wrote the left a letter asking to be heard and was ignored. They have 5 bills that they would like to be considered. Again, nothing. Both sides are wrong, but are any of them working for us? Is anyone listening to us? The figures tossed out to us, do not make sense. Do they really think we are that stupid? Taking care of abuses is going to find enough money? Get real. This is about protecting the special interest groups and not doing what is right. They are to only ones that will win.&&&66

Exclude religion from discrimination laws - Guest Editorials&&&Why include religion? Because history shows us the results of not including religion. Is it really okay to deny housing or employment to a young family simply because they worship in a different way? This has nothing to do with honest debate over philosophy and belief. In fact, it's the opposite. Religious discrimination is an attempt to strong-arm people into believing as you do when your skills of persuasion are not up to the task.&&&7

Isle hotel occupancy falls below standard - Hawaii Business&&&A huge Aloha to everyone. My wife and I have been away for a couple of weeks. In reference to fewer tourists, I have stated many times in the past...AND HOTELIERS...you have to face the facts, people are not spending the way they did. And the hotels are doing a good job of lowering rates, but many hotels spent 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 million upgrading. They probably never will get most of that money back. Hawaii, don't worry, the tourist will still come but not in the numbers as in the past. The high end hotels, Moana Surfrider, Royal Hawaiian and Hilton Hawaiian Village will do good as the wealthy will continue to come and spend. The rest of the hotels are just going to have to realize they have to cater to the bread and butter tourists, the return tourists, for occupancy. Hawaii is different, with the Aloha spirit shown by the hawaiians, you will continue to go well. Aloha from Northeast PA.&&&22

That pretty well describes the Republican Congressman from South Carolina turned "heckler" when the President of the United States addressed a joint session of the Congress yesterday. The poor guy probably thought he was still coaching the Republicans who were being trained to disrupt town hall meetings as a way to prevent ensuring health care for the 46 million uninsured in our country. My Republican friends said they too were embarrassed, just like the rest of us. It is not what we expect in the Halls of Congress. Hecklers are usually ejected by the Sergeant at Arms. Me ka pono, Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&8
Hurricane insurer has a local owner a " again - Hawaii Business&&&I wonder if the State Insurance Commissioner has reviewed the rates that ICAT is charging for hurricane insurance in Hawaii. My hurricane insurance premium doubled after my insurance company decided to quit writing hurricane insurance and shifted its clients to ICAT. That was a bad move since I then changed insurance companies and now have hurricane insurance through a different carrier at about the same rate as before.&&&3
Kona Street sewer work to be done by month's end - Hawaii News&&&There are, however, maximum and minimum speed limits. If a cyclist is unable to keep up with the minimum speed limit they are breaking the law and should not be on that roadway. HPD can be called to deal with that.&&&1

Richard Kitchens - Hawaii Editorials&&&The facilities people at the two bases need to wake up and see the writing on the wall. The first thing that goes is the facilities and maintenance personnel due to consolidation. A case of too many people for not enough work. Senior managers will be cut first, then everyone will bump down. Hickam's weekly time allowed is history, due to the increased requirements for productivity. This is all because of the Navy's long history of Tradition.&&&3

UH's Kiesel-Kauhane gets a look in the middle - Sports News&&&Jason, really nice feedback regarding the defensive changes. Interesting. But as a team, I think there are more questions on offense. Tell us what's going on there with the lack of an effective running game. It was written during the Spring and Fall camps that the guards were being coached to improve their run-blocking. That new training contraption Shaw implemented to teach the linemen to stay low coming out of their stance. But no results last game. What's up?&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Turn nose at inanity, let feet do rest at polls" Carol I knew a few of those tuna packers. They stink like nothing in this world. If you are able to get close enough to talk with them they will tell you that they really can't do much about the smell though. Many take a bath three and four times a day and the smell just won't go away. At least they are working and I respect that. If you ride the City Bus then there are certain procedures you must follow. You must put coins in your ears to keep the noise down. Which is against the law in Hawaii believe it or not? That old law is still on the books. Next you must roll up two pieces of cotton and stick them in your nose and finally you must wear a surgical mask and surgical gloves all times. Also a girl that I know said never sit with a man when his zipper is down. She says this goes on more that people realize so use caution. Other than that have fun.&&&15

BOE at odds over proposal for more library closure days - Hawai...&&&I can feel some empathy for State Librarian Richard Burns in his quest to trim the State Library budget. Unfortunately, like our legislators, City Counsel members, and now the BOE just can't seem to make a decision about anything. "No, let's table it for now! No, let's form a committee. No, we need to look at this more indepth," seems to resound from the legislative halls, council meeting room, and the BOE. We desperately need representatives that will forge ahead and make those decisions, not dilly-dally along hoping that it will all go away.&&&20
Meetings cover fishing rules and proposed changes - Hawaii News&&&State of Hawaii should instill the Fishing License Law. Every fishermen must apply for a fishing license and must be visible, worn around the neck at all time while fishing. Limit all catches to certain size and outlaw certain fish. Harsh fines should be charged for infractions. This way, it give the fish population a chance to recover.&&&27

Let's hope Iran can construct an at least somewhat functional democracy. We have given them the metaphorical ball of freedom and they must now try and run with it. Let's hope fervently for their sakes and the sake of the ongoing war against militant Islam that they are successful. And let all free people give thanks to all the servicemen of all the countries involved that are fighting to keep us free.&&&1
Rethink Natatorium plan - Hawaii Editorials&&&Excellent column laying out the view that it may cost even more to destroy this National Monument than to preserve it and the memory of those brave fighting soldiers, sailors and marines that gave their all in service to our Country. And you folks, the Save Kaimana Beach people, better kokua too. If no more our Natatorium, not going have your beach either. Take a look at, and to the right of the Natatorium, all the way over to the Aquarium. Only get exposed corral. That's how your former beach going look if you no help us out. The staph concern should be remediated somehow. This is the 21st Century: It can be solved. Sacrifices made, lives lost, in order for you to lay in the sun, clueless as to how you are able to enjoy these United States of America.&&&33

150-acre wildfire forces closure of H-2 freeway - Hawaii News&&&Chalk up another disaster to the completely unprepared city and state governments, including the hopelessly inept HPD. This article makes it sound like the traffic problems were a minor annoyance when, in fact, it was a gridlock disaster. How many times does a major freeway have to get shut down before someone in government gets a clue that they need to have contingency plans for handling this kind of thing? Why were there hardly any announcements on the radio? Where was HPD to redirect traffic? Did anyone have the faintest idea of where to reroute all the cars? Doesn't anyone working for government in Hawaii take pride in their work and try to serve the public, instead of just collecting a paycheck while putting out the minimum effort necessary? Mufi can't get the folks at HPD to do their job and for that he wants to be governor?&&&19

Rosenberg and the Captain of the Titantic have something in common; both will ride a sinking ship down to the bottom. when is Hearst going to wake up and smell the coffee that Rosenberg is nothing more than a glorified salesman and lacks GM skills.&&&1

Safety-check reminders halted because of costs - Columnists&&&Safety-checks are a joke. Why do I have to pay someone to tell me that my car is safe? Why do I have to pay extra for a car that has tint? The car didn't change... tint blocks the glare so doesn't that make it safer for me to drive it? Why do we need safety checks? So the criminals can rip them off of our cars. Yeah sure that busted up Honda with the cracked windshield isn't safe to drive but it has a safety check. Something is wrong there. They should just do away with "safety" checks&&&5
Polls in governor's race too sketchy to count on - Columnists&&&The recent poll was conducted by SMS Research, a reputable local firm. I do not think we can discount its results.&&&1
Isle schools right to limit recruiting - Hawaii Editorials&&&I too had a friend who was misled by a Navy recruiter who was less than professional. It was the classic bait and switch tactic, their lies came out at the MEPS station on Oahu. After some fast work and a letter to the Chief Petty Officer in charge of Navy recruiting, it all worked out. Question for the Navy is why they allowed this and other similar situations to go on in full knowledge of those in charge? Why? Over aggressive recruitment from top Navy brass was one part of the problem, they set goals that were impossible to achieve and knew it. When will those in charge learn it is better to be honest up front versus trying to cover your okole when you get caught? Look at the damage to the Navy's reputation this Petty Officer caused, all fully approved by his unprofessional supervisors. What were they thinking? Well, what goes around comes around.&&&21

Double-duty forces Lee to make an unusual call - Hawaii Sports&&&When you have high school coaches coaching college and calling high school plays, there will be unfortunate setbacks. Ron Lee's excuses that he needs to work more with the receivers are very lame yet, it makes one appreciate JJ even more cause not only his play calling was excellent but he could and would make adjustments during the game and yet, he is the head coach and offensive coordinator. All of this is a pretext that Ron Lee is incompetent as an offensive coordinator just as last year's offensive line and special teams coachers were just horrible. Nothing more and nothing less.&&&8

Warriors' Salas finds a home in slot - Sports News&&&the coaches at nebraska knew what they were doing when they moved wrightjackson to defense. it's clear that he doesn't know how to run with the ball. on 3 occasions he chose to run to a defender and get tackled rather than running toward open field for more way more yards. and didn't anyone tell him to keep an eye out for #9? on the 2nd play of the game for crying out loud. what he forgot after the 1st play. in past years wrightjackson was just fat and out of shape. this year he has shown he just doesn't have the skills of a running back, and he definitely is not a play maker.&&&1

Cantonese comfort cuisine - Weekly Eater&&&The white rice cake is very good. Generous size. I don't know why they chop the roast pork so small and always in the kitchen, never in the front. The roast pork is average. But preparation of dishes is not consistent. I have ordered the Pork Bitter Melon three times. The first two times it was above average. I've had excellent. I ask for no oyster sauce. Use black bean sauce instead. The third time, the bittermelon was old; some pieces were previously frozen or previously cooked. There were two pieces of chicken in the order. It's better to eat there. Strange things happen when you order take-out. You find out, when you open it. I won't be back there.&&&1
There are ways to keep your cat healthy - Hawaii Features&&&Exercise. Cats need lots of exercise. I taught my wife's Siamese to swim. First, in the bathtub to help her gain confidence. She learned quickly, and I soon thereafter introduced her to open water, like, I took her with me deep sea fishing last month. We're about ten miles out, and just for the fun of it I dropped her over the side. Well, as luck would have it, she just started paddling off toward Guam or someplace out there, and by golly, we haven't see her since. If any of you folks spot her, well, don't call us, we'll call you.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Ref Leonard Leong's ltr "Get involved in issues and in findng solutions." Perhaps in a perfect world Leonard. As a retiree and with strong interest in our Local State and C&C governments functioning, I have attended, far to numerous to count, sessions, committee meetings, and hearings of both. Until such time that we, the people can stop the strangle hold of Unions over our elected representatives, nothing will change. It's truly unfortunate that we elect these people and in turn they represent the Unions, not the electorate. You really want to know how and if your representatives truly represent you, you can check out the attendance roster online after the legislative session is over. One representative, who shall remain unnamed, missed over three-quarters of the roll calls during one legislative session. Can one believe that in a part time legislature, this representative truly represented his constitutents?&&&2

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Ref Jeffrey K. Lyons's ltr "Government must loosen its control." Jeff there's no easy answer to the economic problems Americans face today. It became, when Government loosened controls over the free-market, it quickly evolved in a greed-based system. Big business and unions took advantage of each and every American citizen. Exorbitant salaries paid to executives, and unions demanding more and more. And meanwhile who picked up the tab. As an example, in 2001 the CEO of Travelers Insurance was paid $52 MILLION dollars in salary, bonus, etc. Rates continually climbing to pay for all these extravagances. No Jeff, if anything, the government needs to rein in these "gone wild" companies and unions.&&&12

Goes to show you how truly third world they are. Hello, when is the unbiased, truly investigative news reporting? Well, not that the Nei ever had any. When Union Lapdog/Arbitrator Philip Tamoush closed the process to public news crews, no TV station gave a background report on him. More info from Google then all the Nei's TV stations put out. Then again, Union bosses own the TV stations so same ole, same ole. Ahhhh, down the slippery path to deeper third world status we go. Hang on to your wallets, the arbitrator will be slamming the state soon, picking up extra money from the unions. Just another day in the Nei.&&&2
A lawmaker's long reach - Hawaii Editorials&&&I plan to vote for Ambercrookie for governor. Of Guam. Perhaps legislation should have just mandated US citizenship and not try to set wages. Guam is a little Hawaii; government some tourism and that's it. When the government construction jobs leave, toursim which will be neglected and overpriced will not be able to carry the load. The locals there, many unskilled for these government jobs will simply make good victims while the US taxpayer pays for it. Ambercrookie as governor of Hawaii won't have the same checkbook as in Washington so his promises and payoffs will come directly out of our pocket. He has been emailing me to support him but I asked for some specifics on what he will do and how he will improve the economy. Nothing. I'm no fan of Mufi either but he stayed in town and didn't drink the DC Kool Aid.... Yet.&&&7

Health care reform vital to practically everyone - Guest Editor...&&&Well, this is just wonderful. Health care reform will fix all these shortcomings int he health care system, even though nobody has yet to get specific on exactly what health care reform is. How about some discussion of the down side of this. Who will pay for all this health care reform? How? When? How exactly will health care reform (interchangably called health insurance reform) do this? This piece reminds me of the propaganda AARP is hawking- health care reform will solve all the problems, create no new problems and will pay for itself. Sure it will.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Here is another example folks of the incomplete reasoning of another reader: "...Second, the rail project will spend at least $200 million next year. That's $200 million in new money coming into our economy. The new revenue should help the bottom line for the state government. Maybe it's even enough to help avert some of the layoffs that the governor is talking about." What is not recognized by this individual is that the $200 million was taken out of the taxpayers pockets, thus removing equivalent economic activity that would have occurred if the taxpayers had never been taxed in the first place. It is fundamental that for every dollar of economic "stimulation" the government generates the same amount of economic activity is taken out of the economy by removing those dollars from the taxpayers. Given that the government is the worst practitioner of fruitful spending I place my bets on the individual taxpayer to better stimulate the state's economy.&&&14
25 years of aloha - Hawaii News&&&Wow good to hear that Carol is still on the move. I was one of the many volunteers that worked on the bed race. I was part of the communications committee. We were the guys who lined the bed race with speakers mic and etc. It was a lot of fun doing the race with Carol and gang. When the race was over we started on the next which meant monthly meetings of the committee and then closer to the event weekly. I must say that Carol really did a good jobe bringing so many different businesses together and then leading us all in one direction. As a member of Hawaii Sound Systems I can say that we felt it a privilege to work with Carol and all those involved in the bed race and other activities. Well Carol if you ever see this you might not know who that Guy Gilbert is but I am sure your remember my nick name Rick,aloha&&&1

Politics behind Akaka Bill stance - Hawaii Editorials&&&Whether Bush or Obama appointees, the land upon which this "tribe" seeks to control are the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, and the Admission Act, Section 5(f) lands, which the US Supreme Court only recently stated are limited to five purposes, one of which is "for the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians, as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920." The editorial today, although well meaning, completely misses that it was the kingdom itself that deliberately failed to deliver to the common native Hawaiian tenants, their one-third share of their lands in the Mahele of 1848. In other words, the HHCA and 5(f) lands do not belong to all "Hawaiians," as those lands comprise the undelivered share belonging to the common native Hawaiian tenants, and not the descendants of chiefs and konohiki who have already received their one-third share of such lands. To magically invent an Indian Tribe and call it a "Native Hawaiian Self-Governing Entity," cannot survive the scrutiny such tribe or entity will endure at the US Supreme Court, for a number of reasons not mentioned in the article. To discount the Commission's position simply because of the composition of its members, would be to ignore basic precepts unique to Hawaii not found among the various Indian tribes.&&&24
Punahou pounds Damien - Hawaii Sports&&&Damien looked so disorganized in every facet of the game. Yes, they were outmanned but their lack of organization and playcalling was certainly a reflection on their inability to be on the field as a team. Having watched Iolani play Kam, they, too, were definitely overmatched and outmanned but the difference in discipline, organization, and skill sets was a reflection on the coaching compared to Damien's embarrassment as a team and for its coaching staff.&&&4

"The HGEA could agree to furloughs and save these jobs. They could be the hero of this movie." The Union should have worked out some furlough process with the governor and save these jobs...but not they tried to bluff and burned their members instead! HGEA, being a "hero"...sounds like a script coming from LaLa land! That's the kind of pea-brain mentality Hawaii's political cronies have...simply because they are just a bunch of incompetent parasites "appointed" to their high paying positions not of merit, but by "scratching" some politician's back! The State should fire imediately all these political "dead beats" and let the ones who actually do the work, get promoted to management positions.&&&49
Isle cancer research gets $2.8M boost - Hawaii News&&&I find it interesting that Dr. Salk found a vacine for polio in 18 months, yet our researchers have been working on cancer for 30 years, if not longer. Could it be that they don't want to "kill the goose that lays the golden egg?" Hundreds of millions have been spent on cancer research, yet with very little progress. Of course, once a cure is found, no more millions coming in. Greed is such a beautiful thing. Just wondering!&&&2
No. 2 Kahuku returns to its roots - Sports News&&&Message to any Hawaii student athelete wanting to play in the state of Oregon after High School, Sign with OSU or PSU, but never NEVER EVER sign with the University of Oregon.

I have read hundreds of repugnant posts on this forum that have never been removed and I have to say that my post was 100% decent. I guess that my comment on got a socialist Akaka Bill supporter there at your newspaper very upset. Or maybe it was Mr. Dyke himself. Too bad.&&&3
Maui feels recession's pain - Hawaii Business&&&Maui, like the rest of the State, is hurting for tourist. Those they get are cheap - ABC stores, Costco, K-Mart... HC&S looks like its on its last legs too. I always hear of the "cane burning" being a big issue for the haoles/new arrivals who live in Kihei. I wonder if those people will put their personal adgendas ahead of the good of Maui? My bet is they will!&&&22

Parents put on trial over neglected child - Hawaii News&&&"Although Loy said Wright failed to provide her daughter with "adequate nutritional" support, she did not intend to kill her." It probably would have been a blessing if she had passed on. "The couple had been charged in 2000 with misdemeanor endangering the welfare of a minor. Both were granted a one-year deferral after Denise pleaded guilty and Melvin pleaded no contest." Here's obviously one that fell through the huge cracks that exist in Children and Family Services. The social worker should also be charged in this horrible incident.&&&20
Let's save handshakes until after the games - Hawaii Sports&&&I remember watching a rugby game once. It was an all poly team against a team from California.

No rest for the Warriors after slim opening victory - Sports News&&&I know this may sound sacrilegious but why cant we convert someone to a blocking TE? That way we could have an extra guy to protect the QB. He could even run some quick out routes and pick up some 1st downs. By using an empty backfield we wont lose the run and shoot philosophy either.&&&4

Sad for those did not make it back but it is a celebration in my heart after all that hard work you have done. Welcome back...&&&1
No. 2 Kahuku returns to its roots - Hawaii Sports&&&Kahuku, the number 2 team in the state has a stout defense (but not against the pass) and a very questionable offense. Not a balanced team at all.&&&2
Copper thieves strike troubled Hoku plant in Idaho&&&There are different cities in the USA that have implemented a successful "3 day waiting period" before recycling customers can recieve a check for the copper they bring in at recycling plants. Besides law inforcement being notified of large thefts of copper from businesses the local recyclers would be notified as well. Many thieves are unaware of this law and when told they have to wait 3 days for their check they never come back. This would initiate an investigation of the individual(s). A contact list (business names and phone numbers) of recent and past thefts of copper would be distributed (by law enforcement) to all recycle plants. During the 3 day waiting period affected businesses would be called by the Recycling plant when recieving large amounts of copper. This should not only cut down on copper thefts but have these criminals suffer the consequences of their unlawful actions.&&&1

Short snaps: UH vs. Central Arkansas - Hawaii Sports&&&I just dont know....UH looked horrible last night, It seems alexander wants to throw long all the time, he doesnt work the offense. Leon Wright Jackson? when will he show up, I have been waiting 2 seasons for him to shine. Pilares? HE is like a gurl out there, so tentative. and the defense looks small and lost. Overall Alexander is so inconsistent and has no rhithum, it will be a long painful season.&&&1
Arbitrator closes state hearings - Hawaii News&&&Arbitration should be in closed doors because the media or the public will misinterpret the discussions. Let the State and HGEA haggle and the Arbitrator decide the outcome. The problem will be if both sides will honor the decision. It's a shame when an outsider has to come and settle our problem but so be it.&&&35

Back in the Day: July 19, 1957 - Hawaii Editorials&&&it is impressive that people in 1957 rejected fluoridation, because there was great pressure to dump that industrial toxic waaste into our water systems. The research now shows they had great wisdom and avoided lower IQ and bone cancer in children and broken hips, thyroid problems and cancer in older people. See ( ) for rhe facts.&&&2
Denied 'one last chance,' man sent to prison - Hawaii News&&&"Carl Cornelle Jr., who killed a 65-year-old woman while high on drugs and alcohol in a 1999 traffic collision, asked a judge yesterday for probation." Interesting journalistic writing...the paper makes it look like the victim was high on drugs and alcohol. Anyway,why did they keep giving this guy so many chances? He gets kicked out of rehab, breaks every promise...he should just be locked away forever...He'll just come out and start drinking and driving all over again. How many more people will he kill? This state has got to get tougher DUI laws.&&&40

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&"When the U.S. president admits that the overthrow of the indigenous government was illegal, "subdued" statehood celebrations -- if any -- are appropriate. I wish the Hawaiian viewpoint had not been at the very end of your special 50-year section (Aug. 19). Still, that did give them the last word. May it be so." Exactly. It's not a good thing to celebrate a lie and a theft. This does not extrapolate to "being politically correct." Instead it's called "doing the right thing." But as usual some Americans gotta open their mouths and show their ignorance and racism singling out and targeting Hawaiians based on their national origin. By the way I was way in the front of the rally. Long live the Hawaiian Kingdom... while some American buffoons want to celebrate a lie and a theft and insist on doing so LOL&&&122

"Stay thirsty my friends!"&&&11

Maryknoll School finally has a gym after 82 years - Hawaii News&&&Good for them! The lack of a gym was one of the factors in NOT choosing to go to Maryknoll when looking for a high school to go to (in '98). It seemed pretty sad that a private school of medium size didn't have a gym of their own. I'm sure this was one of the reasons that many others didn't attend as well.&&&5

Hawaii AD dealing with disgruntled supporters - Hawaii Sports&&&Yes - I support Hawaii Athletics but on this one .... oh man. Many of the 400 that were turned away are some of the athletic department firm supporters. The handling of the situation is the problem especially when people were "guaranteed" parking passes. Even a courtesy phone call ... just about 400 would have lessened the "sting". It's no wonder that UH has difficulty attracting alumni and broader community financial support. Another "fumble" by the fund raising arm of the UH.... sad, very sad.&&&15

UH Lab School seniors cook up a new cookbook - Hawaii Features&&&I purchased a cookbook from a senior from UH Lab and found a lot of interesting recipes.

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Great question Nick....Where are our representatives? Most likely they felt this token phone call would pacify the masses. How little credit they give us these days. We have legitimate questions and we deserve legitimate answers. This shows no respect for the people. We don't matter. Silence speaks volumns and I guess they agree with all that is going on. Personally, I know some adjustments need to be made, but I want to know why over 220 million that are happy with insurance have to give up theirs for the rest? They are campaigning on incorrect numbers that have been corrected time and again. I want to know if congress is going to use the same insurance they want to put us on without the benefit of private insurance? I want to know, how long will I be covered? How much is all this going to cost? Why do we have to pay for those that are illegal and never paid into the system. We already know this is bankrupting the country, so why not leave the ones already happily insured alone? This tells me, there is an underlying movement going on. If this is the service we get, perhaps, we should get to vote on any future raises.&&&13
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Aloha: If the smell bill had passed, imagine this scenario, repeated all over O`ahu. A TSA agent at a bus stop, sniffing everyone as they try to board. "I really don't care how you smell, but I'll decide whether you get on this bus or not. Do you understand me? I'm the law around here." "Did you bathe this morning? What do you mean, the park where you live doesn't have a shower? I'm sorry, but you may not ride on a City bus as others might find your smell offensive. "Take a shower and come back. Take a pill for that garlic smell that exudes from your pores. Quit smoking as most people find that smell of stale tobacco smoke from your hair and clothes offensive. Stop using so much cologne as it is offensive and does not take the place of bathing. "I'm a government official and I say you may not ride in TheBus." By that time, TheBus has already left anyway, so its a moot point. And the Sniff Police person saying "I stopped another person from smelling up TheBus. I earned my salary. When will they ever learn?" Me ka pono, Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&23
Feds owe more to migrants - Hawaii Editorials&&&Yes, the Feds are responsible and NOT THE STATE GOVT. and the Micronesian advocates and esp. the Federal Judge who issued a tro on health benefits by the state should get their act together. Why is the State responsible for providing health care to these people?? The Federal Judge should have taken notice to that but he's a political puppet and these Micro advocates have got their facts wrong and if I was the governor I would have called for the Deputy Sheriffs and physically removed these idiots from sitting in her office several days ago. Nothing more and nothing less.&&&21

Repairs at Kailua center expected to be done soon - Hawaii News&&&It is unfortunate that a "simple" bureaucrat doesn't seem to understand that those who don't have funds cannot and shouldn't be spending money and more energy buying things on a daily basis rather than putting goods in a freezer that help extend either meals or food supplies. Stop reading the fricking manual and start using some of the brain cells most human beings have. Use some of that human creativity, maybe to put the freezers on the approved list instead of letting "the government" tell you what to do, and still let those that want to absorb the electrical cost.&&&1

Oregon wants 'dog friendly' to be less so - New York Times&&&that's true, local girl. I just moved out of an apartment complex overrun with dog poop where there used to be clean green grass for humans. Now you can't walk through the grass let alone sit on it. Terrible shame, no more habitat for humans..... dogs and cats are well known to carry parasites that humans get, but you can bet their owners rarely worm themselves, if they do worm their pets...... something's wrong when it gets so out of hand and impacts people badly.&&&1
Unhealthy lifestyles raise cost of health care - Hawaii Editorials&&&Corporate America, namely the pharmaceutical-agribusiness complex, spends millions every year on lobbyists to insure that no legislation passes that will make Americans less sick. They need a kick in the "you know where." To place the onus on those who are "subliminally seduced" every day on TV and media advertisements to eat more fatty, sugar-laden foods and to alleviate the symptoms of their food-induced ailments with drugs is skirting the crux of the problem.&&&28
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&"I feel sad for that minor group of people of Hawaii who oppose and despise statehood. There are many of us in these islands who benefit from statehood." Don't feel sad for them. They should be proud of themselves standing up against celebrating a lie and a theft. "We are the strongest and leader of democracy. We don't have to worry about our pension and security because the U.S. will never go bankrupt." The U.S. is already in massive debt: While Obama is in office it is projected to double.&&&8

Rebuild rundown urban Oahu instead of paving prime Ewa farmland...&&&I agree with Rep. Cabanilla. The blighted areas and the infrastuctures should be considered first. Re-gentrify the downtown areas, insure public tranportation supports the movement of the population around the island (i.e. for employment). The cost of living is already high, the average worker can barely make ends meet. What makes you think they can afford newer housing? Besides that the 2K jobs that the project could bring in, would likely be to work on the project itself. What happens after the work is completed.&&&34
Wahine roll over Billikens - Sports News&&&Texas is a final 4 team....the wahine are not....not yet.... JMO. Still, we have made solid improvement over last year and Hawaii is a bonafide top 10 team with high value athletes. Coach Dave and staff have done well in preping his wahine in the off-season and they need to play above the net against the lady Longhorns to give themselves a shot at an upset....this game will not define our season, but it will provide a measuring stick for our wahine if they are entertaining any thoughts of a national championship. Like a cruise missle, you can bet Texas has it sights set on St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa.&&&2
Heading into the 'unknown' - Special Projects&&&If it wasn't for the super easy schedule UH would be at the bottom. UH players are too swell headed talking big and losing big. They should be quiet and practice hard and show their stuff game time. A 7-7 season is a dream, if they can beat one average team it would be a miracle of fixed game. Maybe they can beat Aiea, Roosevelt, Kalani, or Pop Warner teams.&&&3

Hawaii Baptist serves up win - Sports News&&&Top Coaches - 1. Chris Blake, Kamehameha - Hard to argue with 4 straight state titles. 5 in a row could seal Coach Blake's place atop this list. Gets the players and parents on board. A daunting task on the hill. 2. Jim Iams, Punahou - Struggled the first couple years putting his stamp on the program. The Puns are playing Coach Iam's system and having more success. Program is on a upswing. 3. Anela Vendiola, Kahuku - Graduating majority of your starters, onlookers thought the Red Raiders would be down this year, there's no such thing as rebuilding on tne North Shore. All of her players Varsity and JV believe and buy into what Coach Vediola is selling. 4. LeeAnn Satale, Word of Life - Although she might not have the most talent to work with, Coach Satale is able to teach her players about more than just volleyball. Her rapport with her players is unmatched. Players respect and enjoy playing for her. 5. Jenic Tumaneng, Iolani - Still trying to put his imprint on the Raider program. An ILH or State title could do the trick. He was a good coach at Farrington and has remained the same person at Iolani. Many others have failed when switching from the OIA to ILH. 6. Tommy Lake, Moanalua - Every season rumors run around regarding team chemistry, parent complaints, but Coach Lake is still around coaching championship level teams at Moanalua. His teams are always peaking at the end of the season. 7. Chad DelaNoza, Waimea - Tucked away on the Westside of Kauai is a very talented coach. Most of the top coaches on this list comment how much Coach DelaNoza gets out of his teams. 8. Walt Quintan, UHS - Longtime Jr. Bows coach is loyal to his alma matar. Not blessed with year around volleyball players like his counterparts, Coach Quintan always gets his teams to exceed expectations. 9. Lee Ann Maikui, Waiakea - A longtime fixture in Big Island volleyball scene, Coach Maikui has her Warrior program poised to make waves across the state for many seasons to come. She understands the importance of volleyball in the community and works with the families. 10. Charles Spencer, Kamehameha-Maui - When Coach Spencer moved to Maui for Oahu, many thought it would be difficult to transform KS-Maui into a state contender. Maybe a year away but no one has built a program for the beginning to legitimate state contender.&&&1

Depending on how much she wieghed. It is quite possible there are two involved if not more. Has anyone noticed ow the crime wave has risen? It will continue to rise with the influx of immigrants and no background checks. It will continue to rise if there is not a crack down on drugs. The illegal importation an exportation of narcotics into and out of Hawaii is real and ongoing.. Hawaii is no different than anywhere else. Beautiful, political corruption, police corruption and a whole lot of drugs entering the state from the mailand and Asia. The people have to elect officials who will take care of this mess. It is not on who you know! It's about what you know and what are you going to do to solve this ongoing problem. The Bust of those HPD Officers is just the start of a corrupt state.. We all live here and we all want the best for our families. You see some funky things happening in your neighborhood report it..If you don't trust the local authorities..Contact the DEA or FBI!

Panel might restrict clubs' hours - Hawaii News&&&Shut them down. Primary concern is the safety of the public. Steps only recently taken, in cosmetic reaction to matters brought before the commission earlier, suggest these subsequent actions are being staged just to get past the commission making the right decision. The safest decision would be to shut all of the three clubs at 2:00 a.m., to remove Black Diamond's crying about loss of revenue, which is really a "you not being fair, you letting Da Shack and Zanzabar stay open to 4" argument. Hats off to our cops for having to put up with that b.s., and see, despite that vegas-weed isolated accusation, we still get good, common sense ones like Captain Richards, who calls it straight about the drunks and their "little dramas." I got news for you folks. It's all drama. When you go Waikiki for drink and get stupid it really is a pathetic attempt to act out delusional drama fueled by alcohol which, by itself, is no problem, but when our cops and the regular folks and our tourists have to walk thru that nonsense, that is a safety concern that should be directly addressed by the liquor commission. My suggestion is, close them at 2 a.m. NOT 4.&&&53

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mark Koppel - you of course have REAL stats to back up your clims right? Not projections, not guesses, real numbers. If what you say is true, why would anyone fly the thousands of miles to get "civil unioned" only to return to their home state and not have it recognized (unless they just happen to be from one of the very few that do, in which case they culd just get "civil unioned there")? I have said this before, this is NOT a valid reason to pass a civil union law. It might very well be a good thing to do but it has ZERO to do with tourist dollars. Get DOMA revolked, get the majority of states to recognized the unions THEN get Hawaii to pass the law.&&&41

Theodore H.S. Hong editorial/re: G.E.T. tax increase&&&I see the management of this paper decided, all too quickly, to pull Ted Hong's comments/editorial (sept. 02, 2009) regarding the preposterous notion of raising the general excise tax in Hawaii. Ted was absolutely correct in his proposal; the problem is that this was nothing more than a diversional "RED HERRING" THAT ONLY THE UNFAMILIAR LAYMEN PROPORTED. Given the hidden one billion dollars in a ridiculous scheme (to hide taxpayers' dollars off the books) shows, clearly that the state has the abiltiy to pay employees without the "scare tactics of layoffs and furloughs" plus have monies to pay for needed social services. The economy in the mainland will improve as economic data arrives showing July's reports of increased volume in durable goods production rising...no company in it's right mind increases inventories or production capacities without being associated with consumer's "pent-up demands"/purchasing" propensities also. With this, consumers will tire of being pent up in their houses, will look at their ever-increasing savings, and decide that it's time to get away from it all...Hawaii stands to gain from this mentality in some percentage quotient or another. Quit listening to the "doom and gloom" from a frustrated, love-lost govenor; she'll go in a matter of months anyway to the place of her choosing (with your tax-paid retirement and life-long healthcare). She'll survive quite well as opposed to the rank and file workers. She was nothing more than a "blip"/"flash in the pan" amusement...a diversion from the old-boy Democrats. The money is there, providing she doesn't lose more than the $114 million dollars she gambled-away already. Keep the faith, have hope, she and her cadre' will be gone in due time...we'll breath easier after this eight-year dalliance!!!&&&1

Increasing excise tax would only compound financial misery - Ha...&&&I retired on a company union pension many years ago.

Police and Fire - Newswatch&&&Judge Glenn Hara should be put in prison as well. Mr. Bailey is obviously a serial offender. 4 counts last year for attempted sexual assault after being paroled for the murder of a 17 year old girl. I'll bet she was sexually assaulted too. Maybe Judge Hara was asleep at the throne. Amazing, he repeated this again. I would never leave one of my children with any church member, ALONE! I am not one to jusge, but I am not one to forgive . Did the Pastor not check out this man who was working for them? There is a website you can go to and type your address in to find out who and where registered sex offerenders are i your neighborhood. It is chilling!&&&2

Star-Bulletin football and volleyball Top 10 - Hawaii Sports&&&St Louis will have to improve their weak and porous defense if they expect to continue their winning ways. Kamehameha's offense will test the Crusaders defensive armor when they next meet. In the last St. Louis wins over Waianae and Leilehua it seemed St. Louis' defensive team ran out of steam in the second half thus, allowing points to be scored at will to narrow their points winning margin. Kamehameha has the second best offensive scoring team in the league and the Crusaders defense will be tested against Kams scoring machine. Kamehameha is superior to both Waianae and Leilehua and should take the Crusaders challenge on an even level. Prediction: Kamehameha 27, St. Louis 19.&&&6

Prompt action needed to deter pilot fatigue - Hawaii Editorials&&&Strict rules have to be made soon. I was astonished when I spoke to a young pilot who shrugged off BOTH pilots dozing off while flying as a common and unavoidable occurrence! He claims that, "That's what autopilot is for." I don't blame him for the current weak policies though I do resent that his lack of regard for his own safety is extended to his passengers. I'm also sure most veteran pilots don't take the problem so lightly! I appreciate that he and others feel that they can't make waves without risking their jobs, but I sure don't want to be on his plane when he and his co-pilot doze off! Perhaps those who don't speak up on their own would join in an organized strike for everyone's safety. Or am I a just worrywart? Autopilot my butt.&&&2

Brief asides - SB Editorials&&&Too bad we here in Hawaii can't benefit from the impact of productive colleagues.

Honolulu seeking to ban 'BO' on buses&&&Well I guess that would be a good way for the cities to make some extra money during these bad economic times !

Ho'opili project doesn't fit Hawaii's renewed focus on a sustai...&&&I have followed this discussion without have formed an opinion yet on whether development of Ho'opili is a good thing or a bad thing. I see merits on both sides of the argument. But one of the discussions that has not been raised (or maybe I've missed it) is the economic feasibility of farming. The State can preserve this land for ag uses but will anyone actually farm it? Does it make economic sense for someone - an individual or a corporate entity - to actually farm it and be able to make a living at it? Just a thought.&&&1
North Shore shark tours OK, study finds - Hawaii News&&&Can't believe people were trying to ban the tours in the first place, especially when there is not a single piece of fact-based evidence that suggests these shark tours increase the chances of attacks on humans. Its okay to have a healthy fear of sharks, but its another thing to use a natural fear as leverage to close an industry. And Hawaii needs any revenue stream in can get at this time. Lets support local business, not create more barriers.&&&303

Time for an increase in pay and bennies they say. Raise taxes on everyone so our members have more money. So typical of our third world managed unions. We are all in this together and must fairly share the pain. Same for Hawaiian Airline pilots who also haven't got a clue. We will strike they say, we need more money. What loosers they are. Go ahead and strike, other airlines will gladly take your passengers. Such greedy, clueless fools these pilots are. No spirit of aloha in our islands today. Just what is in it for me. Ahhhh, another day in the Nei.&&&21

our schools have failed&&&Our schools have failed. Some forty years ago, many people started to realize that our schools were failing. Today, more people realize that it has failed. The DOE under Superintendent Hamamoto in her eight year reign has grown from a $1.3 billion educational budget to a massive $2.3 billion budget as it stands today. In this same period, the 7,000 educational support staff has nearly doubled to 13,5000 in the central office. However, the ironic part of this story is that the quality of education went on an extreme downslide that we now occupy the 49th position in the Union. More money or more administrative support staff that does not support the clasroom teacher is not the answer. More money redirected to the classrooms and support of teachers in the classrooms in regards to disciplining students is the answer. However, if you follow the DOE/BOE and their actions or inactions over the past four decades, you can conclude that they are not focusing in this area at all. The DOE/BOE are both afraid to take back control of our schools. Instead they are treating the symptoms and will not take the time and effort to build a solid school foundation. The right leadership by both the DOE and BOE has the power to correct our failing school system.&&&4
Stabbing suspect is mentally unfit, judge concludes - Hawaii News&&&He fatally stabs the mother, attempts to stab the father to death, but only cuts the two year old on the arm.

Weekly Eater: Spada aims high&&&For those people that left five stars I must ask if you think Olive Garden is good. This one if not the worst Italian restaurant I have ever been at. Not only is the food so bland its like eating baby food but the Head waiter is so arrogant you just wanted to slap him upside his head. I ordered four different items. The antipasto which was bad cheese and the worse cold cuts every presented. The second dish was there Pizza. If you like little Cesar's you ill love there's. Cheapest toppings I have ever eaten on a pizza and soggy beyond believe. There special was Fettuccini Alfredo. I will say that of all the things I have complained about this was the worst. It tasted like you where eating past on an overdone noodle. I asked them if this was al dente and there answer was I have no idea what I am talking about. The blond haired head waiter asked if I have ever eaten Italian food. My answer was yes and this is not Italian food. I agree with one of the critics that the tiramisu was just about as bad as everything else. Bottom line if you like to spend money on bad food a service this is your place&&&1

Save fertile soil at Ho'opili site - Hawaii Editorials&&&It will be interesting to see how this farm or build decision is decided. Money in the hand now and live from mainland ship deliveries forever? Or grow food locally and keep a little bit of "Island Style" to show the grandkids. It's either one or the other, you can't have both. It's worth pointing out that developers never give up. They'll be back year after year with different slick presentations, different field trips and other grease for politicians. One little mistake by farmers and people who care about local food production and the excavators will be transporting all that prime topsoil to the dump.&&&18

Electric car proposal has state charged up - Hawaii News&&&It would seem that Hawaii is unable to take care of our self; we have to let an out of the country corporation come in and charge us a hefty profit for the power we produce. They plan to sell you the power Hawaii makes and tack on a profit that goes out of the country. Sure they are making an investment putting in the stations, but they will profits 100 times over. There are EV charging stations available made in the US that anyone can own and operate. Put them up at your business and provide a sustainable charging service for your customers. EVs are for sale in Hawaii now! Highway speed vehicles at an affordable cost, install solar and wind power at your home or business and charge your EV from renewable yourself. Big corporations are lined up all the time to come into Hawaii and take profits out of the state. Better place plans to take it out of your pocket and out of the country. We propose a Mo BehTah Place where Hawaii businesses own and operate charging stations, with tax incentives over 50% and FED grants we could install the stations at almost no cost and wind or solar power is eligible for the same incentives if used to charge EV in Hawaii. Our EVs are available now not 2 years from now, and we plan to build them here in Hawaii putting local labor to work and using only local investors. Keeping the profits in Hawaii as a sustainable business model we need to create jobs local building the solutions, affordable EVs, installing the charging stations with wind and solar power. Why is the state supporting a foreign corporation in a plan that would charge us more for charging then the actual cost? Someone has to put the stations in, owned and operate them. Why not Hawaii Business owners and let them keep the profits! Linda I vote for a Mo BehTah Place...&&&1

Either way he's an embarrassment and a joke. But then why should he be considered that much different from most other elected officials.&&&152

Attempted-killing charges dropped - Hawaii News&&&Outstanding job by renown criminal defense attorney, Walter Rodby, who here demonstrates, yet again, his impeccable ability and legal acumen in assisting his client in clearing his name. Hats off to Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Franklin Pacarro, Jr., who here demonstrates integrity and honor, willing to forgo an unnecessary public t.v. trial drama that would have advanced his own career, and instead, does the right thing, in dismissing the charges against the accused. So, let me get this straight. The "victim" or "complainer" witness and his friends went over to these guys house area, the victim and his friends when go start the trouble, but the victim when lose, got his head cracked open, and then when go file one false police report and blame these guys? And to think, these defendants when sit in jail cuz couldn't raise bail. Getting his head cracked open. That must've really hurt, huh.&&&18

Prisons policy puts community at risk - Hawaii Editorials&&&Did Cynthia Oi change her name to Kat Brady? Because this commentary has as much deception and misguided thinking as a typical Oi offering. Brady keeps making it sound like most criminals are "non-violent" offenders who don't really deserve punishment yet are locked up at the drop of a hat. How does she think "non-violent" druggies are getting the money to support their habit? Answer: by breaking into your car, burglarizing your home and stealing from your company. Hasn't she ever had all her stuff stolen from a locked car or locked home? That might not be "violent" to her but it is still devastating to the victim. Is she counting DUI offenders as "non-violent"? What about when those DUI miscreants hit and kill someone? Is she saying we should wait until that happens before getting serious about taking them off the road? In fact, that appears to be what we do. Based on countless news articles, plus what I've heard from victims and even defense attorneys, the justice system is incredibly lenient to people convicted of DUI. How long was Tadd Fujikawa's father dealing meth before he finally got caught? Then all he gets is a "10-year" sentence that will really mean only a year in prison. How would Ms. Brady feel if Fujikawa had sold meth to her son or daughter? Would she still feel so sorry for him? Yes, everyone agrees we should offer inmates drug rehab and job training. But Brady's preferred solution appears to include quickly letting them all back out on the street so they can get right back to committing crimes. Here's a news flash to Brady: Mr. Drunk and Ms. Druggie can't victimize me while they are behind bars and that's the way I like it. Contrary to what she would have you believe, it is not that difficult to stay out of prison. The vast majority of people, even the homeless in the parks, manage to do it. If you are too dumb or dysfunctional to avoid the criminal justice system then I don't want you as my neighbor.&&&10
Shortfall revised upward to $876M - Hawaii News&&&Now is the time, the time is now, for the State holding the power to collect the .5 per cent rail tax, to withhold delivery of such tax to Mufi, and instead use that State power collected tax for purposes other than Mufi-union-and-crony-enrichmen t. Mufi when lie to us about how much this rail-pig supposed to cost. He and Yoshioka even when lie to the feds. Do We Need It? No. Can We Afford It? No. Can We Maintain It?(Why even ask that question if we neither need it nor can we afford it.) No. First things first. These declining state revenue figures, only make clearer the more obvious: we are in dire economic straights. Look at the restaurants. Look at the parking lots at the malls. Look at your wallet. Only a lounge lizard, in a smoke filled bar, who imagines himself to be a Don Ho-Frank Sinatra impersonating singer, and who so also happened to have been elected Mayor of Honolulu, would think it is okay to bleed the financially-strapped tax-payer to enrich his union cronies and the sorted cast of characters to profit off of the cluttering, congesting and cubicle-ization of Honolulu. Go Mufi Go. Beat it.&&&58
Rights panel against Akaka Bill - Hawaii News&&&The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights conveniently made no mention of the rights denied the multi-racial citizens of the U.S. Territory of Hawaii in the illegitimate voting ballot for statehood. That's 90% of the then voting population(so they say). Many are still alive today. I wonder what goes through their minds knowing that the ballot was tainted and their civil rights were compromised? Do they simply say it doesn't matter any longer? There's nothing that can be done? Or do they consciously make an effort to fight that "harmful precedent" and support those that seek justice? The longest river in Egypt? (The Nile)&&&66

22 states require fire-safe cigarettes - News&&&Fire-safe cigarettes is not the answere to preventing fires and death, education is. Far more important than making fire-safe cigarettes is making fire-safe ash trays. Most ash trays you see sold on the market are designed to allow the cigarette to easily roll off, causing many fires and deaths. There should be stiff laws to prevent the sale of ash trays that are not fire-safe in design. Also, cigarettes are sold with a warning label that they are harmful. I believe that it would be better to show on the package ythe difference between a fire-safe ash tray and a non-safe ash tray, and that puffing on a cigarette is likely to cause less cancer and breathing problems than inhaling the smoke. Further, other more advanced countries like Thailand put anti-cancer causing agents in their tobacco research. I often wonder how many lives could have been saved by simply using fire-proof ash trays and telling young adults not to inhale the smoke. I think it should be taught in high schools how to smoke, if you must, a cigarette properly so as to cause little or no lung damage. And a shop class on how to make your own safe, idiot-proof ashtray. Hell will freeze over before telling people they can no longer smoke cigarettes; global warming supports this idea.&&&86
Damien nurtures its Aina - Sports News&&&This is ridiculous. Damien looks simply awful in the two games that they have played. I remember several years ago when they had two co-head coaches and Damien really could compete and under one of the coaches several players went to play for top Division 1 schools and couple are still playing for Colorado and Arizona. Having this family for coaches have led to a discombobulated team where they seem not to know what they are doing on the field.&&&2
Akaka Bill a zero-sum game, not 'win-win' - Guest Editorials&&&By using 1778 as the cutoff point for being considered Hawaiian ignores the people from other nations who later came to live in Hawaii. Those who were citizens of Hawaii and who were here for the overthrow were impacted in equal fashion with those of Hawaiian blood. That the Akaka bill ignores the impact the the U.S. supposedly had on them demonstrates the racial basis of the bill.&&&3

Farm owners face visa counts - Hawaii News&&&The ugly other side of the ag land struggle is visible here; let's call it what it is: SLAVERY pure and simple. Just as the farm workers on the mainland are making less money now relative to thirty years ago, it seems that the land of aloha, too, enjoys the fruits of bondage. So it will be difficult to make a very sweet argument to save these farmlands from development when the alternative is something as ugly as this. The perpetrators should be jailed with a million dollar bail per each enslaved person; the piddling amounts reported won't even cause a squeak, given the huge cash amounts sloshing around among these crooks. Lock them up.&&&25

Now they get to see what kind of "rats" they were hanging out and around with when the trial begin. Just another form of slavery, the drug world is filled with this type of two-faced, back-stabbing, turn-coat, testifying types against the more despicable mental slave owner drug dealers profitting off the misery of the addicts. You think you getting "high," but you only going "real low" and then, later on, "too slow" and "too old," after they lock you up long time.&&&8

Newswatch - Newswatch&&&What is the rationale behind allowing those persons/families that are receiving rental assistance from the government in purchasing a house? How will they be able to afford to repair it if they can't even afford to pay rent? Where is the responsibility that comes with ownership when the cost of everything comes from your own pocket? I foresee a lot of these homes falling in to disrepair within 1-5 years of ownership and slums developing if too many are gathered in one area. It's a novel idea, but not well thought out and all the consequences haven't been explored yet (like who is paying for this extravagance?)&&&1

Wahine already give us a reason to be excited - Further Review&&&Good match for the fans especially the UCLA haters in the crowd as well as a strong effort by the team. However the Bruins are very young (7 frosh and 7 sophomores on the squad), and they are replacing an All-American setter with a freshman. The Achilles heel for our program continues to be the woeful conference schedule with no challenges until the postseason. Nothing but preseason nonconference home matches is not the greatest plan either. Somehow scheduling a tough non-conference opponent on the road during the regular season might be helpful to lessen the chance of playoff disappointments.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Jan Blichfeldt, great letter! Although I'm absolutely certain that the brain dead right-wing nutbars will find some ridiculous made-up reason why the U.S. is better with Big Insurance setting all the rules and rationing health care, while running the entire show. I can only hope that our Democratic lawmakers grow themselves some balls, climb out of the pockets of Big Insurance, and just use whatever means necessary to get a Public Option for the American people, even if it means reconciliation. You own single payer, cradle-to-grave health care, which was there before you were born 80 years ago, is a true testament to what can be achieved by thinking, caring and rational people. As you have seen through the media, Big Insurance backed groups who bring guns & Hitler signs to health care "debates" is our preferred method of reform here in the good old U.S.A.&&&165

New approach to the flu - Hawaii Editorials&&&I'm against the flu shots. Not enough testing was done. No one even knows the correct dosage to give for sure. Our kids will be the first ones to get the shoots. The vaccine is coming from a foreign country I understand and also don't you think the pharmaceutical companies are making big bucks from foreign countries off of our kids? I have a list of other reasons too, but note it's very possible the shots will be worse than the actual swine flu itself.&&&3

Pasta & Basta is 'finito' - Columnists&&&The problem with this place wasn't the food (which was excellent), it was the speed of service. I have eaten there several times, and each time the wait is ridiculous. It is impossible to have a "business lunch" when it takes 40 minutes to 1 hour to get your food. Same goes for people who have jury-duty and need a quick lunch walking distance from the court house. I have seen people at lunch, disgusted with the long wait, wait to the counter and demand a refund. How embarrassing. I have even ordered take-out in the evening after work, with disappointing results. Example - I order my food, arrive 30 minutes later and still have to wait 20-30 minutes more. It's just too much easier to go to any other Italian restaurant in Honolulu and not have to put up with that type of wait. Ironically, the restaurant's website said fine dining "without the bullsh..." I think there is no other way to describe that ridiculous wait time, other than B.S. Sorry Donato, you misread your audience. It was arrogant to think, that even at bargain prices, people will sit and wait forever, even for quality food, at a counter-service style restaurant. That is why this place failed. Not due to the recession or any other excuses given in the article.&&&1

I had to work hard, deny myself certain luxuries/entertainment so I could have enough for a down payment. I guess pride, work ethics and responsibility are no longer a requirement. It's no wonder that everything is moving off-shore.

City touts 'bike friendliness' of rail - Hawaii News&&&Wow! I suddenly believe the City, even with confirmed liar, Yoshioka, yakking again. I am especially impressed with the "even if we don't do anything" mufi minion Chris Sayer line, where he predicts that we will all magically jump on a bike after the rail-pig painted "Soilent Green" finishes feeding and depleting our city treasury. We need dedicated, barricaded, protected, bike lanes to PROTECT the riders. I am especially heartened by Yoshioka's "less than ideal" bike accomodations, which pretty much confirms Sayers earlier "we not going do nothing." In otherwords folks, more bogusness and bogacity from the bogacious. Eh, Yoshioka, it is "inappropriate" for you to represent our City in any capacity. Firstly, you should consider hitting the gym, as you are sightly-unpleasing and diminish the aesthetic beauty of Honolulu.(Last thing we need to see on t.v. is you visually polluting Honolulu.) Go ahead, jump on a bike and show us all just how brave you really are. It will do wonders for you, and may help us tax-payers out in your end.&&&65

'Iolani makes the play - Hawaii Sports&&&I rememeber when Iolani's uniforms were all red. Thats why their nickname was the "Red Raiders". Usually they don't name fields after people unitl they die, but Eddie Hama-da is such a fine human being who did so much for Iolani that they went ahead and honored him while he is still alive. Good for him to have gotten his one Prep Bowl win, when his team annihilated Waianae, ending the Seariders era of dominance. The Waianae football program has not been the same since that whipping they took in the 1980 Prep Bowl, a game that still holds the record for all-time attendance at a Hawai'i high school game.&&&8

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Perhaphs if the parks were opened for the homeless to use at night, that would get them off the streets and bus stops. This would be a better approach to have them away from the public at night. Sidewalks would be free and clear from these beggers of the night. By doing so, Honolulu would feel alot safer. Bus stops would be unoccupied by the homeless allowing us to sit while waiting for the bus. It's a difficult balance the city must take by Lester Chang's department. The sooner this situation is resolved, the better off the homeless, City and County, and the public will be in.&&&3

Hawaii entrepreneurs feeding on bandwidth - Tech View&&&More people in Hawaii should consider starting on-line businesses. Selling a product on-line removes a significant barrier for Hawaii companies - flying to customers in the mainland or Asia. Also, start-up costs can be trivial, especially for individuals with programming experience. I only launched my company 16 months ago and it's already profitable. On-line is also good for the state's economy. 99% of my 700+ customers are from outside Hawaii (with over half outside the US). This means it brings new money into the state. If anyone is interested in starting an on-line business, I would be happy to provide feedback. My email is jhonovich@ipvideomarket.info Finally and for the record, I was Director of Product Management for the Silicon Valley Company. I ran product management, not the company.&&&1

Utah State excited about QB Borel's second season - Hawaii Sports&&&Borel rushed for more yards in a game than Hawaii averaged per game as a team. So who said Hawaii does not need to be an effective rushing team to win games? "We're not real big, so we have to keep people guessing," Andersen said. "We have to be able to run and move and cause people some problems in understanding where we are." Hawaii??? Sounds like we can take a lesson here. And this also sounds like how Boise St. plays; they keep us guessing what they're going to do each and every play.&&&1

The key is to have them face lots of 3rd and long situations. Kaepernick will likely throw an INT or two when pressured. The guy is a lot like UW's QB in my book: a great runner, but an average arm. Hawaii can win against Nevada. Go Warriors!&&&2

D-line's depth is put to the test - Hawaii Sports&&&Hawaii can qualify for their own non-BCS bowl. But if Hawaii does not invest to make the program comparable to the big 6 schools, then Hawaii should expect to beat inferior competition to get to a low to mid tier bowl game. Remember go blue (ie Florida, Notre Dame, Penn State, Michigan, Boise State, Cal). Actually the Oregon State transfer playing guard can make immediate contributions to the offensive line this year. While Hawaii's defensive depth may have taken another hit, this provides other people the opportunity to rise up in the system. Did you see that i'm a warrior commercial on TV?&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&"kanaka maoli still have the highest rates of illiteracy, disease and poverty, and lack the positive self-image and access to human development." True, so who do we blame for these blights among the kanaka maoli? 1. Rates of illiteracy! That's what public schools are for is to educate those who want to get ahead. 2. Disease! Health care has been and is available, even if you can't afford it. Those living in apartment or house on the slopes of Manoa or Hawaii Kai, pick up the tab. 3. Poverty! Refer to 1 above. Case in point, the Vietnamese. Came to our country, unable to speak our language, new to our customs and traditions. Yet, they graduate as Valedictorians and go on to become doctors, attorneys, and other professional callings. 4. Lack of positive self-image! Simply an excuse for failure. 5. Access to human development! Again I refer you to 1. and 3. above. So all-in-all those items you mention cannot be given, but rather earned by the kanaka maoli. It must come from inside.&&&8

Our Super Big Time Gals from Hawaii annihilated that all upperclassmen returning team from the mid-west. Oh, did you miss that one, LYLE? WE WON BIG TIME. And it only took 88 minutes. The new Terraflex court, the blessing and the singing of both our anthems the way it should be sung was a start of this wonderful upcoming season for our wahine and fans. Yep! It's going to be a wild ride for all of us and I can't wait for the rest of the season to get in their full swing of things. Lot of the top schools and Sequoia Giants went down in upsets across the country. Oh, I mean Big Girl Volleyball teams. I know I shouldn't dwell on this but LYLE learn while in the islands of this great State of ours, you "don't" put down or mess with our wahine,not from the greatest fans on Earth. Watch and learn. Maybe you'll get to learn the game of Volleyball. Momentum was on our side from the first serve of the night and our Warriorettes answered the call to a "T". Kanani, Aneli, Stephanie, Amber, Liz, Brandt, newcomers, Hewitt,Forsythe,and most especially Dani our quarterback, Great Job lady Warriors, you done us proud....Keep up the good work and awesome practices that showed us y'all mean business this year and no matter what, we'll be behind you as the 7th man and carry this magical team throughout this 2009 season.

Trust wants Natatorium preserved - Hawaii News&&&Mufi's City Department of Design and Construction, Collins Lam, continues the pattern and practice advanced by the dishonest Mufi Administration, with his deliberate lie here. One of Mufi's first act as Mayor was to pull the 6 million dollars in funds that were already set aside and available for the restoration of this National Historic Landmark that honors the Veterans who served and died for our Country in WWI. Lam said the "city has not determined what to do with the Natatorium." More bogusness from Mufi. The money was there. The City, under Harris, had determined was to do, and this was to restore, but Mufi and Lam playing us as fools, emboldened by the foolery of the rail road job on us.

Donne Dawson - Hawaii Editorials&&&The film office is very important to facilitate all incoming projects to Hawaii. The State Film office should be put under the HTA, Let some one like Mike Mc, take over, Its time for a change and to clean house. Keep the hardworking Staff and let go Donne, we need someone who can get the job done! Bottom line to all of this anyway is the Tax Incentive! It's embarrassing, the State needs to step it up, and be competitive. 15 to 25% is not enough when you have other States with up to 50% incentive. Where would you go? Donne should have been working with the Gov. to increase the Tax Incentive instead on taking all those trips and wasting our tax payers money. "BOTTOM LINE" is that Money talks and BS Walks. Wake up everyone and tell it like it is. Every time we work on a job they always try to nickle and dime us, May be if the Tax incentive was higher, this would not happen, Ha, wishful thinking. It's time for a change in our industry.&&&7
Reasons for Statehood, As Advanced Over Years - Statehood&&&Russia knows the real answer. US democracy isn't all that it claims. For instance, because US citizens wanted Hawaii, THEIR citizens voted for statehood. No one asked the real people whose country Hawaii belonged to-colonialism and exploitation alive and well in Hawaii. Besides, it is common knowledge that only americans can vote in american run elections-so much for democracy. In fact, the Hawaiians are still waiting to be asked the critical question-Do you want to be a state in the united states of america? Ask us , don't be afraid.&&&1
'Good, loyal citizens' were not to be denied representation - S...&&&I am today resigning my office of US District Judge, and I urge all of my colleagues to do likewise as soon as possible. We must stop living a lie, and suppressing and oppressing the Kanaka oiwi, and other Hawaiian nationals. I am deeply ashamed of my past as a Federal Judge aiding and abetting an unlawful military occupation of Hawaii, and I ask for forgiveness for all of my crimes committed against the Hawaiian State, and Nation, while in office. May God have mercy on my soul!&&&5

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Interesting how some 1/64th part Hawaiian in 2009, can have the audacity to reach way back into history, over more than 166 years, and think their miniscule Hawaiian blood allows them that special gift to read the mind of Kamehameha III and what he meant. Ea means life. That's what Kamehameha III said. He meant what he said. Not what Regina or her under-educated, historical revisionists imagine what Ea means. It means "Life." If Kamehameha III wanted to say "Sovereignty," he would have said that. You see, Regina, that is what words are all about. You use words to communicate ideas about what that word means. Only you folks go around telling everybody that this word means something else, because you want to drag all the rest of us into restoring the corrupt, foreign, european-import concept of a monarchy, aped by the rulers that drove the kingdom into debt and ripped off the common native Hawaiian tenants in and since the mahele of 1848.&&&18

Withholding adjustment came without tax change - Columnists&&&Wow. This census data shows the Nei has way to many state workers for the population. Hmmm what are they all doing? Truth is no one really knows. We have too many state workers on the dole, we need to cut out about 15,000 to get where we need to be. If the Nei was as efficient as Singapore, we could cut the work force in half. Truth is we will never be that good, it is not in our blood, forever to be the little backwards state. HDOT projects take months longer than mainland projects, sitting for days with no real progress. Job security? No, job inefficiency. Our port uses mules and wagons compared to how fast Singapore, Taiwan and Japan can unload or load a ship. Our workers are so far behind they can't even see daylight. Ahhhh, just another day in the little third world of Hawaii Nei.&&&7

Preaching a gospel of cash, and reaping plenty from believers -...&&&God knows where the money is, and he knows how to get the money to you,” preached Gloria Copeland, dressed in a crisp pants ensemble like those worn by CEOs. Another ruse to fleece naive people in coughing up hard earned money to line the pockets of these corrupt greedy so-called "greasers"! How in the world can one expect some god to depend on money in order to spread "his" word through these economic opportunists whose primary function is to spread false hopes and rip you off at the same time? Religion and for that matter any type of "god" concept is mis-leading at the least and down right offensive to one's true Creational being that is FREE of charge and not dependent on some fallacy that god is absolute, which treats women like second class objects of exploitation! These so called "gods" or sons/daughters of heavens that came to Earth where nothing more than other humans of advanced civilizations elevating themselves and creating religions to control other humans. Plainly a stupid, degenerative activity frowned down by other more advanced human races. Therefore, gods are just humans and extremely far from even being considered close to the next of the lowest form of spiritual being in which there are 7 in total! Creational Laws are absolutely FREE of charge and located in your brain, not in some church or written fallacy that belittle man and woman for these human parasites called religion and god! Logical reasoning can only be realized by observational discipline of one's mindset in a natural environment free of external/internal interferences from both others and yourself!&&&46
Ask AP: Lawmaker health benefits, Hawaii monarchy&&&It's painfully clear the Democratic majority wants to cram this down our throats, even though they don't want any part of this so called benefit. Let your representatives know how opposed you are to this and inform them your votes are predicated on their vote for reform. We only have to look at our neighbors in Canada to see how pathetic a government run health care system is. Europe also has a government run system and it speaks volumes for private run health care. The United States has an enviable health care system, although there are problems. The government cannot historically run as efficiently as private industry. Just look at the takeover of airport security. The TSA, thousands standing around, is a bloated, inefficient system that speaks volumes on federal health care. Let everyone know your feelings on this! Once we make the change, there is no going back! You will get inferior health care unless you have the money to provide your own health benefits,&&&1
Hope anew - Sports News&&&Aloha: As a Hawaiian language teacher, I could not be more proud. I recall the chickenskin moments when Anuenue graduated its first class and the ceremony was entirely in Hawaiian. With coaches and teachers like Kealoha Wengler and Laiana Wong (one of my fourth year Hawaiian language professors at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa), the Anuenue team is a winner even before they go onto the field. It reminded me that UH-M star quarterback Colt Brennan learned a few Samoan words and used them on the field. Wouldn't it have been grand if Colt and the Samoans on that team had been able to do it in Hawaiian? Pono kakou e kukakuka i ka `olelo mua o keia pae`aina, i kela me keia wahi.

Health agency to record children's vaccinations - Hawaii News&&&Government health officials are urging people not to panic over estimates of 90,000 people dying from swine flu this fall. "Everything we've seen in the U.S. and everything we've seen around the world suggests we won't see that kind of number if the virus doesn't change," said Dr. Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the swine flu seems quite easy to catch, it so far hasn't been more deadly than the flu strains seen every fall and winter — many people have only mild illness. And close genetic tracking of the new virus as it circled the globe over the last five months so far has shown no sign that it's mutating to become more virulent. So do you really need vaccinations?&&&7

Withholding adjustment came without tax change - Hawaii News&&&"QUESTION: How many state employees are there in Hawaii, from the governor down? How does this number compare with the other 49 states? ANSWER: According to the 2008 state Data Book, compiled by the state Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, Hawaii had 74,300 state workers, 32,200 federal workers and 18,550 county workers. The 2008 population was 1,288,198, according to state figures." Based on thes numbers, the Unions want all of us to have an increase in GET to allow 5.76% of the population to keep their current standard of living.

Governor Cayetano (a demoncrat) had it "right on the money" when he convinced the UNION legislators to repeal this law, however, notice that it was reinstated when Lingle (a republican) won the governors seat. Now I wonder WHY they did that?? The more I pondered that question, the more the answer became clearer. BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR THE UNION, NOT THE PEOPLE. Remember that this next election cycle people!&&&42

You will pay business level taxes. Don't like it, don't run an illegal B&B/vacation rental and think you deserve special privleges.

My only question would be, with a budget of $2.4 BILLION dollars for FY 08-09 for the DOE, one would have thought that some of those high paid administrators would have thought of such a project, or even the rubber-stamp BOE. Watch out UH, if this succeeds, Hamamoto and her bloated staff will surely take credit for it.&&&19

Three of Waianae's touchdownns came against the second defense. I was there, the game was never in doubt. Waianae QB completed barely 50% of his passes while Higgins completed 86% which is the real story here. High school kids just arent that efficient, but higgins has been doing it for ging on 2 years now. Good luck to waianae but the score could have easily been way, way worse.&&&15
Missed opportunities - Statehood&&&"Rising sea levels, already inundating low-lying Pacific islands, could threaten Hawaii by midcentury." Hawaii is a pretty hilly state.

Prep briefs - Hawaii Sports&&&Why all the hype over P. J. Minaya in both newspapers? I'm sure he's a nice kid and I don't mean to disparage him. But the reason he threw eight touchdown passes is because his coach left him in the game against an obviously overmatched opponent. Pac-5 was up by 32 points (over four touchdowns) at halftime and Minaya was still throwing in the second half? Give me a break. How about running the ball a little? How about letting the second and third string QBs have a chance? Running up the score or padding the stats against an inferior opponent shows only a lack of sportsmanship on the part of the coaching staff. Now if Minaya can throw 8 TDs against St. Louis or Punahou then more power to him. But for now all that's been proved is that his coach is a jerk.&&&3

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Ref: Justin Hughey's ltr, "Everyone deserves Medicare." It never ceases the amaze me that our elected officials, both Federal and State, vote for a new prgram and fund it, yet provide no or little funding for oversight. It is estimated that in 2008 there were approximately $18 BILLION dollars in fraudlant claims submitted to both Medicare and Medicaid, yet less than 1/16th was recouped. Imagine how many people could have been treated by Medicare/Medicaid, if there was an investigative arm that could ferret out and criminally charged those doctors and hosptials that submit fraudlant claims. Much like our Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA), a division of the State Department of the Attorney General, who has yet to collect/recover more than $500 MILLION dollars in outstanding child support payments. It is no surprise that Hawaii ranks LAST in the nation in collecting delinquent child support.&&&26
Aiea alumni ascend at UH - Hawaii Sports&&&Thanks for this wonderful story on both Rocky and RJ. I have known them since they were in 'Aiea Intermediate and as a mother of two boys they used to come over my house alot. They are two fine young men and deserve everything they have waited for all of these years! They have supported the athletes @'Aiea 100% and yes I knew when they used to go and lift at Milton's house too. Without more people keeping our young children off the streets and doing positive things like Mr. Kanemoto I would not want to know where this world would be. The 'Aiea community did a thank to Milts last year and it was very successful. The Kaua'i community is now fortunate to have them helping them now. Take care and god bless you guys Rocky and RJ. See you guys at the games.. love Aunty V&&&8

Fiscal Fools&&&Obama's 09 deficit exceeds all eight years of Bush red ink By: Mark Tapscott Editorial Page Editor 08/25/09 3:08 PM EDT How much is President Obama boosting federal spending?  This year, Washington will spend $30,958 per household, tax $17,576 per household, and borrow $13,392 per household. This spending is not just temporary: President Obama would permanently keep annual spending between $5,000 and $8,000 per household higher than it had been under President Bush.  The 22 percent spending increase projected for 2009 represents the largest government expansion since the 1952 height of the Korean War (adjusted for inflation). Federal spending is up 57 percent since 2001.  The 2009 budget deficit will be larger than all budget deficits from 2002 through 2007 combined. More than 43 cents of every dollar Washington spends in 2009 will have been borrowed.  One would expect the post-recession deficit to revert back to the $150 billion to $350 billion budget deficits that were typical before the recession. Instead, by 2019, the President forecasts a $917 billion budget deficit, a public debt of 77 percent of GDP, and annual net interest spending of $774 billion.  The White House projects $10.6 trillion in new deficits between 2009 and 2019nearly $80,000 per household in new borrowing.  None of these estimates include the cost of health reform.  The White House underestimates future budget deficits by trillions of dollars by (1) assuming that discretionary spending will be frozen to inflation for the next decade,(2) assuming that cap-and-trade revenues will be available to finance a Make Work Pay credit (the House-passed bill allocates those revenues elsewhere),(3) assuming health care reform will be deficit-neutral, and (4) assuming certain tax increases that are unlikely to be enacted.&&&1

RGM in the CFL - Hawaii Sports&&&Was a "Shock to his agency"? I'd say, he among a couple of the other UH kids that went out early got bad guidance and input... Was common knowledge among NFL Scouts, and reported by reputable NFL trades like Pro Football Weekly, that Brennan's stock dropped like a rock after the debacle in New Orleans, and his play at the Post Season All Star Game he was in... The only surprise of the bunch, was Bess, not going as a 5-6 round pick... Worked out ok for him thus far, but, certainly took some breaks, that not all free agents get... By the way, I'd suggest Grice-Mullen evaluate one benefit that staying an extra year at UH might have afforded... Being a year closer to a college degree he is going to need when his football career ends in the next 2-4 years- be it CFL, UFL, AAFL, AFL, or even possibly, NFL.&&&3

I called the director listed under that division and he routed me to another person who said it only covers the first 4 years of college! Real stupid, as this new G.I. programs will be paying into UH system, but because of the stupidity of these clowns...I'm going somewhere else to work on my Master's degree and give that money to another school!&&&9

20-year ecological study set on Big Isle - Hawaii News&&&The Kohala centers ALWAYS partners with Yale University, but never has anything useable, defendable or worhtwhile ever come of it.

So who is the investor behind all these so called beneficial studies, what industry giants are bankrolling these one-sided farces? All studies that have appeared, seem to always show only one side of the story (the funding side), and is never equally structured to debate the pros and cons as a true academic study should.&&&2
No. 8 Mililani 16, Moanalua 3 - Hawaii Sports&&&Our coach stinks. He is a tyrant who has control issues. He doesn't let us play more than one sport.

But Coach Martinez has power and integrity issues. Other MoHS coaches are supportive of their players who participate or want to participate in more than 1 sport. But, not Coach Martinez. He needs to be the boss, the Alpha Dog, and the Napolean. It's called small man syndrome.&&&6

There is no feedback on why one was not selected for the show. And subsequent visits to see the works selected make the criteria used for selection even more puzzling.

Akaka Bill would be 'win-win' - Guest Editorials&&&The anti-statehood protest last Friday shows a very good reason why the Akaka bill must be defeated. See webpage: "Hawaii golden jubilee (50th anniversary of statehood) included ripping the 50th star off the U.S. flag and burning it. Congress must not pass the Akaka bill because it would empower anti-American secessionists." Jon Van Dyke's article repeats the same tired old lies about Hawaiian history that OHA and UH have been bombarding us with for decades. Don't believe them. Here's the antidote: "Hawaii Statehood -- straightening out the history-twisters. A historical narrative defending the legitimacy of the revolution of 1893, the annexation of 1898, and the statehood vote of 1959." Van Dyke's book about the Crown Lands is filled with nonsense. An attorney has written a valuable rebuttal to it: Paul M. Sullivan, "A Very Durable Myth: A Critical Commentary on Jon Van Dyke's 'Who Owns the Crown Lands of Hawaii?'(University of Hawai'i Law Review, Vol. 31, No. 2, Fall 2008, pp. 341-368). For some unknown reason, that edition of the Law Review has never been made available on the internet (other editions have been). So here's a pdf file of Mr. Sullivan's devastating critique of Mr. Van Dyke's book.&&&5

2 Honolulu cops arrested on drug charges in Vegas&&&This is a bad question to ask, I know, but it's something I've always wondered. If you have a reasonably small amount of drugs in your possession, and you decide to make a run for it in your car, as these guys did - isn't it possible to toss the drugs out the window - say on a turn, when it's hard for the pursuing officer to see that side of the car? Powdered stuff would be real easy, of course. Or say it's buds - couldn't the passenger start grinding it up in his hand as they drive along, into little pieces, most of which will never get recovered as evidence? Sure, they could bust you for any residue, but that's still probably better than getting caught with XX grams, isn't it?? I know it's hard to think logically as you're being chased by cops, but seems to me that at that point you're obviously f*cked up, so you might as well try get rid of most of the evidence (which I know, is also a crime in itself). As far as these guys go - dang, threw their lives down the drain just for the sake of partying a couple nights. Wow, bad move.&&&13

Stamp to salute Hawaii statehood - Hawaii News&&&-Mr. Kane done a marvelous job in this stamp design, there is however one major design flaw, how can the Sovereignty of Hawai'i be sold for 44c? The more intellectually astute will acknowledge there is no cause for celebration in so called "statehood." [See: for details]. The stamp should rightfully have either "Nation of Hawai'i" or "Hawaiian Nation" incorporated. Awhile back Mr. Potter the U.S. Post Master General had a glitzy social photo promotion of the stamp displayed. He has an appropriate name as he himself displays all the wizardry of Harry Potter. Would it cause a "stampede" if the call went out to "stamp out philately" in this particular instance?[Haw-Haw].&&&54

Stop being a lemming and get the facts, The president's plan is NOT about care (well it will be if adopted, as in less quality care due primarily to vastly reduced payments)and is about insurance. Do you honestly want the same folks who can't even manage a 3 billion dollar cash for clunkers program correctly running a trillion dollar health care plan?

Events celebrate statehood - Hawaii News&&&Before anybody believes the lies that will be told during the "Mai Poina" walking tour: Here's a new webpage whose purpose is well-described by its title: Hawaii Statehood -- straightening out the history-twisters. A historical narrative defending the legitimacy of the revolution of 1893, the annexation of 1898, and the statehood vote of 1959. The question before us is: shall we rip half the 50th star off the flag (Akaka bill to create a race-based government), or shall we rip off the entire 50th star (secession)? I say we keep the whole star firmly on the flag, and celebrate the fact it is there.

Homeless vets' aid vowed - Hawaii News&&&For decades our government has done a very good job of saving taxpayers’ money with inadequate Veterans Affairs funding. President Obama recently made excellent leadership appointments to Veterans Affairs. Even with their proven leadership abilities, and impeccable credentials, both Secretary Eric Shinseki and Deputy Secretary W. Scott Gould are facing the cumulative inadequacies of decades past. The tiny fuse of overmedication that has kept this whole VA system operational for 30-some years now desperately needs to be replaced with major re-wiring. This young generation of veterans should not have to experience the palliative treatment of health care most veterans using the VA have experienced for decades. It would be great to see the VA step into the 21st century as the leader in world-class health care. But after decades of under-funding, this proposed new VA budget is not enough. For our new leadership to achieve its full potential along with world-class VA health care, a one-time, additional funding of $20 billion for a ‘21st century investment in VA healthcare’ is desperately needed. The VA has many good doctors working there who will feel much relief to actually have the opportunity to treat their patients instead of just medicating their symptoms.&&&13

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Michael J. Golojuch Jr.- great, the stations are nice but what about PARKING by them? If the train is only going to carry folks who walk to the station it will be a miserable EXPENSIVE failure. If parking is EXPENSIVE and limited, the train will fail. In fact, given the cost to build it then the cost to run it, it will fail. I guess when they finally figure that out and tear it down they can use all the concrete to make an artificial reef somewhere.&&&235

Who's behind the Yellow Pages? - Kokua Line&&&Hawaiian Telcom remains the most dysfunctional and amateur company with which I've ever done business. There is absolutely no area where they are even barely adequate. There tech support is neither trained nor available. Customer service is the same. When I switched to Oceanic/Time Warner I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven! I suggest that a new organization with some experience buy this all-time loser. It would take almost nothing to make it 100% better.&&&2

Inouye proudly declares he's No. 1 in setting earmarks - Hawaii...&&&What a wonderful title...instead of earmarks how about "King of pork". Can anyone say 1.5 TRILLION dollar deficit and STILL say Daniel should keep his job? I know, the welfare mentality voters of the state will think this is the best thing since sliced bread and keep re electing him....just remember what Margaret Thatcher said: "Socialism works until you run out of other people's money to spend" All those earmarks come with a price and contrary to what some believe, money does NOT grow on trees.&&&26

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Regarding, "Falsehoods Need Rebuttal" by Stephen Burns, Mililani. ----- Mr. Burns, your letter is full of what we in the islands call "shibai!" Just based on the context of your letter, one could conclude that Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh must be the only outlets of news and information. "Back in the old days," as you termed them, there was no Internet and the televison/radio media was much more regionalized with fewer choices. Today, however, with 24-hr television and radio, countless Internet web sites, and a plethora of newspapers and magazines, there is no shortage of available news and information across the entire spectrum of opinion in the health care reform debate, as well as in just about any other subject or issue. What you really want to do, sir, is put weighted shackles on the opinions that differ from your own. Besides, what if such a doctrine was implemented, and after you were finished watching Keith Olbermann on MS-NBC, Rush Limbaugh came on the screen and began running his viewpoints. Will you be mandated by the government to watch and listen to Rush just as you did Olbermann? Or, will you have the freedom to change the channel or turn off the TV? If I'm listening to Sean Hannity and want to get a differing opinion, I can turn the channel over the MS-NBC or find it elsewhere with relative ease. **THERE** is your fairness doctrine!&&&37

Aug. 23, 1952 - Hawaii Business&&&Right on, Star-Bulletin. I gotta remember for check this "Back in the Day" article on SUNDAY. I like the term the captain used, "amplify." That's a righteous word to use as a synonym for alot of stuff. And, he uses the term well before the Marshall Amplifiers helped propel the loud, hippy music of the 60's, before Dylan went electric, but went full blast by the time Woodstock rolled around soon thereafter, all of which is woven now into the fabric of American history. Yeah. Amplify.&&&1
Pilares enjoys hitting the weights - Hawaii Sports&&&Pilares is their best player.

I pity South Arkansas. Go Warriors!&&&4
Kahuku sacks Punahou - Sports News&&&Punahou is bubble gum. The refs made it a very close game. I would like to see the film to see how many were actually penalties. The refs also seemed to miss a lot of penalties by the the ILH team. Maybe Obama had a wager in on it or something. Anyways, Punahou lost their Kahuku transplants to graduation and cannot hang with us anymore. Good luck against Kamehameha and St. Louis, you will need it. Go RED RAIDERS!!!!!!!!!!&&&2

TV stations' deal raises concerns - Hawaii Editorials&&&Ultimately, commercial television needs advertising revenue to exist and provide content many viewers take for granted. Fact of the matter, is that the television advertising revenue in Hawaii, has stayed pretty much consistant with what it was in the late 80's, while expenses and related costs have continued to rise. The reality of the matter, is Hawaii for its market size, has had more television than the market can support, and the next step in this process, could not only be the loss or consolidation if you will of news operations, but a station going off the air in total...&&&9

Taking our worries to the next level - Columnists&&&The surprising thing about the heatpackers who feel obliged to flaunt their right to open-carry weapons wherever they please is that it has taken so long for these loonies to surface. We live in a culture that is saturated with gun culture, gun violence, gun fetishism. The greatest share of our national budget is lavished on the military ... so much so that our "defense" expenditures exceed those of most of the rest of the world's COMBINED. Films, TV shows, music videos, video games endlessly extoll guns and gun violence with first-pointer shooter games dominating what many consider entertainment. The loony gunpackers will tell you that a totally armed society would be a perfectly polite society, but they do not mention that fear of being shot is hardly a motivator for feeling free to express yourself. A society totally saturated with guns will become a society in which guns appear everywhere. Hang on; this is just the beginning.&&&1

Obama is doing the best the keep the people working, Gov Lingle is trying to lower the deficit, private companies are reducing from 40hrs to 32hrs weekly paid for the workers. $38K is a lot better than $18K that I get.

'Bumping' plans under way - Hawaii News&&&The article reports that a state nurse for 26 years said, "The state wants to leave all that burden on us." 62 Hawaii companies had mass layoffs during the first have of this year, and over 100 Hawaii companies had mass layoffs last year. In addition, an even greater number of companies both years have had smaller layoffs and furloughs. Unemployment in the private sector has climbed to a 30-year high. The neighbor islands have been especially hard hit. Unemployment on the Big Island now stands at over 11%, i.e., one in every nine adults is out of work. In other words, Hawaii's private sector has been experiencing 100% of the brunt of the recession. State government workers have been unscathed. Until now. State workers should be telling their shitt-for-brains union leaders to go back to the governor and say, "On second thought, the 3-day furlough each month doesn't sound like such a bad idea after all. It's much better than layoffs."&&&62
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Ref: Ellen Lund's ltr, "Time to raise taxes?" Ellen, those very people that you speak of on the verge of being homeless, with the recent increases in taxes and fee's imposed by both State and C&C budgets, are at the edge of the abyss. Further increases in taxes and fee's will only make their situation worse, to the point of homelessness. I'm still surprised and shocked that the taxpaying citizens aren't demanding of their elected representatives that the bloated government, including waste, mismanagement, theft and even fraud be investigated and thoroughly cleansed. Items like, why hasn't the Child Support Enforcement Agency, a division of the Department of the Attorney General has yet to recover more than $500 MILLION in outstanding child support payment? Why is the State Contemporary Museum receiving $93,000 a year for the Artmobile when the last time it was "on the road was 2002? Why is the State spending $1.5 MILLION to restore the glass mosaic in the main floor of the Capital? Examples of waste of taxpayer dollars.$250,000 dollars to Rick Mills for a glass wall sculpture at the Maui Memorial Medical Center.$220,000 dollars to James Carpenter for a steel and glass sculpture at the UH School of Architecture.$130,000 dollars to Robert Flink for his artwork of ceramic tiles adorning THREE (3) water coolers at the Hawaii Convention Center. The recent salary and expense raises to our legislators will be an additional $1.17 MILLION dollars that the taxpayers will have to shoulder. No Ellen, we don't need any increases in taxes or fee's. We need to hold our government, both State and C&C more accountable as to how our money is spent.&&&22
Complex health care issue deserves closer scrutiny - Hawaii Edi...&&&Excellent letter. As you pointed out, how on earth do you have cuts and expect the same level of service? Medicare/medicaid are both already broke and getting worse. More and more providers opt out of seeing patients with either due to the huge paperwork demand and payments that do not cover costs.&&&23
The Sack Man scareth - Centurions&&&yeah Al was good enough to make 1st team AA, but he still was an arrogant self-absorbed conceited aszhole who loved only himself, and the anecdotes in the article highlight that fact. Most of the Samoans on campus hated him, and NONE of the Samoan girls would ever date him, not even that one fat pigeon-toed girl who ignored him when he used to throw rocks at her window at Hale Kahawai. LAUGH! He had to go outside his race and even outside the state to find a girl, and then, in true family form, he beat on Kathi Wolfgramm the way his brothers beat on their women. so sad. He made the NFL but he certainly never made the Pro Bowl and did not last long in the NFL strictly because he and his ego would never and could never grasp the "there is no I in team" concept. He did his own thing on the field because he was so egocentric to take orders from someone else. In the end, his fate was sealed because he loved only himself and no one else, which meant that eventually everyone else stopped giving a care about him, period.&&&11

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&This is in reply to Sari Bouret comment on National health Care. When the Government gives you something, it is never free. We the taxpayers are paying for it. Government is not a profit maker but a taker.

They could hardly have enough to pay their employees. Stop begging for money from American Samoa and ask someone else like Obama and he might give you a dime.&&&25
Enterprise to rent hybrid cars in isles - Hawaii Business&&&It would have been nice if the article had said how much more it would cost to rent a hybrid than a standard compact, and how many cars would be available. Checking the Enterprise website for late September, it indicated a Prius could be rented for $37.99 per day, compared to $30.39 per day for a compact. So, not terribly much more. All in all, not a bad deal. Good for Enterprise.&&&5

Female inmates to return to isles - Hawaii News&&&"Being raped is not part of their sentence. They're women with children who made bad choices," said Dias, who added that guards have retaliated against her niece for the report. "Why is she still there if she was substantiated?" Dias said. "She should've been the first to come home." Most of you don't agree with me here, but however this is common knowledge. My point exactly! Victimized women don't want to make waves so many of them never report these things. Some one better get this lady home ASAP.&&&38
Governors resist Reserve plan - Hawaii News&&&Support Governor Lingle. Governors run the national guard. Thats the militia identified in the US Constitution (each state shall have one). US Army does not need to patrol our streets or do routine police duties. US Armies mission is to kill the enemy. Police Departments mission is to serve and protect the citizen. As much as we love and honor our national soldiers; we don't want the US Army on our streets or in our homes. Kig George understood that...after a bloody war. Leave the civilian law enforcement duties to civilians.&&&9

I hope that President Obama realizes that he has been in office long enough to know that he now owns the problem.&&&5

Isle hotel revenue, occupancy decline - Hawaii Business&&&Are you surprised about the decline? Instead of rallying together and coming up with some plans to increase visitors coming here, we raise the taxes so it's passed on to our visitors. Customer service went out the window at our hotels and the "aloha" spirit is a term we use but can't deliver. Now we have to layoff even more workers in the public sector and cut even more programs. Oh well, we are in for some rough times gang and it will be interesting to see how this all pans out with the layoffs and service cuts. They have to be done but maybe if our elected officials came up with other ideas instead of just raising taxes, we wouldn't be as bad as we are.&&&7
Mass movement - Hawaii News&&&aaah nice to have all the positive news. New student, potential alumni and donors for UH, new dreams and hope, all the excitement and great talks by highly paid administrators who do not even teach 1 class period, etc. Then in less than 2 months, reality will set in...BANG...budget cuts, lecturers and faculty will be given notice of termination...time to pack your bags and go. Meanwhile big time administrators will enjoy their fat salaries of $200-400k. They are leading by example, 7% cut and looking to take it out of the faculty and staff at 14% or 500+ positions gone. Wipe out...big wave!&&&12

How about face the truth, the city can not maintain what it has and YOU want to add more to it? I hope you have really deep pockets because this boondoggle is going to cost everyone a bunch....to build, subsidize and maintain.&&&2

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Nick Nagel is right on. Mufi only "talk" about "Green" this and "Green" that. But the rail road job on us tax-payers should also have contemplated real alternative transportation modes, including, of course, biking, in the "Green" marketing ploy. Otherwise, the only "Green" Mufi was really talking about, was maybe the "Green" going into his wallet under the table, or into his campaign fund, and into the pockets of the union working stiff bosses.&&&18
Police / Fire - Hawaii News&&&It seems that there's more to the story of the 14 year old boy. He may have been provoked or he may have been mistreated. I hope the police and whomever investigates will find out the true reason for this teenager's anger. Our teens in Hawaii need more help than ever so, let's not jump to conclusions until we find out what led up to the boy hitting the adult with a tree branch and threatening to kill him. The 25 year old male should be punished if he tried to harm the boy. Please listen to both sides of this story before you make your judgement. I used to be told that children should be seen and not heard but, that's not the right thing to do. Children should be vocal but, diplomatically. We, as adults, should teach our Keiki how to be compassionate, caring, helpful, kind, etc. Also, we need to teach our Keiki to be aware of their surroundings because, one day, they may be a victim of someone with bad intentions. I know, believe me, I know.&&&5

Layoffs end kids' dental aid - Hawaii News&&&Fluoride in water is a big mistake.Dental fluorosis is only cause by fluoride. Dentists make higher profits in fluoridated areas and through fluoride use. As a result of mottled enamel, many more restorative measures are necessary, such as braces, bridges, etc. For the American and Canadian Dental Associations, this condition is a real money-maker, because cosmetic dentistry is far more lucrative than cavity repair. In addition, there is an abundance of evidence in the scientific literature indicating that fluoride causes a delay in the normal shedding of the "baby" teeth, and their replacement by permanent teeth. This delay has been shown to increase the number of children with malpositioned teeth. Again, braces are far more expensive than fillings.(Note: In a 1972 report by the American Dental Association, it is stated that dentists make 17% more profit in fluoridated areas as opposed to non-fluoridated areas.)(Douglas et al., "Impact of water fluoridation on dental practices and dental manpower", Journal of the American Dental Association; 84:355-67, 1972) In 1993 the National Academy of Sciences warned, "dental fluorosis...might be more than a cosmetic defect if enough fluorotic enamel is fractured and lost to cause pain, adversely affect food choices, compromise chewing efficiency, and require complex dental treatment."According to the American Dental Association: "Fluoride works primarily via topical mechanisms to inhibit demineralization, to enhance remineralization, and to inhibit bacteria associated with tooth decay." (It enhances remineralization does it?...Well bang goes that claim.) A statement suggesting the exact opposite of the above claim that fluoride works "to enhance remineralization," can be found on Chapter 3, Page 54 of the Surgeon General's 2004 study on bone problems in the United States,(Table 3-3, American Society for Bone and Mineral Research). We find here, in the Surgeon General's study, that fluoride has been placed into a well-deserved category reserved for substances that are known to cause "Direct impairment of mineralization." More importantly, however, is the statement that fluoride works "primarily via topical mechanisms." "Topical," means applying something to the surface. If this is the mechanism by which fluoride primarily works, then where is the prudence, the sound judgment, the practical intelligence of putting this HAZMAT toxic waste into our drinking water under the false and tired claim that it is good for us - and telling us that it is good for our children? see&&&32
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Mix bike paths with rail system corridor" Good idea Nick! Add even MORE cost to this white elepahant. Let me see, besides the actual path you would need a barrier of some sort the entire length of the rail line to prevent folks from falling off the elevated line. You would ALSO need a barrier to keep them from going in front of a train. Hey I know, as long as you are adding a bike path why not a couple of car lanes!!!!!!! Actually the BEST plan is don't build it at all.&&&37

Statehood gallery - Hawaii News&&&Aloha! Congratulations on achieving 50 years of statehood. You can't know how proud we, on the Mainland, are that you are among us. I was in the 6th grade when Hawai'i became a state. We held a lu'au for everyone in school. A group of girls learned to dance the hula from mothers who had been in Hawai'i during the war. They performed for us. We had kalua pork and pineapple for lunch. Well, it wasn't REALLY kahlua pork, but it was barbecued pork. The pineapple came out of a can. Does that count? On the Mainland in 1959, it was all we could get, of course. Hawaiian melodies were played over the school's sound system. For one, brief, shining day, we enjoyed the spirit of aloha. All best wishes for a happy and peaceful Statehood Day tomorrow.&&&1

Fortunately, with the new school calendar they will have a better chance to do so.&&&20

Proposal would benefit laid-off state workers on verge of retir...&&&Gee ... only 300 state workers retired in June? Less than I expected. If the State Employees Retirement System estimates there could be as many as 2,250 state workers retiring Dec. 31, well above the usual 500 to 600, I doubt that the number of retirees will be close to 2,250 if the usual number is about 500 to 600. What incentive is there to retire on December 31st? The retirees have already missed the June 1st cutoff date to avoid losing their retiree medical benefits should the State legislature pass the legislation that will take away any retiree's health insurance benefits until they reach Medicare age. The more cautious State workers retired on June 1st to meet the deadline of July 1, 2009 as set forth in Calvin Say's house bill. So it's very likely that the majority of the December 31st retirees are just doing it because it is at the end of the year and they are 62 years of age and can collect their Social Security benefits. Some retirees may decide to retire because they are paying more for their health benefits and may be thinking that they may suffer a pay cut on top of that. It's not a big enough issue to cause 2,250 to retire on December 31st.&&&66

Former home lands head broke barriers - Hawaii News&&&The article only briefly mentions that she was a police officer but omits to mention that she was a police matron, who used that background to engineer, orchestrate and execute a plan that flew in teams of SWAT, Police and Sheriff Deputies to Keaukaha to intimidate, arrest and evict native Hawaiian homesteaders protesting the unlawful imposition of water fees (specifically and textually prohibited by the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920) by the County of Hawaii. Placing the interest of the County of Hawaii collecting water fees, above the beneficiaries, in apparent reward to the County for misuse of Hawaiian Home Lands allowed by the State, and which misuse historically included the sewer plant (that served everyone in Hilo, except the native Hawaiians of Keaukaha and) closed by the EPA at Puhi Bay. Her police-state tactics of intimidating the native Hawaiians, also included razing and bulldozing the community effort to re-establish the former beach side "Hawaiian Village" project, that her leadership at DHHL left abandoned to decay into a hard-top, empty, parking lot. Perhaps her crowning achievement is giving birth to Henry Peters, the now dishonored former Trustee of the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, and his ouster from such position in the wake of corruption that led to his and those other former Trustees being removed following threat by the IRS to strip KSBE's tax-exempt status if they did not resign.

I can understand how she feels..we probably would feel the same way if the bus stop was taken bye homeless and the people wanting to use the bus had no place to wait. We love Honolulu and feel for the good of the people, government should send the homeless back to where they came from. You know, at one time, probably all of us mainlanders have thought, Hawaii is warm so lets go and live there, on the beach, elsewhere.,etc. I have mentioned before, on Molokai at the eastern part by the ocean, we met a young couple living their dream fishing for their lunch. We talked for quite a while. They had a lean too built by the mountain and fished every day. I envey them and often wonder if they are still there.&&&11

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Jim Doyle - you like the French solution so much move there and leave our system alone, it WORKS for over 85% of the population. If you want to bone up on long waits, do some research into the MA mandatory insurance plan. The average wait in the USA to see a specialist is 10 days...in MA it is 54, highest by far of all states. That is NOT Republican spin, it is a fact. By the by, the USA has GREAT care and EVERYONE can get it even those without insurance and not even a citizen. Watch as it goes in the toilet when Uncle Sam takes over and dictates what will be paid for what...the brightest and best doctors will NOT accept the government insurance, they don't want to lose money every time the see a patient or do a proceedure.&&&36

A case for modernization - Guest Editorials&&&This Article is a classic example of a Westerner judging Japan through the lens of Western Culture. For example, Japan's "constitutional premise of equality" is written in a constitution enforced by the American military in the wake of World War II. There's any number of sections in their constitution which the Japanese as a group clearly ignore (the most obvious being their Self Defense Force, specifically outlawed in the constitution). And the urge to "secularize" the Emperor. Any true survey of Japan would show Japan's religion's are often much more form and tradition over true belief and religion. To secularize the Emperor, would mean removing pomp and tradition from the emperor, reducing the Emperor to nothing more than a common man. Emperor Hirohito already reduced heavily the "divine aura of the Emperor, remember how he so carefully would only be photographed on a horse, higher than his subjects. The Emperor is a peculiarly Japanese tradition, no matter how many other countries and regions have Kings and regents, the Japanese Emperor is purportedly the only unbroken chain for hundreds of years. Even as others actually ruled the country, the vast respect for the Emperor, and the office and tradition of the Emperor, kept the Emperor and his offspring alive and well. The latest Richard Chamberlain who knows better than the locals, gives advice that would destroy the tradition, not save it.&&&1

Born identity - Kokua Line&&&As a Jewess in the US, I ask WHAT is Hussein Obama HIDING? Doesnât matter! TOO LATE NOW! There are now some constitutional/legislative atheologiansâ who say that even IF the DemocRAT votes COULD be found to impeach him, that Obama is legally UNIMPEACHABLE, if in fact he is not a natural-born American. They say that, because then he would never have been eligible to hold the office in the first place, and so is NOT the President, and thus CANNOT be impeached! The articles simply would NOT APPLY to him, any more than they would to you or me. Meanwhile, he occupies the White House, sitting around smoking cigars, drinking Crown Royal, and flitting about on Air Force One. If true, HOW would he be removed from the White House? Perhaps via an ordinary EVICTION process? Donât let the media bury this story! -Wendy Weinbaum&&&4

Letters to the editor - Letters&&&State workers tired of being picked on By Susan Yamane Honolulu State workers are not being picked on. Labor is the most expensive of all state expenditures which makes it the likely target for reduction. Raising taxes will not stop the loss of money to the state. The economy is in trouble. Higher unemployment, less spending by the public, less tourist arrivals mean less money to spend by the state. Cuts must be made the same way you must cut your household budget if less income comes in. No one wants to see states workers lose pay because this just hurts the economy more. The problem is, raising taxes will also hurt the economy. The states needs to cut programs and services which will mean a loss of jobs also.&&&54

The difference between spending the money on a sub and spending it on the hungry and poor is, we ALREADY spend a bunch on the poor and when you buy a sub you only buy it ONCE..the poor are there forever as long as YOU keep handing them EVERYTHING and never expect them to better themselves.

TV special traces hospital's 150 years - Hawaii News&&&When I took my grandmother to Queen's Hospital they treated her worse than dirt.

In my personal experience if they treated my grandmother THIS way I can ONLY imagine how they treat other Hawaiians. Staining the memory of Queen Emma and her wishes. Aue!&&&4
Navy to target drone - Hawaii News&&&War without end. Make no mistake about this ... what we are witnessing vis a vis these tests is the militarization of near space. It is ironic that the US was one of the pioneers and the most prolific producer of the very missiles that we are now insisting that billions must be spent to countervail. Of course it is only a relatively short time that will pass before other nations develop their own anti-missile missiles or, more likely, produce missile strike strategies that can simply overwhelm our anti-missile defense systems. The tests we witness never include defenses against "swarming' missile strikes, or against a strike or strikes that deploy decoys (either physical or electronic. Just as nuclear proliferation produced a far less secure world in that tens of thousands of nukes remain in active arsenals and nations are scrambling to join the club, the militarization of near space will soon come to be considered a tragic error. We will rue the days that we applauded these developments and missed another opportunity to commit ourselves to world peace.&&&2

In one block, which had 3 light poles, there will now be 5, and that's on both side of the street. Now they will say, it was already budgeted. That still doesn't mean that it couldn't be put on hold until the economy improves. Maybe they're going to use Lunalilo Home Road as a reference point for the space station.

Police / Fire - Newswatch&&&"70-year-old charged after sex assault on 12-year-old." "Man facing many counts of sex assault on a minor, a 13 year old girl." Our Department of Corrections should place the two in the general population at the prison and make sure the inmates are aware of their crime. Remind the inmates that the 12 year old boy could have been their son or that the 13 year old girl could have been their daughter. I'm sure if the courts don't punish them enough, the inmates will.&&&2

Union Mafia Robbery&&&HGEA boss makes more than Governor In truth, Randy Perreira makes over $150,000 a year on dues from union members! Randy knows he clears at least $25,000 a year more than the Governor, herself, who is taking a voluntary pay cut and furlough. In typical, arrogant, Union Boss fashion, Perreira fails to mention that he isn't taking any pay cut, himself, nor is he offering to reduce the monthly dues for the hard-working rank and file to ease the hardship. With these greedy bosses, it's always, "Do as I say, not as I do!"&&&1
Letters to the editor - Letters&&&(Note to my fan club: Some lunatic is canvassing this blog and impersonating me, as well as others. Besides the obvious fact he's mental, vapid, and emasculated, be forewarned.) Anyway, that said, I think faster moving cars save energy, not the stop-n-go in traffic kind.

Flanagan ends Marr's Tinman streak - Sports News&&&Wow, it's impressive how well John does considering he just recently began competing in triathlons. It is even more impressive, considering he works full-time, helps take care of his two young children, and still trains. Imagine what he could do if he had sponsors that other pros like Tim Marr have that pay a stipend enabling them more free time to train. I saw John compete in the Chun's to Waimea swim the day before the Tin Man and later playing in the water with his family. I was surprised to know he was doing the Tin Man the next day. I would probably have been home resting. As a beginner in the racing community, I am inspired by people like John. He has always been very humble and supportive when I've had the chance to talk to him.&&&2

Kokua Line: Subway ads fail to say not sold&&&Are dealership mechanics trained to be deaf when they hear the word 'warranty'? I took a test drive with someone (I don't know what his title was) so that he could hear the noises I was describing as being the problem. After hearing the noises he said he would have to go on a test drive with the technician so he could describe the problem. Well after an hour later I got 'the call'. They can't duplicate the sounds so their recommendation? Leave it alone and see what happens (for the rattling sound I hear when I accelerate)and a tire rotation & wheel alignment for the vibration I feel (of course not covered under warranty) for $250. This is not the first time something like this has happened to me so I wasn't that surprised. I guess more disappointed. Hey, maybe Mufi can use this as a selling point for the rail!!&&&11

Scientists 'feed' CO2 to algae&&&This is disturbing. It seems that since the organisms will sink to greater debts and take the CO2 with it, that this is a way that CO2 might eventually be released at greater depths. It's probably not so, if they have studied the process for so many years. Don't all things decay and release the CO2-- at least at the surface?&&&14
Police / Fire - Hawaii News&&&Something is fishy about the Hilo home invasion story. It's not that easy to knock someone unconscious - and to then be prepared to tie the person up with duct tape is evidence of a very poor planner, or a very silly conspirator. This is a scenario straight out of some B-Movie where the guy gets a friend or pays some patsy to put a bump on his head (assuming there even was one) and then duct tapes the guy, etc. Who then notifies his insurance company of the losses, etc Or otherwise has a needed excuse for what he really did with the money.&&&1

Letters to the editor - Letters&&&Terry Ann Yamamoto's letter that essentially tries to place our collective heads in the sand, reflects a wishful thinking of no rail lawsuits in fantasy land. First of all, there are conflicting figures. One set tells us the rail project will cost more than what Hanneman has tried to sell us. But Hanneman's figures tells us it will cost us less. Either way, it is money neither us Honolulu tax-payers nor the American public tax-payers, have. But, I doubt any lawsuit could arise from the mere budget outlay. More likely such lawsuits would arise probably along the lines of failure to comply with the EIS process, the favoritism and cronyism that has come to mark Mufi's reign of economic terror, or otherwise a lack of transparency in the awarding of non-bid contracts, or any number of issues any group---from the tree huggers to the Mufi haters---can come up with. Some folks fail to make the connection between Mufi plundering 900 million so far of our city tax revenue for this juggernaut, and that link to the raising of our taxes. Like Terri Ann.&&&30

Two-room school in Congo takes the name of UH scholar Paige - H...&&&Aloha friends of Dr. Glenn Paige ... and those who favor peace on earth: Great story. Wonderful honor. Every time I hear about Mahatma Ghandi, Mother Teresa, Father Damien, The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks or Jimmy Carter ... I think about Glenn Paige. When I hear or read about violence anywhere in the world ... I think of Glenn Paige. I also think about Dr. Paige ... -- every time I think about Hubert Humphrey, Cordell Hull, Dag Hammarskjold, Linus Pauling, Ah Quon McElrath, Woodrow Wilson, or Eleanor Roosevelt. -- when I'm invited to perform at anti-war, pro-peace, or non-violence rallies, or when I sing songs of Pete Seeger, or listen to words of John Lennon, or when I sing my "Cease Fire" or "Song of Peace," one of Professor Paige's favorites. -- when I hear or read about efforts to bring about peace in our world or to correct inequities, social ills, violations of civil rights, or killing. -- when I think about Darfur, The Congo, East Timor, Tibet, Iraq. Among my personal idols, my heroes, are some of the greatest men and women in the world. They believed in and fought for peace, human and civil rights, and yes, global non-violence. And every time I hear their names, or even think or read about them and what they stood or still stand for ... I think about Dr. Glenn Paige of Honolulu, one of my heroes. Every time I sing "Cease Fire" or "Song of Peace" or "Simple Song of Freedom," I think of you, Dr. Paige. FYI, Dr. Glenn Paige, professor emeritus, author, founder of the Honolulu-based Center for Global NonViolence, also just celebrated his 80th birthday, and he continues to work for all of us in a lifelong quest for non-violence and for peace on earth. He is a veteran who wants to end killing. Thank you, Dr. Paige. We should all be so dedicated. Happy Birthday, Dr. Paige, and congratulations. Carmen & Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&4
Hawaii foreign enough for anti-Obama brigade - Columnists&&&I don't believe ANY Hawaii state official has said they have seen the HAWAII birth cerificate for Obama.

It's important for any non-profit to focus on its mission, but it's just as important to be a good community neighbor. That's why registered non-profits receive special tax considerations. Outdoor Circle is making it very clear that it is not.&&&1

Expert tips - Hawaii Features&&&Wow ... this seems to be a whole lot of hassle over, what, a measly 50 cents. It's like the recent debates over the current minimum wage and expected increases. How about being more relaxed and generous towards the people who are working their tails off while we sit and quibble over dimes? Restaurant help is habitually stiffed and they have to endure impatient, cranky, and downright rude diners. The last thing one should do is be stingy with the tip.&&&22

But talking on a phone? I was a truck driver for over 10 years before coming to Hawaii, talking on a CB Radio for hours with a handheld mic in my hand. Never heard of an accident caused by someone talking on a CB radio. C'mon people, use some common sense and pay some attention to your driving, use your turn signals.&&&2

Even though, 2 people get together for lunch or dinner, and the only reason they are together is business related, he cannot stop himself from taxing SOMETHING for goodness sake. Plus, this is pure showmanship, something to say he did before he continues to suck more money from the public trough as he hopes to be governor. Yeah, big whoop Mr "Business", stay in Washington, you do less harm there.&&&24

Stadium Park perked up by clearing of tents, carts - Hawaii News&&&The unfortunate facts are there will always be homeless no matter where you go. However, Hawaii is a island and like a lifeboat it can only hold so many. If you are of hawaiian descent then I feel that should be hawaii's problem but if you are from another state or country imposing your welfare on hawaii and its' peolpe is not right. If you hold a job but can't afford a home at least your contributing something and trying, but if your just there it's puts an undo burden on everyone else. If this is the case then sending you back to where you came from is not only fair but a matter of survival for hawaii.&&&55

Oil tax debate overrides debut of Clean Energy Day - Hawaii News&&&Jeff Mikulina said "We are totally at the mercy of imported oil." Why do eco's use the claim but when people want to drill for oil off the east coast and California coast they fight to stop it. Just say to clean the air we need wind and solar power. It will cost an arm and a leg but the earth will thank you for it.&&&67
Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Walter, you think this is going to "breaking America's families" now? Just wait until this gov't-run (dictated) program, if passed, breaks America altogether! Read the CBO report and educate yourself on the actual stats of uninsured (actually 18%...not 46%-that is the annual total, but includes people who may have been out of job for a couple of months but were employed later OR could pay for their medical care if needed), half of uninsured qualify for medicaid but do not sign up...just read the report. I mean our elected representatives clearly do not read legislation, but let's not be dolts like them and play politics with something that took years to develop, but now days to read the 1000+ pages and pass without knowing what's really in there.&&&67

Fourth isle death from swine flu recorded - Hawaii News&&&According to the Washington Post, a rapid test for Type A flu exists and is being used by doctors on the East Coast. Since Swine Flu is a Type A flu, why don't doctors and hospitals simply use this test? At least you would know if you had the flu and should take Tamiflu or Relenza. These anti-virals reduce severity of the disease and the length of time it takes to run its course. In the case of those with underlying symptoms, like asthma, it could mean the difference between life and death they take an anti-viral. Why doesn't the state encourage better diagnosis?&&&7

State House budget calls for 374 layoffs - Hawaii News&&&It is important to give Rep. Oshiro credit for presenting a realistic picture of what has to happen to make reductions that are more than band-aid in nature. The situation is more than a one-year problem, so remedies have to impact budget "out years" in an effective way. The House budget tries to do that.&&&8

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Take furloughs over job loss" Are you nuts Toshio? Everyone knows it would be BEST to raise taxes because we HAVE to preserve the unions...in fact we NEED to grow them and make them even bigger and stronger. There is still a lot of loose money out there the state has not confiscated yet, get cracking and take all you can before it is too late. Truth is, the unions do not want to give up anything...and never will, why should they, they OWN most of the government.&&&52
Police / Fire - Newswatch&&&Wait, back up the old keyboard. Is the Fire Department sure of those times. "The 11:30 a.m.-alarm fire had the first unit on scene at 11:45 a.m." Previously in this article it said, "Firefighters extinguished the fire quickly partly because the fire station is just a half-mile from the home." Let's see, one half-mile from the fire station, 15 minutes for the first unit to respond. Did they walk to this blaze? Maybe they were right in the middle of lunch? Inquiring minds want to know as I only live one-half mile from our neighborhood fire station.&&&1

She wants furloughs and then she wants even more furloughs next year! If Hawaii state employees have to give up 36 days a year of income then other Gov. departments are going to be hit hard! With the average median income being $35k, not the reported $71k she said it was, then those people will all run to get food stamps and support from other State Government agencies just to survive. The federal Government matches some wages, if the state pays out less in wages then Hawaii is also losing out on Federal matched funds. Don't be sucked in by Lingle's LIES!&&&200

BMI not ideal in assigning 'perfect' weight - Facts of the Matter&&&Wouldn't body fat % be the best measurement? regardless of build/weight, if you have a high body fat percent, you are at a higher risk of health issues, so i would think that picking certain %'s as goals for athletic, fitness/healthy/acceptable and obese would be better. All you really need to do is look at someone and you can kind of tell if they are at a healthy weight. If a guy is 5'10", 220lbs and "soft", you can see that he needs to lower his body fat percent, but if he looks like a professional football fullback, he's probably at a healthy weight in regards to his body fat percent in relation to his lean mass. Shouldn't be that hard. BMI doesn't accuately reflect the CONDITION of the body it's measuring, only the numbers it reads. Terrible!&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Obama`s reforms will do harm. He keeps saying we`ll have choices in health care carriers,but fact is, individual private health care companies will not be able to sign up any new patients, so will go under quickly, giving us NO choices. When questioned about this provision in his bill, he said he wasn`t familiar with it!! How convenient! Seems that is a key factor, whether or not we will have a choice. We won`t, but he won`t tell us that. With the government`s track record, I don`t want to trust them/it with my life.&&&22
Birthday Bash 19 - Hawaii Features&&&The birthday bash is an annual event that is great for Hawaiian music. It's too bad the people who attend are such animals that they leave a sea of trash covering the grass of the Shell every year. Of all the concerts at the Shell this group leaves the most trash behind on the ground. Ii would help if the entertainers encouraged the audience to pack their own trash and to leave the grounds in a better condition than when they arrived.&&&1

B&B - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr. Fanger, you failed to address the issue that of the 5500 businesses you located, that represents 5500 homes that have been taken out of the local housing inventory. And please don't tell me that our homeless can't afford to rent them anyway so it doesn't matter. The result of 5500 homes out of the housing market means there is more downwards pressure on the remaining houses with those at the bottom eventually being pushed out altogether. And that $160 million you mention. How much of it really stays here. Many of the vacation rentals are owned by investors on the mainland who ship the money home. By the way, your denials of free weddings at your property ring hollow in light of the revelations made in the news article about your business. I do wish DPP had time to go after all 5500 operators but even if it's one at a time, I'm glad they started with you.&&&22
Bellows beach closure plan upsets neighbors - Hawaii News&&&Perhaps the neighborhood board would find it acceptable to pay a small admission fee, $10/day or so, to pay for increased civilian security patrols.

HPD offers house checks for vacationing residents - Hawaii News&&&HPD really does need a non-emergency number for people to contact them regarding requests such as these. 911 should be for emergency only, not to get info or have paperwork brought to a person. A uniformed officer is going to be taken away from important duty just to bring someone paperwork? Can't a person requesting the service go in to the station and provide ID and proof of residence along with photos of the home and special instructions about dogs or other hazards? We need to lighten the load on our Police Officers to keep them focused on the real work out there.&&&12

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr. Yanabe, I'm happy that for your daughter that she is gainfully employed. I think you are missing the mark when you only compare percentages. If you do the math you'll see that a 5% reduction from $100,000 is a higher dollar amount than that same percentage from $60,000. On the surface both parties give up 5% but only one gives up more kala.&&&32
Hawaii's tourism strategy flawed - Hawaii Editorials&&&Going to Hong Kong instead of Hawaii this fall after 11 years of vacationing in Hawaii. Hawaii turn-offs are: 1) Homeless. 2) Bad roads. The freeze/thaw cycle must really be bad there. When they DO work on the road, it takes multiple years, unless the hotels are paying for the improvement. 3) HPD jaywalking stings versus going after the dope smokers in plain sight.&&&45

Lagoon Drive parking to see fireworks a dud - Hawaii News&&&I also went to Lagoon Drive to view the fireworks on the 4th of July. It was the first time I had been there. It was a wonderful place to view the fireworks, mostly because people were very quiet and it wasn't crowded like Ala Moana. I spoke to some others there who also were there for the first time, and unsure of how things "worked" (where to park etc). We enjoyed ourselves and before the end of the show the cops came and chased us all away like we were criminals. Now, I wanted to state that I didn't see any "notice" about any restrictions about where the public was allowed (or not allowed) to gather on Lagoon Drive.(I looked online, and there were no signs that night) There are marked parking stalls on Lagoon Drive near the end of the drive. Other than that, there are private parking lots lining Lagoon Drive (where people could park illegally, I suppose). I'm sure I'm not the only one who figured that since there was marked parking on the street a few feet away, it would be better to park on the side of a public street for 20 minutes rather than park in a private lot. The point is that if people knew what the restrictions were, there would have been better compliance. The stretch of water along Lagoon Drive looks like a park; I'm not surprised people may have thought it was a public park (grills and sparklers). I'm sorry that I didn't know the rules, but I take offense at the idea that people just disregarded the "trust" that the Department of Transportation offered the public. Give the public another chance, and remind us of the restrictions in that area; I think you'll see better compliance.&&&4

Islam Day draws heat for isles - Hawaii News&&&The purpose of Hawaii Islam Day is supposedly to learn about Islam. OK, letâs learn: Islam has a history of a¢ 270 million killed, with over 80 million in India alone! a¢ slavery both much longer and in much larger numbers than the European trans-Atlantic slavery. The male Black slaves were commonly castrated by their Islamic owners! a¢ severe oppression of the conquered Christians and Jews based on the Islamic legal doctrine of inequality. a¢ forcible conversions of Hindus and other non-Abrahamic religions deemed "idolatrous". Islamic Jew-hatred is based on words of Muhammad. Modern Islam has inherited the Nazi Jew-hatred form the defeated Nazi Germany. Hundreds of the most wanted WWII Nazi criminals found refuge in Arab-Muslim countries where they assisted the local governments in their war on Jews. Perhaps the most inhuman is the Islamic oppression of women.-- Koran condones: a¢ wife beating with a stick, a¢ child marriage a¢ rape of "infidel" women a¢ Men have a legally higher status then women in the Islamic court of law a¢ Islamic law supports honor killing leading to death of 5000 women/year a¢ Half of girls and women in Islam had their genitals mutilation often cutting out clitoris! The civil liberties, that we take for granted, are contrary to the Islamic law: a¢ No freedom of religion Muslims who change religion are beheaded a¢ No freedom of expression: Anyone who criticizes Islam, or Muhammad is liable to be beheaded. a¢ Today in the countries of Western Europe, where there is a sizable Muslim minority, ordinary people are afraid to speak up. a¢ In America it is increasingly difficult to publish book or article critical of Islam as the publisher receives death threats from Muslims. All of the 55 Muslim countries in the world: a¢ have terrible human rights record. a¢ are poor, uneducated, unhealthy and filthy with exception of the Oil Emirates.&&&8

Ahhhh, another day in the Nei.&&&13
Odumba Health Plan&&&The Majority in Congress and the President are promising to change the "status quo" by pushing a government-run-medicine plan (HR 3200). The plan would create rationing through government committees, FORCE all Americans to buy over-priced, politically created health insurance, create an economically unsustainable government-run insurance plan, and impose economy-crushing taxes. In fact, the President would break yet another promise by imposing a 2.5% income tax on each person who refused to buy government improved insurance. Further, after 2013 people would be FORCED to stay in their current plan for LIFE or buy only a government-approved plan since no further enrollment will be allowed in non-approved insurance. Insurance companies would profit endlessly from the free business of the mandate. As medical care demands increased and artificially high profit margins became unacceptably low (for them) they would join the bailout game. In other words, there would be absolutely no change to the status quo  just an expansion of more people into the currently bad system with the added feature of state-sanctioned rationing of medical care. More than 88 million Americans could LOSE their private, employer-based coverage, according to a new analysis of "The American Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009"&&&3

DBEDT needs to initiate the paperwork." So you have the Governor vetoing a bill to downsize state government, and you have DBEDT sitting on their rear while the Natural Energy Laboratory languishes away? I think we found some savings here!&&&2

While those beliefs, traditions and cultural aspects SHOULD be preserved, they shouldn't be the guiding source for the future. The TMT will go the way of other advancements in Hawaii. Down the toilet as a bow to Stone Age thinking. The latest of which was the Super Ferry. Unbelievable! Damage to the mountain top? What damage? Its a mountain top. Glaciers once covered it.

Let's same-day register. But let's not fool ourselves. If you really care about voter turnout, get behind a better crop of candidates.

Linda Lingle has had some serious "Ooops" moments during her tour as our Governor, however, one person does not make a band. Our democratic legislators, in their supposed infinite wisdom, have done more damage to the citizens of this State, then any lone governor could ever accomplish. Yet this next election cycle will find those loyal blind democrats again, "like lemmings rushing to the sea" rushing to return their incumbents back to office. As for our distinguished God Father Inouye, of course he will attempt to soften the nest for whoever the next democrat running for governor, whether it be Neil or Mufi, will be by creating his negative spin on Lingle.

I HATE when people stand close to the carousel, waiting for their bags. They should wait 3 feet away, then go forward only when their bag comes out. As it is now, you can't see your bag come out, and if/when you do, you gotta fight through the crowd to get it, and then you hit people with it while getting it off the carousel.

Batten the hatches, a perfect storm is near - On Politics&&&If legislators in 2010 would stop substituting a particularly hateful form of christianity for the Constitution and passed CIVIL MARRIAGE EQUALITY, the state could expect upwards of $100 million in revenue in three years. The Williams Institute has conducted numerous studies within the last year alone of the economic impact of marriage equality in Maine, Vermont, and D.C.; the amount of money spent on weddings, and taxes and fees for licensing aren't small change. How many couples already come here from around the world to get married every day? Not only would hundreds (at elast) of Hawaii couples get married right here at home, hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples from the continental U.S., and countries worldwide could come here for their dream wedding. How much money in taxes and fees would that generate? How much money would the hospitality industry make? Hawaiian Airlines, cab and car companies, hotels, florists, photographers, tux rentals, licensed officiators would all see a surge in business, creating jobs and putting money into the local economy throughout the islands. Let's get real - we all know that legislators care about money and votes. How many would be willing to trade the shrinking christian bigot vote for a huge surge of revenue in a state with a rapidly-failing economy, dependent on tourism? I'm actually shocked it didn't occur to them earlier this year when they had the chance. Don't take my word for it. See for yourself.(all links are to .pdf files) $60 million in revenue in three years and 1,000 new jobs in Maine $31 million in revenue in three years and 700 new jobs in Vermont. $52 million in revenue in three years and 700 new jobs in D.C.&&&1

Legislators, take voluntary pay cuts, too - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Senate President Colleen Hanabusa, who reports making between $150,000 to $250,000 a year from her law practice, argues that legislators cannot reduce their government salaries without violating the state Constitution. That does not explain how the legislators were allowed to reduce their salaries by 5 percent during the session in response to public outrage to their pay hikes. Would you like to explain to the taxpayers Hanabooboo the fact that the legislators reduced their salaries by 5% but you said they couldn't refuse the pay raise because it would violate the Constitution? Which is it?&&&101

Gambling risks outweigh any benefits to society - Guest Editorials&&&Aloha: We are smarter than people in 48 other states, where gambling is allowed and where everyone suffers in one way or another from having legalized it. Casinos and the mob and those who rip off the State-run lotteries, etc. do OK. Everyone else loses. And don't believe Hawaiian Airlines television commercial where they tell you that 99 percent of the people in Hawai`i gamble. They made that up to sell seats on flights to Las Vegas. Yes, lots of people gamble, but the majority in Hawai`i DON'T WANT LEGALIZED GAMBLING IN OUR ISLAND HOME, HAL's commercials notwithstanding. Me ka pono, Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&1
Problems show Hilo doctor reform needed - Hawaii Editorials&&&Doctor, By explaining the pain of having to deal with Medicare and Medicaid, you answered the question on why government should not run a healthcare plan. After all, why should any new government plan operate any differently? BTW, assuming you have privileges there, I'm sure that the hospital where you had your surgery, by now, wrote off your bill, as a professional courtesy. If not done at the hospital where you have privileges, I'd guess that your surgeon or other colleagues called the hosipital administration on your behalf.&&&11

Union members for Layoffs&&&I work for the State and still emphatically say, go forward with the Layoffs. Before you say that I'm saying this because I know I will not be laid off, let me tell you that I am one of the State employees who is quite low on the totem poll and will very likely receive my walking papers. I am an engineer and work in a department with MANY other engineers and Corner Office people. In fact, there are so many of us that the oldest ones (several Corner Office people) with the most seniority essentially receive or make up the work orders and pass them on to the department heads who then pass the work order on to a specific project manager engineer who passes the work order on the the site engineer who then meets with sometimes a small team of (Low man) engineers (Me) who will get the actual work done along with the construction tradesmen. If there is the same amount of fat in every State of Hawaii department as mine,(and I expect there is), I am truly disgusted. If the Lay Offs happen, probably 6 engineers and myself will be gone. That will save the state about $700,000 per year when you factor in the State's health care contribution, workers comp. etc. The sad thing is that the,Corner Office people, will still be there doing very little. Layoff's will force some of the middle managers actually go back out and do some work instead of supervising and the then the upper managers will have a little more to do too. There will not however, be any disruption of services from my department because there is just sooo much fat. Another sad thing is that some of these,Corner Office people and High level managers are very talented engineers and architects but the New Hires don't learn anything from them because now, late in their careers, all they do is push paper. One of my high up bosses is a living legend in the field who in his prime, created many amazing solutions to engineering problems unique to Hawaii. I would love to be able to actually confer with him on projects but he's simply is not available high up in his room with a view... I will be fine. As soon as layoffs were mentioned I started to float resumes and I already have a placement waiting in the private sector. I would however, prefer to stay with the state simply because of the type of work I'm doing for them but right now, I can't be choosy. It is important for the state to cut the fat and let the people with seniority get back to work.&&&6

'Mean' homeless report skewed - Hawaii Editorials&&&I will feel better if Hawaii is ranked no. 1 in meanness to homeless inhabitants as we should pass more ordaninances preventing the homeless from using the parks, restrooms, benches, sleeping on sidewalks etc. and just round them up and put them on a plane and ship them to some remote island in the Pacific. I AM SICK OF THESE DAMM LIBERALS protecting the rights of the homeless as long as its not in their backyard. All of these liberals should, for all sense and purposes, take in these homeless individuals or families and that would eliminate the problem on the streets. All of these liberals are just hypocrites....all talk and no action.&&&21

Revisit seat-belt law for truck-bed riders - Hawaii Editorials&&&How many more people have to die before Hawaii wakes up to the fact that a seatbelt law is for everyone? If there are no seatbelts in the back of a pickup truck, then it should be illegal to ride in the back. Yesterday, I saw four guys riding in the back of a pickup truck drinking beer out of a cooler which I believe is illegal. A 20 year old girl (graduate from Roosevelt) school just died over the weekend by being thrown from the back of a pickup. This is a senseless loss of precious lives and is unnecessary. We have a click it or ticket law which is a joke if you continue to allow people to ride in the back of trucks unrestrained. I called KSSK to discuss this issue today on the radio and all I got back is....the laws are vague in this area and they hung up. Hawaii has a tendency to be apathetic about most issues. I have lived here for 20 years and normally I don't get too emotional over issues, but to see young people or old people die for no good reason is a real shame. I'm sure we could all agree that if it was one of our loved ones that died as a result of this situation, that we would have a different perspective. We need to look at this situation from the perspective of the victim and change our laws to protect the lives of our keiki.&&&1

I have said and still say that both the State and C&C could save a bundle if they did away with all these Deputy Directors, Assistant Directors, Assistant to the Assistant Directors, etc. ad nasum. To much fluff at the top.&&&13
Carter still has his bruises - Hawaii Sports&&&I remember that Notre Dame game. UH recovered an onsides kick late in the game, went on to score to make it close, but weren't able to convert again on the ensuing onsides kick. I remember Doug Vaioleti going like 50 yards of the now banned fumblerooski play. You should have seen that big Tongan rumbling, bumbling and stumbling down the field. That game saved Bob Wagner's butt. If UH doesn't come back late in the game, he was gone. Then he ties for the WAC title (with 2 losses) the next year and that saved his butt for another 3 years. Hugh Yoshi-da is a hell of a good man and he would never ever fire anyone unless it absolutely had to be done. Bob Wagner was lucky to have lasted as long as he did at UH. Bonb Wagner is a good guy, was a good D coordinator, but a horrible head coach.&&&25

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&While Bush might have put us in a hole, Obama has buried us 3 times deeper and is still shoveling!

We have far higher survival rates for many cancers than Canada and the UK due to expedited care, which we will lose under his govt.plan. Add another 15-20 million illegals to the plan, to whom he`s sure to give amnesty to, factor in the doctor shortage and we`re stuck with nowhere to go. Die heart Obama supporters can go on believing, but I think in the end, the change they wind up with is not something they`re going to be happy with. Time will tell and we`re betting our very lives on it!&&&247

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Americans, let's not let Mexican problems invade America ... let's endeavor to have American freedom and justice invade Mexico!". Well put. Guess what? I've got a concrete proposal for accomplishing just that. The age-old pesky U.S.-Mexico border problem has taxed the resources of both countries, led to long lists of injustices, and appears to be heading only for worse troubles in the future. Guess what? The border problem can never be solved. Why? Because the border IS the problem! It's time for a paradigm change. Never fear, a satisfying, comprehensive solution is within reach: the Megamerge Dissolution Solution. Simply dissolve the border along with the failed Mexican government, and megamerge the two countries under U.S. law, with mass free 2-way migration eventually equalizing the development and opportunities permanently, with justice and without racism, and without threatening U.S. sovereignty or basic principles. Take time to Google "Megamerge Dissolution Solution" to read my proposal for a new paradigm for U.S.-Mexico relations.&&&1

DOE BUDGET&&&If you divide $2.4 billion dollars by 175,000 students you get $13,700 that should be appropriated to educate a child in Hawaii per year, and this amount is the highest in the nation. The actual amount that is spent by the DOE is $4,435 per student per year. The difference of $9,265 times 175,000 students is $1,621,375,000 that is not going to educate the children of Hawaii is an enormous amount. This discrepancy is the reason Pat Hamamoto is not agreeing to a complete audit of the DOE. The State is going broke and will eventually end up going bankrupt. The State should reexamine the DOE budget and find the leakage or mismanagement of funds and what they find should bail out the State in this economic crisis.&&&1

Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&Regarding catfishing and DLNR. Thielen originally cancelled the fishing, now she partially reinstitutes it, thus saving the day, or so it would seem. But if you consider all the tens of thousands of dollars she has spent on assault weapons for DLNR in recent years, then one needs to question her management ability. She's an embarrassment to the administration. Thankfully her tenure at DLNR ends when the next governor is elected.&&&2

Where was Obama born? Not in a Honolulu hospital&&&Read the entire article at: __________ __________ BORN IN THE USA? Obama's 'birth hospital' in astonishing cover-up Once proudly celebrated president, now in active mode to hide 'proof' __________ Posted: July 10, 2009 11:49 pm Eastern By Joe Kovacs © 2009 WorldNetDaily The Honolulu hospital which for nearly six months proudly declared President Obama was born at its facility and used that claim as a major fund-raising tool is now engaged in an active cover-up, hiding a White House letter announcing his alleged birth there and refusing to confirm such a letter even exists. The Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women and Children is electronically cloaking what it had touted as a Jan. 24 letter from the president, in which the commander in chief, just four days after his inauguration, supposedly wrote, "As a beneficiary of the excellence of Kapi'olani Medical Center  the place of my birth  I am pleased to add my voice to your chorus of supporters." WND was first to question the authenticity of the letter by revealing the image displayed on the hospital's website was not the image of an actual paper letter, but merely a computer..........&&&6
Don't delay short-term rental bill - Hawaii Editorials&&&The State should legalize short term rentals. They would be able to collect taxes from them. Tourist should have an option if they do not want to stay in Waikiki. Tourist usually cause much less trouble than long term renters in vacation homes. They only require one parking space as they usually only rent one car as opposed to local renters that have tons of friends over if you lived near the ocean or a desirable vacation spot. During the day the usually go site seeing. Which means they usually use the place for sleeping quarters. If they stay on the property, they just lie in the sun not causing much trouble. They usually don't have many friends at their vacation destinations. If the State were smart they would legalize thereby be able to collect taxes to support their budget. Where is the harm?&&&8

Patrons and politicians plead to keep libraries open - Hawaii News&&&Interesting ... the infamous "robber barons," some out of guilt and others out of a studied generosity, created some impressive public benefits. Carnegie, the steel man (I think that was his main source of riches) took it upon himself to build, furnish, and stock with books many public libraries, which remain. We live now in a time in which there are many rich; and Hawaii has a huge share of them; but where are the philanthropists? To allow public libraries to close, after starving them of funds for years is scandalous. Never forget that this state enjoyed at least three decades of hugely profitable tourism during which billions of dollars were spent here. Now we are left with crumbling roads, bankrupt hospitals, infrastructure decay (sewer, water, waste) and now the closing of the only really free indoor public resource that many have access to. Closing libraries is more than closing a building; it represents closing opportunities and access for those who cannot afford to buy books and magazines and who need those resources very much. Again ... where are the philanthropists among all the rich who can afford the beachfront mansions and big boats and who would have us believe that they are good. Can they not emulate the best behavior of those who seized America's resources during the Industrial Revolution, but, at least, saw enough of the light to benefit society with the gift of libraries.&&&37

Shield airlines from oil tax risk - Hawaii Editorials&&&How dumb! The entire consuming public pays for electricity, bread, gas, EVERYTHING that we buy comes in or is made with oil/energy. Taxing is not the answer. More taxes on some (consumers) and more breaks for others (airlines) is the wrong way to go. Prices of oil products and electricity are high enough to encourage cost effective alternatives now; we do not need to raise prices and costs just to give folks more incentive. A tax is simply pushing us further into personal bankruptcy and drives any business out of our state.&&&22

I have read that there are 6 genes that are suspected to cause this skin disorder, and depending on which genes are expressing themselves determines what form of the disease you have. I am lucky that the effects are only skin deep. If you are unlucky in the gene lottery psoriasis can go internal and cause arthritis and attack organs.&&&6

Carlisle to run for mayor when Hannemann leaves - Hawaii News&&&Wow, what a fantastic development that extends hope to the People of Honolulu taxed to death under the Mufi Regime. Soon to be gone are the days of the Mufi minion union money orgy bleeding us all dry while enriching the insiders. The mere mention by the article of Caldwell being a "successor" to Mufi strikes a dischordenant and yet similar noise coming from North Korea, where Kim Jong Il is grooming little Hilter Jr., and his son, Kim Jong Un, to take over the reigns of power and subjugation. No one can dispute that Caldwell is an empty, personality-less, too slick, shallow duplicate of Mufi. As difficult as that may be to conceive, it is true that yes, Caldwell is even more shallow than Mufi. Caldwell also displays a lack of astuteness, failure to pay attention to detail, as proven by his failure to timely meet deadlines resulting in his loss of opportunity to win at the polls, but nonetheless rewarded by Mufi with a cabinet post. Even the Democrats despise Caldwell but their weakening grip on the People, strengthened by the People waking up like a sleeping Giant to the union political influence and the corruption that is an integral part of the union-government incestuous relationship, will, I think, result in the People expressing their frustration with the usurious tax hikes and extortion resulting from unchecked Democratic Party of Hawaii control. Revolution is always caused by the People finally having had enough. Insanity is repeating Democratic Party Domination expecting a different result.&&&61

Obama Reality&&&By Steven Thomma, McClatchy Newspapers Steven Thomma, Mcclatchy Newspapers  Thu Jul 16, 6:00 am ET WASHINGTON  Americans are divided over how they want health care fixed and whom they trust most to do it, refusing to forge a consensus for or against President Barack Obama as he and Congress march toward a historic overhaul. The lack of a popular consensus underscores the risks and stakes as Congress rushes toward proposals to provide coverage to the uninsured and rein in soaring costs for those who do have coverage. Obama and the Democrats who control Congress are pressing toward a vast overhaul of the health care system that could include tax increases to pay for expanded coverage and a federal government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers as one way to try to rein in insurance costs. Most Republican lawmakers say that a public plan would drive private insurers out of business. One possible reason Obama doesn't have a more commanding position is that he's lost support in recent weeks, as Americans have grown more skeptical about the state of the country. The survey found the ranks of people who think the country is on the right track dropping to 40 percent, down 12 points since early June and the lowest since Obama took office in January. As unemployment continues to rise, Americans who say the country' s on the wrong track jumped to 54 percent, a 12-point rise and the highest since Obama took office. The number of Americans who approve of the way Obama is doing his job also dropped, to 57 percent, a 7-point decline from early June and the lowest of his presidency that McClatchy-Ipsos has recorded. His biggest loss of support was among independents, whose approval decreased from 58 percent to 50 percent. However, he also lost ground among Democrats, down 5 points, and Republicans, down 3 points. Notably, the total of Americans who "strongly" approve of Obama's job performance dropped 11 points in a month, to 29 percent, his lowest ever. Conversely, 22 percent said they strongly disapprove, up 6 points and the highest of his six months in office. On other health care questions, the poll found that Americans:  Support tax breaks to small businesses to help provide insurance, by 91-8 percent.  Want the government to have the power to negotiate drug prices, by 71-25.  Want to order businesses to offer insurance to employees, by 70-28.  Support mandating individuals to have insurance, by 69-26.  Want limits on malpractice awards against health care providers, by 62-31.  Support higher taxes on alcoholic beverages to help pay for health care, by 59-39.  Oppose higher taxes on soft drinks, by 51-42.  Oppose a national sales tax or value added tax, by 61-32.  Oppose taxing people on the value of their employer-provided health insurance, by 64-32. The survey, which was taken last Thursday through Monday, has an error margin of 3.09 percentage points&&&1

Attention and exercise can stop barking - Hawaii Features&&&Please ... anthropomorphizing animals (attributing human traits to them) is wrong; dogs in no way "talk" and saying that they do creates an illusion of intelligence and human-like capability that they can never achieve. The ever increasing problem of barking dogs is ruining many neighborhoods, and the truth of it is that many selfish dog owners actually encourage their animals to bark because the owners either do not care or they want the noise to deter trespassing. Dogs can be made to stop barking by placing an anti-bark collar on them, which will apply either an electric pulse or a spray of citronella. Or they could simply get rid of these nuisances to help restore peace to their neighborhoods.&&&4

Did you know? - Imperial Visit&&&Aloha: Susan wrote: Akihito took the throne as the 125th emperor of Japan on Nov. 12, 1990. His ancestors had been revered as demigods with their lineage reputedly stretching back more than 2,000 years to the origins of the nation. If this is true, who was the emperor of Japan between the death of Tenno Showa on January 7, 1989 and Nov. 12, 1990? I think you will find that Crown Prince Akihito became the 125th emperor, Tenno Heika, upon the death of his father, Tenno Showa (known outside Japan as Emperor Hirohito). Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&1
Internet tax would bring in dollars - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Meanwhile, Hawaii's brick-and-mortar bookstores will have to continue watching readers browse the racks in order to decide what books to order on the Internet." No, the bookstores don't have accept this situation! They can demand that the Governor sign the "Amazon Law" that the legislature has enacted. How ironic that at this moment, at least, there is an ad for the Amazon Kindle right next to this editorial. The Star-Bulletin itself evidently is an Amazon affiliate. Does that explain its failure to endorse the "Amazon Law"?&&&47
KHON-TV parent files for bankruptcy - Hawaii Business&&&Media consolidation at it's finest...

NanKing&&&In December of 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army marched into China's capital city of Nanking and proceeded to murder 300,000 out of 600,000 civilians and soldiers in the city. The six weeks of carnage would become known as the Rape of Nanking and represented the single worst atrocity during the World War II era in either the European or Pacific theaters of war. The actual military invasion of Nanking was preceded by a tough battle at Shanghai that began in the summer of 1937. Chinese forces there put up surprisingly stiff resistance against the Japanese Army, which had expected an easy victory in China. The Japanese had even bragged they would conquer all of China in just three months. The stubborn resistance by the Chinese troops upset that timetable, with the battle dragging on through the summer into late fall. This infuriated the Japanese and whetted their appetite for the revenge that was to follow at Nanking. After finally defeating the Chinese at Shanghai in November, 50,000 Japanese soldiers then marched on toward Nanking. Unlike the troops at Shanghai, Chinese soldiers at Nanking were poorly led and loosely organized. Although they greatly outnumbered the Japanese and had plenty of ammunition, they withered under the ferocity of the Japanese attack, and then engaged in a chaotic retreat. After just four days of fighting, Japanese troops smashed into the city on December 13, 1937, with orders issued to "kill all captives."&&&5

Lingle signs bill on land sales - Hawaii News&&&The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the public lands of Hawai'i belong to all the people of Hawaii in fee simple absolute, with no racial restrictions. See my complete history of the case including full text of all the decisions, oral arguments, and legal briefs by principals and amici: Regarding the new law requiring 2/3 approval by both the Hawaii House and Hawaii Senate before the Governor can sell any ceded lands: That law can be changed by a simple majority of both houses anytime in the future. No Legislature can force any future Legislature to abide by any restrictions -- the only way to bind future Legislatures is with a Constitutional amendment. Unfortunately the new law does not stop a Governor from transferring all of the ceded lands to the future Akakakanaka tribe. That's exactly what Governor Abercrombie will do.&&&11

It's time to solve budget dilemma - Hawaii Editorials&&&A one-day/month furlough or a 5% pay cut seems like a reasonable first step. It should not preclude further measures if the first step turns out not to be enough. Those further measures could be lengthening the furloughs to 2 or 3 days/month or layoffs. Union leaders and Lingle should agree to meet quarterly to see whether additional measures are called for. Now is the time for the union leadership, which has really dropped the ball on this, to repair its damaged credibility by stepping up to the plate and working with the governor on a furlough agreement.&&&50

'His heart was open to the spirit of aloha' - Hawaii News&&&From Kula, Maui, Hawaii to Rome, Italy and there working for 24 and a half years. Remarkable. Piers evolving presentation on Damien portrays him as "a happy man, a holy man ... and a true Hawaiian." A true Hawaiian. "I don't want us to focus so much on Damien that we miss the point that he is only exemplifying what Jesus did for us a long time ago. I don't want Damien to obscure the source from whence he got that grace." That's it.&&&7
Michael Jackson for a price - Hawaii Business&&&Yes MJ was talented. If you liked him that's good, If you didn't, that O.K. too. But the world doesn't stop spinning because MJ's heart stopped. The reality is that it was already known by the L.A. District Attorney's office that MJ had a huge prescription drug habit back in 2004 during the infamous "child molestation" allegation trial. Why wasn't there an investigations ino the enabling doctors who prescribed the drugs under false/illegal pretenses back then? What this says is, in America if you have money, position or are a celebrity, the legal authorities look the other way because of well paid lawyers on fat retainers that enforce the law and keep accuntability at bay. Remember Anna Nicole Smith? Sadly this wasn't first case that ended like this, nor will it be the last. We all were deprived of REAL news because of this Hollywood Circus. Makes me wonder what was being orchestrated behind the public's back while we heard/saw nothing but MJ gossip and plugs for the future DVD of the "THIS IS IT" rehersals. This just one more story of the "failure of success, the abuse of excess & no self control". You in the media failed to limit the air time/print space to a reasonable amount. In this days of declining TV news viewership & numerous failing daily newspapers, you just know how to pander to the "rumor hungry public" & make a buck for your corporate mogol employers.&&&4

Bottom line is that his carelessness resulted in the death of his soldier. SGT Vegaquinones gets three years in jail and a dishonorable discharge for negligence.

BILLIONS MORE will be needed to FIX the problem unless CHANGED. Read the REPORT SEE what the Sea Level Rail Route will look like here- The RAIL ROUTE will see advance of the ocean inland- In Mapunapuna, baby hammerhead sharks swim in 2 foot deep pools- land is sinking and inland sea flooding drains. see Waikiki in just a matter of decades- The FTA and EPA will NOT approve this route! Do you believe MUFI, YOSHIOKA and APO- Or UH Ocean Scientists??? "In Hawaii, sea-level rise resulting from global warming is a real concern." says UH SOEST 1. Marine inundation of low-lying developed areas including coastal roads, 2. Erosion of beaches and bluffs, 3. Salt intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, 4. Higher water tables, and 5. Increased flooding and storm damage. Roadways that are too close to the shoreline should be rerouted away from the ocean. Waikiki hotels should include rising sea-level countermeasures when undergoing renovations.

All of these do not require good education. Parents, uncles, neighbors, friends, athlete heroes. They all say, "NO NEED!" Here comes Obama and ambitious socialist welfare programs to keep it going. Why study, why work when government will give you free ride. Meanwhile, our money goes to waste.&&&47

The manager Joy Westrum violated the terms of her lease (by allowing in violent prisoners) and left town in the middle of the night (owing hundreds of thousands of dollars). TV news reports from KRQE-TV of Albuquerque concerning the "Second Chance" scam in their area, can be seen at:&&&3
Gannett lowers boom on 1,400 more workers - Hawaii Business&&&Printed news is dead yet the internet media is booming. The news papers should have taken a hint from the ink printing industries a long time ago. Now everything can be done with a home PC and a $45 dollar printer. It not bad it's just change.&&&22
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Every previous governor had a director of finance that was smart, analytical, and had a certain amount of sophistication. Each clearly also had the ear of their bosses. I don't know about the current one. Does anyone know? Please share what you know or have heard. Thank you.&&&9

Hoku Scientific looks at options for survival - Hawaii Business&&&Tens of millions in tax payer funds spent to finance Hoku (via Act 221). In exchange, 28 employees (maybe even some more!) Plus now a fire sale. For tens of millions, the state gets a few dozen jobs for less than a decade and an impending collapse. Another Act 221 Winnah!&&&22

No shame in stuffing the ballot box for Shane - Hawaii Sports&&&Major League Baseball lost it's ethics a long time ago when they failed to discipline the first druggie, wife beater, or steroid user with punishment more serious than a slap on the wrist.

School contracts under scrutiny - Hawaii News&&&This should come as no surprise to anyone in Hawaii. Again it represents that this ship, the DOE, has no captain and continually flounders with mismanagement. "Hamamoto said that after the audit, the department made changes and has become more diligent in applying "checks and balances," including the way it picks people to decide on awarding contracts." Seems like Hamamoto's crew has yet again let her down in doing their job, but of course, as the captain of this ship, the DOE, it falls on her shoulders, rightfully.&&&95

Calvin merged morality with precepts of freedom - Hawaii Features&&&It's interesting that the headline links Kalawina with precepts of freedom, yet we see no freedom of worship in Puritan New England, and we discover in his doctrine of predestination a repudiation of the doctrine of free will. Obviously the above is a little simplistic, but nevertheless, the headline isn't supported by any evidence in the article, and I'm not convinced it's accurate.&&&2
Waianae ER needs money triage - Hawaii Editorials&&&Center administrators said they are reaching out to Hawaii's congressional delegation for help in urging Medicare to make an administrative change and recognize WCCHC's urgent-care services as a fully eligible emergency department, thereby raising reimbursements.

Man not guilty in assault case - Hawaii News&&&Both of these idiots should be put in jail. First of all, who the hell would believe that kicking the steering whole on a moving motor vehicle isn't going to cause that motor vehicle to moving in a direction other than intended and thereby possibly causing an accident. The wife admits that she was drunk, took her eyes off the road to hit her husband. What if her actions had caused serious injury or death to innocent people that were driving near her. It is obvious that there needs to be some kind of punishment given to both husband and wife for their irresponsible actions.&&&29

Value of seed companies in isles continues to grow - Business News&&&What percentage of island born residents do seed companies hire? I have researched both sides of this issue and oppose gmo's vehemently. I urge Hawai'i residents to do indepentent research on this life threatening issue. Every environmental group, many scientists and numerous concerned citizens are swiftly and aptly contributing to the multitude of books and dvds on the subject. READ both sides. You'll find WAY MORE info. on the risks associated with gmo's. GO TO THE LIBRARY! WE need to make EDUCATED choices! There are lots of crazy scientists here right now that feel that the public need not know that we are part of the open field testing without public consent. TRANSPARENCY is the LAW. We have a right to know EVERYTHING. And the right to say NO!&&&3
Joan Manke - Hawaii Editorials&&&There is nowhere else that you can go to attend a meeting where a member of ALL of the following attend: Police Dept Fire Dept Board of Water Mayor's Rep City Councilman or rep or both State Representive(s) or rep or both State Senator(s) or rep or both Governor's rep If I left anyone out of the list, I apologize. Questions can be asked of any or all of these representatives and they are responded to or referred to the proper agency. The question becomes part of the minutes of the meeting does require a follow up. People are called to task at for their responses. If political double talk is used as a response, YOU, as part of the public asking the question have the ability to ask for a honest answer. It becomes blatantly obvious to all when the political BS is happening. There are very few prepared answers in this format. You find out much that you cannot see on TV or read in the newspaper about a person who is right there in front of you. WHERE ELSE can you get this kind of attention on a topic? No where but at the neighborhood board meetings! Try it, you will find it interesting and definitely NOT BORING! Better yet, RUN and make a difference: I did!&&&4

Ilikai employees fear for future - Hawaii News&&&Seeing the demonstrators would scare any hotel owner from keeping the hotel open and having to deal with militant union workers. I don't think it helps their cause. They demonstrated earlier when the hotel units were being foreclosed upon and it was a stupid thing to do then. What bidder would want to deal with workers like that? It is no wonder the new owners are laying off the workers. Besides losing hundreds of thousands of dollars each month, they are probably thinking of ways to avoid dealing with the militant hotel workers. The new owners should sell the units off as condo units so they don't have to deal with militant union hotel workers.&&&66

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Steve Laracuente wrote: "Help needed for the uninsured" Everyone in America already can get FREE medical care which costs a fortune. Now you want to "GIVE" them insurance and add to that cost. Sorry, bad plan. You say you have good insurance. Well not for long. Faced with paying taxes on that your employer will probably dump you into that new cheap government pool and your CARE will drop along with it (You do get what you pay for). "American citizen or not" Why not give every citizen in the world a free airplane ticket to come here anytime they get sick? Sorry, I for one am sick and tired of funding these illegals who are sucking our system dry because of bleeding heart liberals like you...who do NOT mind spending other peoples money for your social experiments. Enough is enough. The government has no business being in direct competition with the private sector. Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves at this very moment.

Double charge for cars and bikes at airport ends - Hawaii News&&&Only the HI state Department of Transportation could willfully screw up airport parking, charging double for those who rode motorcycles and/or cars depending on the weather. Then to say through spokesperson Tammy Mori "we expect that something would be worked out." HIDOT caught again with their hand in the cookie jar is in no hurry to refund the small amount. Hey, this is the same agency that changed the airport signs from clearly legible/visible to the unreadable/wrong color sign, then finally admit they totally screwed up and redid them again at taxpayer expense. Hello, you failed to read the standards for airport signage! Truely HIDOT is an engine and rudderless ship out of water. So what else is new? Just another day in the little third world of Hawaii Nei.&&&6

Yes, they are number 1 all right in that category. Even though they called themselves the "largest" back in the day (1999), that questionable honor goes to Tommy Bahama, Reyns, Tori Richards and most of the other aloha wear firms that have global sales, not just in Hawaii like Hilo Hattie. I hope they succeed but for a 24 employee firm to buy one with 200 employees is very strange.&&&2

Where: Doris Duke Theater 900 S Beretania Street When: July 23rd & 24th at 1pm and 7:30pm About Dear & Yonder  Roxy is pleased to announce its partnership with noted surf filmmakers Tiffany Campbell and Andria Lessler to produce their groundbreaking feature film Dear and Yonder. Documenting the most progressive surfing of today, Dear and Yonder follows top professionals including Roxy team riders Sally Fitzgibbons, Sofia Mulanovich and Kassia Meador, as they surf their home breaks (Dear) and travel the world (Yonder). In addition to chronicling todays surfers, Dear and Yonder spreads its roots deeper and cultivates a sense of place and knowledge of history, reaching back in time to unearth footage of iconic surfers such as Linda Benson, Rell Sunn and Lisa Andersen providing the historical foundation of womens surfing for the younger viewer. Shot by legendary surf cinematographers Thomas Campbell, Scott Soens and Dave Homcy the film captures the authenticity of each surfers experience through imagery, music and art that reflect the vision of the project. Filmmakers Tiffany Campbell and Andria Lessler tie these carefully crafted pieces together to tell a story that defies boundaries and demonstrates the inner spirit of the female surfer of both today and yesterday. For more information on the film and the event please visit .&&&1

True story. Devone and Ryan also owe some of their success to Jason, so many times we would see him level someone in the secondary while the other receivers ran into the endzone. Jason, please don't give up on your dream, you deserve to be playing some where!!!&&&1

The above quote is comparing apples to oranges. You are comparing a $50.00 a month health referral service to a $2,500 a month adult foster home care service or a $7,000 a month skilled nursing intermediate-care facility service. Let's be honest! They are vastly different. You must compare yourself with other health referral services within the State of Hawaii to be honest with your article. Which there are many!

Something the article fails to mention: the protestors are from the Green Party, supportors of the PREVIOUS President who staged his own assasination for sympathy, fixed elections, lied countless times, broke many laws, wasted the country's money on needless extravagant world trips, created more friction between China, embezzelled millions if not billions of money from the country, caused a huge economic decline from Taiwan's economic boom, and tried to change or deface national monuments which were created by or featured people of the opposing (Kuomingtang) party. Sound like any other current world leaders?&&&13
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Gimme a break! I'm so tired of the whining of the State Employees and their supporters. This is a UNIONIZED STATE and I think now, after all of this fooling around, it's time to BREAK the union. Show them that WE the TAXPAYERS will not be HELD HOSTAGE by their crying. Forget the furloughs, it's high time to implement the LAYOFFS and just do it, Gov. Lingle. Make sure that it's enough to cover the short fall. At the same time, you'll end up lowering the % of State workers which is way too high for a small state such as ours. That is a better choice than spreading it equally. It seems the State employees don't want equality for themselves. They want the TAXPAYER (who fund their checks!) to pay even more. It's the same old record, same old refrain. And for the record, the Hurricane Fund is just for that, NOT FOR STATE EMPLOYEE PAY CHECKS! Once again on the same broken record, look at private industry who have had pay cuts and then closed anyway....aka Aloha Airlines. Give these union people the book, also known as the furlough and be done with it.&&&6

Homeowners have upper hand - Hawaii Business&&&Don't buy a house! House prices will keep falling in most places because those prices are still dangerously high compared to incomes and rents. Banks say a safe mortgage is a maximum of 3 times the buyer's yearly income. Landlords say a safe price is a maximum of 15 times the tenant's yearly rent. Yet in coastal areas, both those safety rules are still being violated. Buyers are still borrowing 6 times their income, and sellers are still asking 30 times annual rent, even after recent price declines. Renting is a cash business that reflects what people can really pay, not how much they can borrow. Salaries and rents prove that prices will keep falling for a long time. Anyone who bought a "bargain" this time last year is already sitting on a very painful loss.&&&190

Barney Frank - lib liar we can't afford&&&When President Obama announced on June 9 that some financial institutions would be allowed to repay Troubled Asset Relief Program dollars, he said the massively expensive TARP bailout had made money for the federal government. "It is worth noting that in the first round of repayments from these [TARP recipients], the government has actually turned a profit,". But now Rep. Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has come up with a proposal to spend any TARP profits before they can be returned to the taxpayers. Last Friday, Frank introduced the "TARP for Main Street Act of 2009," a bill that would take profits from the program and immediately redirect them toward housing proposals favored by Frank and some fellow Democrats. In exchange for receiving TARP money, financial institutions were required to hand over shares of preferred stock that paid a dividend for the government. In theory, if a financial institution paid the dividend faithfully, and then repaid the TARP money, then the government would turn a profit. Last month, the General Accountability Office (GAO) reported that, through June 12, 2009, the government had received $6.2 billion in dividend payments. The original TARP legislation required that money made from the program "shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt." Frank, however, wants to spend the money before it can be used to pay down anything. First, the "TARP for Main Street" proposal would take $1 billion "from dividends paid by financial institutions that have received financial assistance provided underthe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act" and apply it to a trust fund that Frank has long wanted to create for low-income rental housing.(The measure, unfunded, was part of last year's bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.) Next, Frank would take $1.5 billion from TARP dividends for a so-called "neighborhood stabilization" fund. Both measures might allow federal dollars to be distributed to activist groups like ACORN. The "TARP for Main Street" bill would also spend $2 billion, apparently from remaining TARP funds, to subsidize people who are delinquent on their mortgages, and another $2 billion to "stabilize multifamily properties that are in default or foreclosure." Spending the dividend payments now, as Frank proposes, would reduce the chance that TARP might ever be a break-even deal for the taxpayers. "We don't know if TARP is going to be making any money, so taking the dividend payments going back to Treasury is pretty questionable," says one House GOP aide. Indeed, in its June report, the GAO revealed that 17 troubled institutions have not paid their dividends, much less repaid the TARP money itself. And last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that three other institutions were not paying dividends. But now, Frank is proposing that dividends be spent immediately. Change we can not afford.&&&7

Breeze of fresh air benefits Council race - Hawaii Editorials&&&For one thing, a genuine horticulturist (which Heidi Bornhorst surely is) who is also scion of a political family and knows thousands of people, might notice that dozens of properties all over the city, when no one is looking, allow their required hedges and trees to die or be removed, then do not replace them, leaving many a barren paved cityscape in place of what DPP and the Council intended to be a green and lush ornamented parking lot or commercial building frontage. A great city is seen in its small bits of gracefulness and care, and Honolulu cannot ride forever on good weather to attract tourists: our city should be graced with foliage throughout, at least to the extent that permits required when each last improvement was made. Imagine Nimitz highway with every parking lot and commercial building landscaped as well as the recent intersection makai of Costco has been. Voters should step outside of the political box and put Heidi onto the Council.&&&9

To the moon - Hawaii News&&&Bases on the moon? Haven't we gotten over that myth of a possibility yet? Try cleaning up the messes we've made here on earth first and preventing future degradation. Maybe then, we'll deserve to look to other planets. Always trying to get to the moon smacks of the attitude that we can trash where we live until it's dead, then just leave it for somewhere else. Or, maybe we just can't shake the desire to colonize or own something that doesn't belong to us. How much does this ad-venture cost us every year? While we've had a few good inventions come out of the space program, we could have been inventing them with or without it. The rest of the NASA budget and the fuel that goes into those trips to the moon are resources better applied somewhere else - like maybe the budget deficit and the goal to reduce fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emmissions worldwide?&&&2

Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Kelly (strike a balance) it is understandable that you are concerned for the future of your job just as many others are. However, the truth is sugar and pine companies have been subsidized for over 100 years and have never been fully stand alone. What are you suggesting we balance, business as usual against dwindling resources? HC&S, A&B, ML&P could be growing far less water demanding crops using integrated agroforestry systems that produce multiple layers of food and value-added products but they choose not to and haven't ever taken that challenge seriously (a few acres of coffee or organics doesn't count). If they did, you'd still get to keep your job, we'd be growing more foods for local consumption, and there would be more water for the streams; something essential for nearshore fisheries. You like eat fish, yeah? That's real balance.&&&2

Given that cavalier indifference from "Corporate Hawaii", fat chance so to speak, the LPGA sees anything close to the high six, low seven figure investments it needs to keep Hawaii on the tour... Too bad, really... The Turtle Bay event is first class, and great television for Golf Channel, showcasing the North Shore...

Don't kowtow to North Korea - Hawaii Editorials&&&Always the problem appears of the only nation to have used nuclear weapons on a civilian population and that has tens of thousands of nuclear warheads at the ready trying to dissuade another nation from following that path ... or from possessing a few such weapons and a six pack of missiles. This is not to say that the attempt is wrong, only that the inconsistency of the position undermines its moral thrust. The US tolerates Israel's possession of nukes, stands off from pressuring the French, seemingly tolerates India's small arsenal. China, Russia continue to own these weapons, too. It seems inevitable that they will continue to spread and highly probable that they will be detonated somewhere. The "ban the bomb" mothers in England look so quaint in the old newsreels of their protests in the 50's and early 60's. Too bad that the world's leaders did not eliminate these weapons before the threat spread so far and so quickly. Iran, Japan may be next ... if these two sophisticated nations do not already have them. The future is treacherous indeed where this matter is concerned; it is unlikely to be resolved by "do as I say, not as I do" approaches.&&&13
N. Korean missile watch on - Hawaii News&&&Folks, remember that it was under our President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, who saw these kinds of threats so long ago, initiating our Star Wars missile shield defense program. The granola eaters and peace-niks talked stink about him back then, but look, see how Reagan got us up and started with our missile intercepting capability protecting YOU in Hawaii? Heard NK chickened-out and their boat that was headed to Mynamar, turned-around. Tyrants will always cave when their bluff is called because their psychology is based on their projection of fear being rewarded. When that fails and you stand up to them, they cave. Kim Jong Il is afraid his own People will get to him and his sons, that is why he has rivals and dissidents dissapeared, jailed, tortured and murdered. HE GOT TWO OF OUR AMERICANS---LADIES, NO LESS---IN HIS PRISONS RIGHT NOW. God Bless Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Cannot wait for them attack us, we should take them out first and soon.&&&19

What I do recall is that Mufi's stooges refused to accept a petition legally signed by thousands of Oahu residents to put such a question on the ballot. Instead we were treated to a non question along the lines of "Should Mufi's totally awesome train be red or blue?" Would you support a "yes/no" rail vote?&&&16

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Ref: "Rise up to stop the tax madness," by K. Nolda. Sorry, but I don't see that happening. You must understand that if our elected officials didn't kotow to unions and special interest, instead of their constitutens, what would the constitutents have to complain about? Much like several years ago when the City and SHOPO gridlocked on police raises. It went to arbitration. The arbitrator agreed with the union and our City Council voted to increase the weight tax on registered vehicles. One Council member actually stated publicly that the raise in weight taxes was to pay for these raises. But don't police provide service and protection to all people of Oahu, not just registered owners? But alas, nothing was done by registered car owners. No outcry. No protest. No nothing.&&&11

Newswatch - Newswatch&&&Whats wrong with Pele? Why is she acting up and what is the reason for her tantrum? We know she tiring of Kilauea and has begun moving away from the Big Island. Evidence of this is her eruption that is flowing into the ocean. Her offshore retreat Loihi is being prepared slowly off the southeast coast and is underwater but slowly rising. My Tutukane told me that she is not one to anger for she will retaliate with a vegence. That story of her sister from Tahiti who banished her to the Big Island has always made Pele feel confined. With her move into the ocean and then to biuld Loihi she has finally decided its time to move. Her direction towards the Mainlands West coast shows that she wants a different place to reside. Just maybe her temper suggest she has tired of the bickering and fighting amongst us in Hawaii. Afterall we have been changing Hawaii with too many tall buildings and polluting our ocean enviroment for to long.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Intestines on GMO. Corporate Greed is Good!**lol** "...This reprogramming can cause the intestinal flora to begin reproducing Bt pesticides,..." Many doctors are warning their patients to avoid GMOs as well, recognizing the distinct correlation between GMOs and disease. Ohio allergist Dr. John Boyles believes genetically engineered foods are so dangerous that people should never eat them. Biologist Pushpa M. Bhargava, following the review of more than 600 scientific journals, has concluded that the drastic deterioration of Americans' health in recent years can be attributed to GMOs being introduced into their diets. Experimental studies of genetically engineered foods and their effects in the body are disturbing, to say the least. Biologist David Schubert of the Salk Institute has stated that children are the most likely people to experience the adverse effects of GMOs, noting that apart from adequate safety studies, children become "the experimental animals". In truth, every citizen is a guinea pig when genetically altered organisms are introduced into the food supply without adequate safety studies let alone honest labeling. In the animal studies that have been conducted, some noteworthy findings have been discovered about GMOs: Female rats fed genetically modified soy saw most of their babies die within three weeks compared to the 10% death rate experienced by rats fed natural soy. The babies that survived in the genetically modified- fed control group were also born smaller and had problems getting pregnant later on. Male rats fed genetically modified soy experienced a change in testicular color from pink to dark blue, as well as altered young sperm and significant changes in their DNA. Indian buffalo that consumed genetically modified cottonseed experienced various birthing complications including infertility, abortions, premature delivery, and prolapsed uteruses. Many of the calves that survived birth died shortly thereafter. In the United States, about 24 farmers reported that their pigs became sterile after consuming genetically modified corn. Genetically modified corn and cotton, purposely engineered to create their own built-in pesticide called Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), have been indicted in several studies to provoke intense allergic and immune reactions and death. Since the levels of Bt produced in the plant represent thousands of times more a concentration of Bt than natural Bt spray, the effects are greatly amplified. Shepherds whose sheep grazed on Bt cotton after harvest witnessed thousands of their sheep die. Post mortem examinations revealed severe irritation and black patches in the intestines and liver, as well as enlarged bile ducts. All sheep fed the Bt cotton eventually died within 30 days while those that grazed on natural cotton remained healthy. Bt corn was also responsible for the deaths of cows, horses, water buffaloes, and chicken in both Germany and the Philippines. Genetically modified tomatoes fed to rats were shown to cause bleeding stomachs and eventually killed many of the rats. These are just a few examples of the many catastrophic effects of using genetically modified organisms as food. Probably the worst finding in the AAEM report is the fact that GMOs can live and reproduce in the intestinal flora of the body long after being eaten. The genes present in the genetically modified organisms transfer into the DNA of intestinal bacteria, the good bacteria that digests food and maintains bodily health. This reprogramming can cause the intestinal flora to begin reproducing Bt pesticides, for example, rather than producing the living bacteria it is supposed to. The permanent, deadly implications of these alterations are mind boggling since intestinal flora is crucial for life.&&&7

Big Isle filmmaker resists demand to turn over video - Hawaii News&&&Seems that Alvarez is not a journalist after all, and therefore falls outside of the protection accorded or intended to be afforded by the shield law. However, because he produced one other documentary, let us suppose he is a journalist. By already providing at least one other defendant a portion of the video, he has opened the door, and waived any privilege, real or imagined, to prevent him from turning over that video. The question arises as to whether he can invoke the shield law to conceal the balance of the video. The mere attempt to do so, suggests that Alvarez' move is not intended to protect sources, but to hinder a full display of the evidence the Plaintiff is entitled to as a matter of plain discovery. That tool, in turn, is to provide the Court itself ALL relevant evidence upon which to consider and arrive at a thoughtful decision. In other words, Alavarez' position to conceal the balance of the video is to deprive the Court of its historical role to consider ALL the evidence. This attempt to misuse the shield law, reveals that Alvarez' position is one of weakness. Beyond that, the shield law was intended to protect sources, not, as here, to conceal the identity of others involved in delaying construction. Alvarez' position to not turn over the balance of the video is guised as protecting sources, when in fact, it is a move to conceal the identity of co-conspirators who participated in an alleged illegal activity on his land. As a side note, the kapu system was overthrown in 1819, following the death of Kamehameha I. To resurrect that system is to disrespect the kupuna who decided to overthrow that system. They knew better then as to why that decision was made, as compared to modern day types far removed from the harsh reality of former times when that decision was made. To be sure, there is law regarding the disinterment of remains, and Brescia should be made to comply with such law as well.&&&10

Akaka Bill defines native Hawaiian broadly - Kokua Line&&&That's just great. 1/64th part, and you are suddenly a member of a make believe Indian tribe, huh? That rationale behind the Akaka bill limitation to 1/64th part-Hawaiians is flawed. 1893? The year of the overthrow of a government that did not limit citizenship to 1/64th part-Hawaiians, but instead the monarchy had non-Hawaiian subjects, but yet the Akaka bill is going to exclude their descendants? Just like the Rice case, and the recent ceded land case, OHA losing both cases, this Akaka bill, for anybody honest enough, is just OHA trying to go national and that effort too will suffer the weight of a certain decision by the US Supreme Court. Who cares really, except that the Akaka bill seeks to seize the Hawaiian home lands and the share of the ceded 5(f) lands and revenue, stick it in the Akaka bill, and give it to the mini-maoles now running the OHA and kam school shows----to the detriment of the REAL native Hawaiians sought to be treated under the HHCA, 1920. The Akaka bill is based on the Monarchy. The HHCA and 5(f) is the US remediating the negative effects of the corrupt Monarchy dispossessing the common native Hawaiian tenants since the Mahele of 1848. Diametrically opposed, ideological enemies.&&&3

Lingle tells workers to expect layoffs; their unions come back ...&&&This law suit will costs in the millions and will be detrimental on both sides. Only the lawyers will benefit from this. This is hard times and seems like everyone is only looking out for themselves and don't care who gets laid off in the long run. Governor Lingle said it's only temporary until the economy picks up but the union doesn't want to hear any excuses. It's members will only be shooting themselves on the foot when lay offs comes.&&&456

Motion to block furloughs to be heard in court July 2 - Hawaii ...&&&This action by state workers wipes out any sympathy I had for them. Literally tens of thousands of private sector employees have lost their jobs due to the recession, and tens of thousands more have had their hours cut. These are business necessities. Unfortunate but necessary. State workers' inability to recognize and deal with business necessities reflects poorly on intellect and character of state workers. I am now convinced, having never had an opinion on this matter before, that state government workers have betrayed the public's trust and acted irresponsibly with taxpayers' money all along. At this stage, furloughs seem like a gift. Layoffs now seem like a much better solution: they'll achieve the same budget-balancing result, plus there will be the added benefit of permanently removing workers who have betrayed the public's trust.&&&88
Isle team finds loss of smell is Parkinson's sign&&&I started losing my sesne of smell about 5 - 7 years ago. Guess what, I have now been diagnosed with Parkinson's.

Even after I told them I had a tremor in my finger they did not express any concern or make a connection to parkinson's.&&&1
Bill to repatriate homeless advances - Hawaii News&&&Finally a bill that makes sense. All these mainland states send their homeless here so that they don't have to pay for them. We're one of the smallest states and one of the MOST EXPENSIVE STATES! But the fact that Hawaii makes it so easy for other states to tell their homeless, if you go to Hawaii you can get on welfare within 2 hours after you land. So I hope Rida Cabanilla addresses that issue too. Don't make it so easy to get on welfare here. We have enough of our own local-born people who refuse to get off of welfare. For crying out loud we even have people who were Katrina survivors who were sent here. Send them back to let their own states to take care of them. As for all the nay sayers, BE QUIET. I'd rather my taxes be used to improve our schools.&&&8

Jon Riki Karamatsu Drunk Driving&&&Does anyone know if the Hawaii State House of Representatives actually did anything to censure Jon Karamatsu for his drunk driving incident where he was excessively drunk, took out a concrete barrier, and blamed it on car problems? Is all forgiven because he "voluntarily" stepped down from the Vice Speaker position? Does anyone know how the community feels about him now? The guy could have killed one of us and I hope people don't forget that.&&&27
Brief asides - SB Editorials&&&Last year, I wondered why I stopped receiving jokes from a regular emailer so I asked if she was mad at me. She admitted she was. Why? Because I sent back links from to refute some of her forwards. She added that a relative of hers asked why I always checked snopes..."It's as if she doesn't trust you?" the relative remarked. Consequently, even though I know a forward from her is a lie, I simply delete it and go on with my life. Some people choose to live ignorant lives.&&&1

Tough yards you could count on - Hawaii Sports&&&This is a reminder that Hawaii has had success with the running game. Guys like Heikoti and Travis, as you have named in this series. June Jones took that away with his single-minded intent on proving you can win with a one-dimensional offense. He often said that he wanted a complete game without a single rushing down. He proved that. But he also took away one of the joys of football, the rushing game. It is the most single exciting event in football to see a great running back dominate the game. Travis Sims came real close to doing that. So did Heikoti Fakava.&&&15
Unity of government said to be key in crisis - Hawaii News&&&I love how these politicians say WE will get through these tough times. The state legislature gave themselves a 36% raise for a part time job many of them go to less than 50% of the time and Lingle got a 15% raise herself. So much for THEIR tough economic times. When do you suppose was the last time Ms. Lingle was worried about paying her bills? These hypocrits give themselves huge raises, then tell state workers sorry but there is no money to pay you. What a joke. Unfortunately, the people of Hawaii keep on electing the same self surving people into office. Hawaii, please remember all those elected officials who serve no one but themselves and vote for anybody running against them. A new state legislature and governor would be the start of a better Hawaii.&&&2

Homeless Evicted from Depots Beach&&&I saw this on the Honolulu Star Bulletin web news dated Jun 30. I agree that the beaches and other public areas need to be cleaned up. Kudos to the officials. What is not being addressed is that the evicted will just move elsewhere. It is unacceptable for them to live on the beach or in other public areas, but at the same time a program needs to be put in place to help each group that is evicted from their encampments.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Elise Heck writes "While we all have tremendous respect for the services and goods that our government workers provide, what they a and more importantly, their leadership a need is a dose of reality". I could encourage government workers to come out to the private sector where workers are denied a fair wage to cover the cost of survival while their management is paid an enormous salary to eliminate jobs and steal benefits from their employees. Having a union presents the only means to balance the playing field for some whose bosses pretend to care about them while robbing the company blind. I would love to spend my union dues on my family but until I am treated fairly I have no choice but to fight for what is mine. The only chance I have to obtain a contract that covers cost of living is through negotiations from my union. My boss gave himself a 40% raise and offers 1% to all employees who are willing to give something up in exchange. He forces his crazy decisions on uniforms, policies and procedures, and anything he fees like messing up on a team of employees who have been doing the job for almost a century. While he pretends to recognize his employees for their contribution to the team, he refuses to sign contracts (with them) because it benefits him. Soon he will wonder why we no longer work as a team.&&&14
The world smiles back - Hawaii Features&&&So do people cancel subscriptions on good-news days and begin subscriptions on bad-news days? Actually, the Star-Bulletin does a much better job at reporting good news than the local Fox TV station, the first half of whose 6:00 pm newscast seems to be all the bad news that it can squeeze in, and then some.

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Department of Education is overstaffed. Did the State of Hawaii investigate the unnecessary staffing by the Department of Education. It appears there are too many administrators and too many people working at the public school offices. If one goes into the school offices during the working hours, you will typically find workers on the internet, reading the paper and talking story. The bottom line is instead of cutting the teachers that really work hard for their money, the Department of Education should eliminate the "district offices" and centralize all the administrators into one location. They should also eliminate the administrative positions that are duplicative.&&&7
Athletics likely another casualty of budget cuts - Hawaii News&&&That's it Pat and the BOE. Let's cut the number of school days. Let's cut teaching positions. Heck, let's cut athletics, but for goodness sake, let's don't touch the "fat" at the DOE. Let's just keep all those deputies, the substitue clericals and custodians. What about the $2.2 MILLION dollars for sabbatical leaves, which typically last about 6 months and could be termed "taxpayer-funded breaks." Maybe the voters should ask themselves if their money should continue paying educators NOT to be in school.&&&104

Job-linked insurance not best coverage - Business News&&&So it seems that the State legislators messed up once again when they mandated health insurance for all workers working 20 or more hours per week. The employers' CPAs probably suggested that they could reduce their health care costs by hiring more part time workers for 19 hours per week. The legislators caused more harm in their effort to help workers with health insurance. I don't know why CPAs would be the ones suggesting ways to save money when you would think it would be lawyers advising the employers to do so. I guess the CPAs are already hired by the employers while hiring an attorney to suggest things just cost the employer more money. I guess if you double the number of workers by having 2 workers doing the work of 1 full time worker, the CPAs can charge more for doing the employers' payrolls.&&&2

Brief asides - SB Editorials&&&Why no report on the so called "climate change" bill the both of Hawaii's Representatives voted for? This "energy" bill will only make the economic hardship this state is experiencing even worse. How is most of the energy this state uses created...fossil fuels. Would it be great to use some other form, sure. Is there another form that is cost effective and of such quantity that it could sustain the economy, not at this time. This large bill that almost no one who voted for it has completely read is nothing more that a consolidation of power in the Federal government. Its a tax to change behavior. It'll change behavior all right. It'll send jobs and industry to other countries. America lead the way in in carbon-reduction! Who'll bet a month's pay that Russia, China, and North Korea come to the realization that they need to follow our lead? Anyone? Fat chance. This type of "cap and trade" has not worked anywhere. In fact, most of the European countries that adopted these policies are running away from them as fast as they can because they've killed their economies. Let's hope the Senate will take more time and actually read the bill and see it for what it is and what it will do.&&&1

Newswatch - Newswatch&&&Within the last 1 ,000 years Haleakala had numerous eruptions on its slopes. When we have a earthquake on these slopes it can signify a upcoming eruption. If we look at the history of these beautiful island evidence of volcanic activity is everywhere. Just look at the national landmark Diamond Head, or Punchbowl crater. 10,000 years ago our lanscaped was in constant change and Oahu had such activity then. The god Maui is said to have built Haleakala to slow the sun over his domain. The glow of Kilauea is what steered our ancestors here from the ocean 1400 hundered years ago. Amazing!Lets hope its just a earthquake and not any signs of a eruption so the people of Maui will be safe.&&&2
Poll refutes Gay Marriage&&&May 27, 2009 Majority of Americans Continue to Oppose Gay MarriageNo change in support from last yearby Jeffrey M.

Though support for legal same-sex marriage is significantly higher now than when Gallup first asked about it in 1996, in recent years support has appeared to stall, peaking at 46% in 2007.&&&2
Sick Gay Pedophiles&&&SICK Gay Pedophile Perverts Frank Lombard is the associate director of Dukes Center for Health Policy. The university administrator was recently arrested by the FBI and charged with offering up his adopted 5-year-old son for sex. I tried to contact Frank Lombard over the weekend to probe his expertise regarding the health benefits of raping small children. So far, hes declined to comment. University administrator Lombard is accused of logging on to a chat room online and describing himself as a perv dad for fun. The detective who wisely looked into the suspicious screen name says that Lombard admitted to molesting his own adopted son. All this was before allegedly inviting a stranger to travel to North Carolina from another state to statutorily rape his already-molested adopted son.&&&1
Pentagon clarifies North Korean missile threat to Hawaii, Alaska&&&The government of your nation will not panic it's people who they cannot save anyway if your hometown became the target for an intercontinental ballistics missile.

One minute, your minding your own business, doing your own thing. And if you are not a spiritually born again christian, when your present location becomes "Ground Zero", in only a billionth of a second you will suddenly wonder how you got into Hell so quick. You will not even know what happened back there on that place called Earth. Think of how many people that has already happened to in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagisaki in the year of 1945. Don't make the mistake of thinking it cannot happen to anyone on this planet in this day and time. If I were the victom of a nuclear strike, I'd rather wonder how I got into Heaven so quick than wonder how I got into Hell so quick.&&&11

Rush Limbaugh is the poster child of using the Web as a pulpit from which to spread lies and stir up hatred. The good news is, Limbaugh's lies were believed by only the extreme right-wing, which is statistically insignificant, as it always will be. The halo effect of Limbaugh's right-wing demagogery alienated mainstream Americans last election season, resulting of a complete rout of candidates endorsed by Limbaugh.&&&22

What is totally nauseating is the adoration of this "person" by the tens of millions of people, half of whom weren't even born when he was at his peak. For God's sake, give it a rest. He was just a human being, and not a very good example of one at that.&&&14
Anonymity on the Web spawns the outrageous - Columnists&&&Ms. Oi, I note a glaring omission in your column. I didn't see any reference to Ed Schultz, Keith Olberman, or Rachel Maddow. I think their stretching of the truth and outright lies are sometimes, sometimes, worse than Rush Limbaugh. There are always two sides to every story. How about presenting them as a matter of courtesy. In response to your mentioning people posting without signing their real name. Consider this - Several years ago, during the 2004 campaign, I submitted a Letter to the Editor with my opinion of one of the candidates. I signed my given and surnames. Within hours after its publication I had received two obscene and threatening phone calls from people, who didn't identify themselves. Freedom of speech under attack, wouldn't you say? I didn't intendto put my family in jeopardy by voicing my own personal opinion so I now just sign all my posts as shown above. If you really need to know my identity, provide me with your home phone number and I'll call. Aloha.&&&3

Letters to the editor - Letters&&&Kelly: I think the "King of Pop" was a rip off of Elvis's "The King". MJ lost me around the time of "Thriller". His plastic surgeries, molestation charges, surrogate children, sleep-overs with 10 year olds, courtroom appearences in pajamas, "Neverland", "Peter Pan" complex, he lived in his own world. His weight at 125# and the prescription drugs says it all. No way could his frail and sickly condidtion allow for 50 concerts next year. And $500. million in debt? His "handlers" enabled him like Elvis and Anna Smith. Sad waste of talent, but no "Sainthood".&&&10

Schools should tap into Hurricane Relief Fund - Hawaii Editorials&&&It should be OK for the DOE to tap into the Hurricane Relief Fund, just as long as the DOE pays back the money to the fund with interest, and just as long as it's OK for the Hurricane Relief Fund to raid the DOE's coffers if the Hurricane Relief Fund falls short and needs a cash infusion.&&&32
Cultures intersect in Budapest - Travel&&&Your account of Budapest is riddled with errors. Hungarians did not "beat back" the Turks. The Ottoman Empire lost control of this region after battling combined Habsburg, German and Polish forces. Nor did Hungary "beat back" the Austrians. They considered and consider it their golden age to have been allied with Austria and the alliance ended because together they tried to burn, rape and pillage all of Europe in World War I and failed. Hungary didn't "beat back" the Russians either. Hungarians were living peacefully with them, and then they left on their own accord. Hungary has occupied most of the neighbors and, having lost these lands, still makes embarrassingly disturbing overtures to wanting these territories back -- some 15% of the Hungarian population speaks about this openly today even though several of these countries are now together in the EU with Hungary, with the result that the neighbors are frightened of Hungary even today. Or what about this: "Walk down any given street and you'll see 13th-century Hungarian royal palaces..." Excuse me? How many girls did they give you to write this tripe. It just isn't true. There is a remnant of a basement of a Castle in Budapest purported to date from back then. Please try to control your stories to conform to standards of journalistic editing in future.&&&1

Measure of victory will be how little is lost - On Politics&&&HGEA runs the great risk of alienating even the most staunch private sector supporters if they insist on maintaining the status quo. Everyone I know has been hit in the pocketbook by this international fiscal crisis with no end in sight. It' probably more complicated than this, but it would seem to me that the unions should be working to see proportional wage cuts for all state employees in order to keep all of their members working with their benefits intact, health insurance being one of the most important. What happened to all for "one and one for all"? Or was that the Three Musketeers? as it is, they appear to be pulling a power play with the rest of us left to pay the freight. HGEA's current position may cost their members dearly in the long run.&&&1
Gubernatorial fundraising in full swing - Hawaii News&&&OMG!! Do we really need a 71 yr. old Governor for this State.

We have seen the evidence of a staged 9-11, what will stop the US government from allowing a few hundred thousand Hawaii residents to become toast as a justification to take out North Korea? Be wary my fellow islanders!&&&180
Lingle signs trio of alternative-energy bills into law - Hawaii...&&&Regarding HB1464. Hopefully the bill has a provision to protect consumers. The cost to consumers for the energy generated from renewable resources should not exceed that energy generated from non-renewable resources. In other words, it shouldn't be renewable at any cost. There's a lot of that "renewable at any cost" going on around the country, all in an effort to be going green but not using well thought out plans.&&&2
Schools consider slicing 13 days from class schedule - Hawaii News&&&normally I would be cheering with glee right now, except that my school already has to release seniors 15 days early because we cant hold graduation in aloha stadium as usual (only place that can fit us all), but not complaining about that. What I am complaining about: So the tally right now is: one less week of break for a week longer summer, increased school lunch prices, constant threats of closing down small schools in order to save money and pack the big schools with more students, releasing us 13 more days early, and did I mention my history book is older than me? I go to one of the best public schools in the state. And if I am complaining, imagine how conditions are at the worse schools. No wonder many opt for private school. My one request: when we score badly on tests, stop punishing students with more tests and scolding, and even calling some stupid. Obviously there are some factors affecting our class time and educational quality that are out of our control.&&&45

Suspect in peacock killing has defenders - Hawaii News&&&Peacocks are not an indigenous species and, considering the damage they do to rooftops and vehicles, they may be described as pests. Along with fighting chickens, they certainly ruin many neighborhoods with their incessant noise even while they do have their supporters among people who seem not to understand the merits of peace and quiet. this article will undoubtedly inspire posts defending the peacocks as if these invasive birds were native, or somehow traditional. They are neither but seem to have been adopted by the noise loving who tolerate and even defend barking dogs, boom cars, fireworks, low flying helicopters, modified mufflers, and all the other ear and nerve shattering elements of Oahu ... which has become a noisy, chaotic urban mess.&&&242

Sailing Pacific is fun, but Oahu's always home - Hawaii News&&&Hi Susan: I pass your articles on to my brother-in-law, who was stationed on Oahu during WW2 with the CeeBees. He's in his 80's but still has memories of Hawaii and of Australia, where he moved with his family in the later 60's. They lived on Bribie Island, near Brisbane. I sent him the article about the jelly fish and this is his remembrance. IT WAS GOOD TO READ HER REPORT. I LIKED THE PART ABOUT THE JELLY FISH. WE HAD LOTS OF THOSE SHOW UP ON BRIBIE EVERY YEAR. YOU SELDOM SAW ANY OTHER KIND. SOME TIME THEY WERE SO THICK YOU FELT YOU COULD WALK ACROSS THE WATER ON THEM. THE CHANNEL WAS FULL OF THEM DURING ONE OF THE LOCAL SCHOOL SAIL CLUB DAYS THAT I RAN. ONE GIRL'S BOAT FLIPPED OVER OUT IN MID CHANNEL AND THEY WERE BOUNCING OFF HER LEGS AS SHE CLUNG TO THE BOAT LAYING ON IT'S SIDE. WE PULLED HER INTO THE PICK UP BOAT AND SHE KEPT YELLING "MY LEGS ARE STINGING". KEN GAVE HER A TOWEL TO WRAP HER SELF IN AS WE RIGHTED HER BOAT AND TOWED IT BACK TO THE RAMP. WHEN WE GOT THERE KEN TIPPED HER BOAT UP AND DUMPED THE WATER OUT AS I TALKED TO TO HER. I ASKED HER TO SHOW ME WHERE THE JELLY FISH HAD STUNG HER. AS SHE LOOK ALL OVER HER LEGS AND FOUND NOTHING. SHE STOPPED CRYING AND ASKED IF SHE COULD GO SAILING AGAIN. OUT SHE WENT AND WE ALL HAD A GOOD DAY.&&&1

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Gerald, your middle man would be big daddy gov't telling you what you could or could not get. It would no longer be your choice of treatment. Bad idea! Here's an example: "SAWYER: I want to ask about this, Mr. President, because you said to me when we talked yesterday that you think if everyone has the right information, that doctors will make the right decisions, patients will make the right decisions. And you just said we think we do know what is over-treatment. And Dr. John Corboy from Colorado, do we always know? And what if a patient comes to you and says, no, I want that extra CT-scan, I think I need that extra CT-scan, and you're at the risk of being sued,among other things, what are you going to do? DR. JOHN CORBOY, NEUROLOGIST & MEDICAL PROFESSOR: Well, I think you still have to provide the appropriate care. And I think we all know that there is a significant amount of care that actually is inappropriate and unnecessary. And the question then is -- for you, Mr. President, is, what can you convince -- what can you do to convince the American public that there actually are limits to what we can pay for with our American health care system? And if there are going to be limits, who is going to design the system and who is going to enforce the rules for a system like that?" Cost is a problem...gov't will ultimately drive cost down so much that the private sector will not be able to compete. Unfair and un-American, but it all leads to socialized care no matter what bow and ribbon you put on it. All the while keep in mind that the gov't will dictate what care you can get and what tests they deem are necessary. Not a good idea. There will be no second opinions as I said, gov't will run out the private sector and you all will be stuck. Another concern the President metnioned was patient education. For those that work with patients, you know that patient compliance is a monumental problem.(taking their meds, advice, and suggestions from medical teams...big problem) An example: Look at how much info is out there about smoking and obesity's detrimental health effects....have you seen many changes in people's choices for behavior change? No, because you cannot force YOUR will on the people no matter how much education you throw at them!!&&&9
How Many of Hawaii's People Care For A Chinese King?&&&How many of Hawaii's people care for a Chinese king and should they? Will And Last Testament Of HIM Yao Sui Posted on Jun 23rd, 2009 by himyaosui : Officially Emperor of China While this may not be a legal Will, I am without any money. Yet, I do hope that my Will (wishes) will be carried out. I have two adopted sons, who live on the East Coast. Both are graduates of Princeton University and both are of adult age. The eldest son, from memory, is in his 30s or 40s and like Dr. Kissinger a mathematician and it is to this son that I grant my succession. I am without legal heirs. I have no natural children. I am in a position similar to Abraham, where I am father of a nation. As a true and great Chinese king, it would be irresponsible of me to not name a successor. The older person, myself, at the age of 60 has gained insight as to this world and as to what is needed to fill my heritage shoes. I can not, therefore, grant this heritage to someone who is not qualified to lead a nation nor can I leave this succession to someone who is truly blind to the true god, Jehovah. I stand firmly against wicked and evil practices. Against Satanic practices like channeling, which some people do not realize that they are doing. In so far as I know my choice is a decent one and man is not perfect where man can always have a beautiful front and do all of the right things. We make the best available choices, at the time, based on all we know. When you ask a loved one to come to God and they refuse, when you ask a loved one not to practice evil practices and they refuse, how can you grant something such as a symbolic Hebrew heritage to such a person. God does not choose stupid people. God is a god of intelligence and, yes, someone dedicated to God would fill the bill in God's eyes, but many have exhibit a god-less naiveté and foolishness which comes from a disloyalty to God that I can not recommend them or chose them to fill my shoes. If I should survive and have natural heirs, I shall train these boys in the way of the lord and they shall inherit the heritage. If not then it is my first son (by the Chinese custom practiced in my family structure, legally adopted) who shall inherit my mandate. The boy (man) is logical and mathematically oriented such was Henry Kissinger and Paul Wolfowitz. Very bright, intelligent, and soft-spoken men. Well-qualified for any high-level task set before them. And, therefore, such is my choosing. I pray that it is Jehovah who will oversee my present and temporary choice for a successor and that family members shall not fight over these things. /ss/ HIM Yao Sui 06-23-2009&&&7
Jackson's death spurs reminder about need for cardiac training ...&&&The autopsy hasn't even been started and you're already calling for a "need for cardiac training"?

Schools should tap into Hurricane Relief Fund - Guest Editorials&&&I thought I wrote something earlier but OK Janis have it your way. You have your hand out which is almost as typical as a shaka sign. If you want a slice of the people's money that was taken for a specific purpose only to be diverted to your special purpose, take the money. The only stipulation is that you and every person working for the BOE needs to pledge their property, savings, pensions and investments as collateral to make sure that the money comes back to the taxpayers. Put some skin in the game will ya? Rather than find ways to soak up money, spend some time finding ways to become more efficient. I can understand that by bringing in 'outsiders' many of you will lose jobs and have to think differently which is unheard of in your institution of learning. P.S. if a hurricane does hit us, will you be there to put up a tarp on my roof?&&&6

If the nation of CHina was an atheist nation, where 1.3 billion Chinese did not know God, would you as a Christian help an effort to bring God and convert the whole of China in a Christian effort to save lives? How about the people from New Hope, whom I spoke to, would they be willing to do this or to give of their time and of themselves 1 to 4 hours a month?

Isle visitor arrivals continue downward - Hawaii Business&&&Giving value to visitors is the key to survival in this horrible economy. At Makani Catamaran, we considered trying to abate the increase in our costs by cutting some food and beverage items from our daily sails from the increasingly expensive Kewalo Basin. We decided against that approach as being short-sighted. As a result, our numbers are up over last year. Value must be the byword for all tourist dependant businesses.&&&28
Superferry urged not to abandon 2 vessels - Hawaii Business&&&Worst thing that almost happened to Hawaii in the worst way. The governor and everyone associated with the company should be ashamed and banished from the isles for blatantly circumventing environmental protections. Next best thing to happen to Hawaii since KSBE trust was removed from power. Hawaii needs new leadership.

Home sales in West jumped 9% during May - Hawaii Business&&&When prices here in Hawai`i slip below what they were seven years ago, then we'll be able to buy. A house not 500 feet from us sold in 2001 (before 9/11) for $175,000. Two years ago, it sold again for $775,000. Now it's in foreclosure and on the market for $500,000. Other than a paint job and some new appliances, there've been no improvements. Why should any house cost so much in what is essentially a 50 year old lower-middle-class neighborhood in Kailua? We still rent because the maximum mortgage we can pay is on a $200,000 house, but there's no such thing anymore.&&&6
Shipping talks continue into overtime - Hawaii News&&&This is not the time for the union to ask for pay increase and benefits. while many people are looking at reduced pay or layoffs, the unions is flexing their muscles due to its perceived strength in disruption of business and economic burden for Hawaii's economy. There is Horizon ship line that does the same type of business and Pasco who does mainly car transportation between the main land and Hawaii. We need to open up the competition level for ocean transport in Hawaii so that if the any union wanting to strike it would let competition determine wages of the workers. Unions were once a viable part in the past to help workers who were abused by employers but now it is mostly run by greedy people who only want to grab every opportunity to help their own pocket book.&&&30
Letters to the editor - Letters&&&-Agreed Ms. Catherine Robbins, any new developments belong in Chile. Those ghastly white domes are visible all the way down to Puna, and the paltry one dollar per annum usage fee for this conservation area of public trust ceded lands has apparently been outstanding for the last thirty years. Those vocal flotsam and jetsam resident astronomers in Kamuela affecting their ubiquitous baseball caps and trophy wives are little more than an assemblage of fatuous arrogant drones. Let them instead paint those domes an environmentally friendly green or camouflaged netting placed thereon ideally pilfered from the occupational military. Ambient air temperatures and thermal gradients are of little consequence to those bigoted old curmudgeons employed therein as opposed to the unspoiled scenic public viewing vantages of the sacred mountain.&&&24

Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&re: campaign donations Only the wealthiest of private citizens have the wherewithall to donate $2000-$6000 to an individual. Unions and corporations on the other hand can make donations of this size to multiple individuals. The courts have opened the doors of our legislature to the unions and corporations and in essence shut out the public. What a mistake. Hopefully, this will be appealed to the state supreme court. I don't have much hope that they will reverse this decision but it's the only hope we have since the legislature won't attempt to fix the problem. I bet those bums are already doing some quick calculating to figure out how much they can collect for their next campaign.&&&1

Furloughs are better than possible layoffs - Hawaii Editorials&&&3 day a month furloughs are better for whom? Furloughs will further reduce state tax revenues due to the loss in revenue from state worker pay in the form of income tax as well as the multiplier effect of the GET. This further loss of revenue will prolong local economic recovery which may result in additional furlough days in order to balance budget shortfalls in future years. Forloughs coupled with the 29% increase in health insurance premiums and the refusal of the employer to pay it's full share will undoubtedly cause many state workers to forgo health insurance and/or place their children on Medicaid. This is already happening and will undoubtedly increase when new plans are introduced and open enrollment finally takes place in a few months. Your editorial's allegation that backlogs can be made up later is absurd especially as regards the courts. What happened to the defendents right to a speedy trial? Perhaps the Governor believes they (who by the way are innocent until proven guilty), like the public workers who work in the prisons or defend them, have no rights in an economic crisis. Furloughs have been proposed for 2 years and it is highly unlikely that the Governor will reduce or eliminate them during her remainingg term which will only increase the backlog in the courts and elsewhere such as the Bureau of Conveyance, eligibility for benefits, health centers and hospital, etc. The Governor's contention that she will hire additional workers with the savings realized from the furloughs is counterintuitive? More employees mean payment of more in benefits for the same work. Or is she proposing to hire the new employees on 89-day emergency contracts with no benefits to be repeatedly renewed until the "emergency" is over? There are workers who retired years ago who have been on 89-day contracts since because the employer has never bothered to hire a real replacement. That's pure and simply bad management. Finally, the Governor has selective amnesia as regards the complaint filed in Circuit Court by 4 unions. This "Complaint" requested 4 things - 1) a determination that the Governor does not have the right to furlough under the State Constitution, 2) a preliminary injunction to immediately stop the furloughs, 3) a permanent injunction as regards the furloughs, and 4) the payment of all fees incurred by the unions. In her press conference, the Governor alleged that no complaint requesting an injunction had been filed. Her legal advisors either provided her with misinformation or she is choosing, once again, to speak half-truths. She's all smoke and mirrors and in this case, is actually lying to the public in order to win their support in this labor dispute. This has been her style throught her administration. She leads with a sucker punch in order to knock out the opponent. In tis case, she is the one who is going to end up on the wrong side of a TKO. The unions and their members will go to the mat in an effort to force the employer to make good on the collective bargaining law. And they will prevail because it is the law.&&&123

Port Royal officer escapes court-martial - Hawaii News&&&Sorry to say, that skipper is the scapegoat. He was just following orders. Do they know which coral was damaged at that time? Maybe it was from the construction, or the heavy waves during high tide or during storms. Or even a dozen things. The oil tankers come and go right in that area all the time. Again, some of the dumbest things come out of the very people that are suppose to be in charge. Give it up. As for the state wanting to charge for the damage done, I am anxious to hear how they will decide which coral was damaged when. There are other boats and ships coming and going in that area. Then you have the heavy tides and violent waves during storms. Not to mention construction from the runway. We have other shores around these islands in much worse shape than there. It seems like the Navy has been working hard to access the damage and making repairs. Leave the collection for the damage alone. It is the right thing to do.&&&44
Islam Day&&&It looks like it is almost official. Hawaii will have a holiday: Islam Day, if Governor Linda Lingle signs the bill. Does anyone know why this bill was introduced?. A lot of us are upset.

Does anyone know why this bill was introduced and why the legislators are backing it? The Muslim community can't be that large in Hawaii. Please, lets not get racist and ugly with comments; we've all been hurt. But why this bill?&&&4

Mediator has unions, management bargaining - Hawaii News&&&If the Governor can't execute her plan to furlough state workers for 3 days/month or her last option of laying off workers is hampered by the Court, she may place the burden on the DOE and UH by decreasing their budgets even more by the costs associated with the furloughs or lay offs that she can't impose upon the 14,500 state workers under her direct control. But I guess, the unions will then take the matter to court saying that the state can't decide how much to spend on its own without union negotiation. I guess someone can't get sick without union approval.&&&170

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Janet Thebaud - "Health reform a clear necessity" Bull. First just because France (or anywhere else has it) does not mean WE have to have it or can afford it. If in fact they do reform it then I propose ANYONE showing up at a hospital for treatment either shows a valid insurance card or if a visitor from another country, a form stating their home country will cover their costs. If you can not provide either then it is cash on the barrelhead. There will be NO excuse for not having insurance if we do in fact decide to provide it at low cost (read another form of welfare). The country is already trillions in debt and you want to tack on a few trillion more? None of the "experts" can come with any kind of number for cost. Here is the deal, the US government already owns VA care. Have them fix THAT mess (they have complete control of it) then once they understand how complex the issue is come back with a proposal for national coverage. To heck with President Obama's "deadlines"...this is way to complex and important to fast track.&&&61

If the privatized companies workers decided to organize that is ok, next bid cycle that company will no longer be competitive.&&&7

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Janice, Great point made. By not telling the whole story, tells me, they are hiding a lot of information. For instance, only 3 men were waterboarded and the info we found out was incredible. But it wouldn't matter to them, unless it involved one of their family members being saved from a further attack. We have been safe, like you mentioned, but now, I doubt our safety will last as long this round. This administration is doing everything in it's power to tear this country apart and make us very vulnerable to the enemy and I think they will rue the day they decided to go down that path. Not to mention the sheep following. This whole thing, has to do with keeping us busy, while behind the scenes, they do what they do best.&&&1061

A Question For Hawaii Voters And For Other Interested People&&&A Question For Hawaii Voters And For Other Interested People - The Obama Presidency? posted at 6/24/2009 8:26 PM HDT HIMYAOSui First post: 6/18/2008 Last post: 6/24/2009 Total posts: 77 Question: Should President Barack Hussein Obama II in his first year in office meet with HIM Yao Sui, China's current succession Emperor, head of state in exile, the man who negotiated an end to the Iraq War between President George H.W. Bush and President Saddam Hussein in 1990? Background: During the South Caroline Democratic Party Presidential Debate held on July 23, 2007, Presidential candidate Barack Hussein Obama was asked if he would be willing to meet with America's worst and most dangerous enemies in an effort to bring or foster peace in the world. Stephen Sorta from Diamond Bar, California asked the following question: "Would you be willing to meet with leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea?" In 1982 Anwar Sadat traveled to Israel, a trip that has resulted in a peace agreement that has lasted ever since. In the spirit of that type of bold leadership would you be willing to meet, separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration in Washington DC or anywhere else, with leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries? Presidential candidate Barack Obama, strongly and emphatically, said that he would and his answer was recorded in the video below: Obama / Clinton on meeting anti-US leaders In view of the world's current situation, the possible continuation of the Iraq War inspite of our troops leaving on June 30, 2009, a possible and likely escalation of violence and the uprising of terrorist activities in the Middle East and around the world with our troop's pre-mature withdrawal (The current Obama plan), with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's threats made against the US and Israel, with North Korea selling arms to nations not friendly to US interest, and with North Korea having and selling nuclear weapons... would it be in our nation's best interest for President Barack Hussein Obama II meet with HIM Yao Sui, China's current succession Emperor, head of state of China? HIM Yao Sui is of Arab ancestry. A pre-Jewish Hebrew, whose family has lived in China for centuries. On his maternal side, HIM Yao Sui is a Mede and distantly related to Iran's current President. HIM Yao Sui is an American patriot and the negotiator of the Iraq War in 1990-91. SHOULD a meeting between these two men take place?

Hawaii needs China to corral North Korea - Hawaii Editorials&&&Yes very true. This time around Obama is trying to work more with all countries with in the region than to try to control North Korea lone. From past experience the U.S always jumped into this type of situation right a way on their own and that is no way to win friends with surrounding countries. Because of North Korea's mentality it's only a matter of time before a mistake will happen. A missile will fall down over Japan, South Korea or even who knows maybe inside China too? If a test goes bad within North Korea the wind just might carry the radiation straight over China and Russia then what? There is always that possibility. It seems like because Obama is not just automatically jumping right into the picture alone China has to consider what could happen if something goes wrong which it will go wrong in time for sure. As we know Russia and China was always on North Korea's side against the U.S. Yet this time around they have more to lose because of North Korea's way of thinking or lack of thinking might be a better word.&&&25

Massive starvation soon&&&The world agricultural production has passed it's peak, and it no longer can support the current rate of population growth in the world. Already in many countries in Africa, mass starvation is taking a deadly toll on little kids. In India, the recent introduction of pesticides to help with grain production, has caused a epidemic of genetic diseases amongst the children. People, unless agri-scientists can come up with another miracle revolution for grain production like they did in the 1950's which led to the current boom in food supplies, we are looking at the Mathulsin limiting factor in play, which states that human population can only grow as much as its food supply, which means a high likelyhood of a billion people dying from starvation within the next decade.&&&4

Union card check needs closer look - Hawaii Editorials&&&"Card check is no remedy. Darwin L.C. Ching, director of Hawaii's Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, correctly pointed out in testimony to legislators that in such a system "there is no way to determine whether a worker's signature was given freely and without intimidation, pressure or coercion from fellow employees, labor representatives, or the employer." How can anyone argue against this statement? "Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a former sponsor of the original "card check" legislation, has proposed a compromise allowing employees to send their cards or ballots to a third party to avert intimidation by labor or management. Other alternative proposals would require a "supermajority" of 60 percent or 67 percent for card certification and require a secret ballot at the request of at least one-third of workers." Sen. Feinstein's proposal sounds reasonable and will take the intimidation factor out but I doubt that the independent third party can always be found. Money talks and the independent third party could be bought with money, or be influenced by undisclosed ideology. The best way is for a secret ballot. There should be no compromise ... all balloting should be by secret ballot.&&&14

Measure of victory will be how little is lost - Hawaii Editorials&&&Well, that is one way to look at things. It is also possible that the public sector can accept the coming economic period as a time to re-think the structure and inefficiencies of unionized work that is basically a 1930's model designed to counter balance central control business models. In truth, if a clever and creative executive from the private sector were to take on the challenges facing the unions, we would see a far more effective work force and far better governance as a result. Don't be consumed by the whining. Change can be good for everyone ... except the dinosaurs, of course. Imua!&&&3

I've been on the Mainland for 1 1/2 years now, and wonder if they still have the above ground sewer line running down part of Kalianionaole?...Wouldn't it be nice if they just decided to fix a few potholes?&&&16
Liliha park repair hits 5 years and counting - Hawaii News&&&I am familiar with this area and the park. Criminals do congregate there. Ask HPD. They know drug deals go down and the graffiti made the restrooms hideous. You should see people hanging around the park even when the lights are out and it is past curfew. Spooky!Better to have NO Restroom area. Criminals liked the covered area. It costs less to maintain a mini park without restrooms. Then no place for criminal activity.&&&37
Walgreen net falls 9% as expenses increase - Hawaii Business&&&Walgreens is junk, Longs way better. Walgreens doesn't understand the local way and I'm surprised they profits didn't fall 90%. Hardly any sale items and nothing the locals want. Must be mainland guys in charge and no care about locals. Too expensive and junk stuff, just like a second hand store but real expensive. Walgreens just taking up valuable space, if they cannot serve the public then they should move on and let another business take the space.&&&4

I know, the analogy is not the same when comparing government workers with department store workers though. Yet in principal it's the same.&&&54

Governor Lingle's address - Hawaii News&&&So Lingle's plan to help the economy, take away money from one of the few classes of people who still have some to spend. yeah, real bright. I can tell you that as a public employee, I try to buy local whenever I can, regardless of the fact that it may cost more than the mainland "equivalent." That's going to have to be the first thing to go. The next, eating out at local restaurants. And ultimately, although I had planned for years to purchase my own home, that too will have to wait. Yeah Lingle, great way to improve the local economy. You were against tax hikes against the rich because you said that would slow economic growth, but what you are doing to the public employees is will do even more harm to the local economy. On top of that, you expect us public employees to carry out your plans to stimulate the economy through state project but now reduce the amount of time we can work to accomplish that. How a$$-backwards is that?&&&80

Maybe, if they are swamped with copies of this column, they will give some thought to reversing some of the many anti-U.S. Constitution criminal acts of the Bush Administration. Too many of the Bush-Cheney things are still intact. I realize that Obama has only been in office for less than half a year, but he has a huge staff of people who should be able to sort out the works of the GOP criminal element that ruled for the past eight years and immediately target those measures that were designed to take away our freedoms. I'll forward it to the White House today. Me ka pono, Keith Haugen Nu`uanu&&&3

For all the hype and hyperbole, surrounding Colt Brennan, the Run and Shoot, blah, blah, blah, UH continues to get the crap kicked out of them against "name" programs on the mainland... The 92 Holiday Bowl, with kids like Branch, and Sydner, remains the signature win for the program...&&&1
Brief asides - SB Editorials&&&Why is that people think they have a god-given right to catch catfish? Aren't catfish an exotic, non-native, introduced species of fish? Aren't we trying to keep non-native species out of Hawaii's ecosystem? The state is so hyped about keeping the foreign animals out that it sends someone to Kailua to shotgun mallard ducks (that got here naturally, by flying) yet at the same time it actually raises and stocks catfish? If people want to go fishing there is a huge ocean surrounding us that is full of fish (in case you hadn't noticed). If you just can't bear to live without fishing for catfish then move to the mainland. Geez, if we are going to promote non-native fish then why don't we raise and stock bears for those who want to hunt griz? The catfish hatchery is quite correctly one of the first things that should get cut out of the budget.&&&1

State workers feel the burn - Guest Editorials&&&I agree with you. I'm jsut surprised how the Star-Bulletin has been hoodwinked by the governor's furlough plan. I thought they were the smarter newspaper. I was dead wrong. Unlike the governor, I'm putting some thought into which newspaper subscription I should furlough, and I'm definitely leaning towards the Star-Bulleting. I wouldn't be so against the governor's plan if it were targeted, targeted to the state programs that are no longer related to the state's core functions, targeted to all the temporary employees scattered throughout state government, and also targeted to all the 6,000 plus civil service exempt positions that the governor and her political appointees have hired, outside of the civil service merit selection process. I also would not object so much, if the governor were also targeting the millions of dollars spent on consultant studies, many of questionable value, many probably going to friends and political supporters. Again, her "shared-sacrifice" mantra seems more to protect all of the above, instead of coming up with lasting meaningful cuts in state spending.&&&9

U.S. is prepared for missile shot - Hawaii News&&&Why should the United States allow North Korea to get around to finally making a missile that can strike us, only to then intercept such incoming nuclear war-head, blow it up, thus showering nuclear fall out over head? Does the United States, under the command of our President Obama, have the WILL to stop North Korea BEFORE they can fulfill their constant threats to attack these United States. That little Hitler, Kim Jong Il, is about to hand over power to his Hitler Jr. son, Kim Jong Un. Apparently, they do not take the United States seriously and are questioning our resolve. 90% confident that we can intercept, means 10% chance, they get through. That 10% chance allows for 100% vaporizing of our Hawaiian Islands and YOU in Honolulu. That is an unacceptable risk that must be confronted head on, right now, rather than wait around until they can get it right. All you anti-military liberals, who advocated cutting our missile shield defense first funded by our President Reagan, should rethink your stance. Just because you're an anti-war hippy type, don't mean Kim Jong Il and his Hitler son, are. Peace through Strength. Freedom is NOT free.&&&17

Safeway and Target stores in Hilo on DHHL land will create 500 ...&&&This removing of lands from settlement by the beneficiaries says a lot more about Kane's mis-management of the Hawaiian Home Lands trust. Removing lands from settlement by the beneficiaries has been the effect of such policies furthered by Kane. Prohibiting beneficiaries from settlement upon such lands and instead imposing commercial enterprises used and run by largely non-beneficiaries, reveals Kane's mismanagement of the trust. When the pretext of "generating revenue" and "it's good for everybody else" but the beneficiaries settling upon those lands the United States set aside for the beneficiaries, explains why Kane at the hearing before the US House Resources Committee two thursdays ago, was stupid enough to say the HHCA, 1920, was the United States redressing the wrongs the US did to the Hawaiian People. Wrong, Kane. The HHCA, 1920 was the US remediating the catastrophic effects of the corrupt Kingdom of Hawaii's Mahele of 1848, when the common native Hawaiian tenants were "cheated" out of their one-third share of the lands. The HHCA, 1920 has NOTHING to do with the overthrow in 1893, it has to do with the Mahele of 1848, moron. There is no need to remove lands from the HHCA, 1920, inventory, because the funding mechanism is in Section 5(f) of the Admission Act----the revenue OHA is mismanaging right now, and spending on non-beneficiaries catering to OHA's neo-alii complex. Kane can pretend this cheap promotion of Safeway and Target and non-beneficiary interest will help the beneficiaries, but the bottom line is that he too is joining all those that have placed non-beneficiary interest above the native Hawaiian interest, even if it is guised to "generate revenue." Stupid is what stupid does.&&&32

Furlough fiasco brings out the worst in our leaders - Hawaii Ed...&&&So, what does this say about their character? They don't have one, they aren't leaders, they are lemmings, and politicians. A leader 'leads' with sacrifice, and without thought of their longevity, they lead during the toughest times. Anyone can pass a budget when there is $$ in the bank. Anyone can pontificate about cell phone driving laws, about criminals, about taxes, but when it is most needed, the 'leaders' lead, while the whiners,'whine'. So far, between Lingle, House, and Senate legislators, all we have are whiners. It isn't hard to furlough or lay off people. But the threat of retribution, or possible not getting re-elected for doing the LEADER thing, keeps our lemming politicians in their cave, afraid, completely, utterly afraid. PATHETIC.

The AMA stated that there are no medical indications for partial-birth abortion. For those parents who fear the birth of a "defective" baby, is it more merciful to have the baby's skull pierced and the brains suctioned out? Third-trimester babies FEEL pain.

Job seekers invade Marine base - Hawaii Business&&&I am not an economist. As a matter of fact, I am pretty ignorant on the subject. However, judging by the recent rush to inject taxpayers money into failing businesses and banks, it seems that I am not the only one. Most of the time, at least it seems to me, those 'experts' dont have a clue as to what the heck they are talking about. Their economic predictions are so off the mark that it is giving legitimacy to astrology. But, contrary to popular belief, the economy is relatively simple to understand. One doesnt really need degrees from prestigious universities or to have graduated with Magna cum Laude in economics. All one needs is a thinking mind, common sense and the ability to understand that two plus two makes four. Consumers confidence: I am sure that the consumers have plenty of confidence. Unfortunately its the money that they dont have. And the reason is quite simple; they have already spent it in advance. For many years they have been seduced by a silent and, at least in the beginning, painless disease called Credit. On the basis of that, a false economy was created. Everyone was encouraged to spend, spend and spend money that they didnt really have. Buy what you don't need or can't afford, its all right, charge it now and pay it later. With this type of strategy, temporary jobs were created, a few people became very rich, the economy gave the illusion of moving full steam ahead and then bang! The bubble burst. Now many people find themselves enveloped by the tentacles of this seductive beast that has mutated from Credit to Debit and they seem unable to free themselves from it. Under the pretence of cost control we created outsourcing in countries where the cost of labor is lower. But here is the irony. Although companies are spending less in manufacturing thus saving a lot of money, did they pass the savings to the consumers? Fat chance! Prices continue to increase and jobs continue to disappear. Another reason may be the enormous influx of immigrants looking for jobs and a better life here in America. But here is another irony. The jobs they are hoping to find? They have been outsourced overseas! And the unemployment line grows longer. The auto industry, one of the major employers in the country is in a self inflicted mess and with slim chances to come out of it better and stronger. They are closing plants and assembly lines. No possibilities of jobs creation there, not at least for the foreseeable future, irrespective of what we are told. They are receiving vast amounts of taxpayers money and no one seems to know why or for what purpose. It is almost like the Government is paying the automakers tons of cash just to eliminate jobs. The only entity that seems to still create jobs is the Federal Government. Swell! Guess who ultimately pays for these jobs? You guessed. It is us, the taxpayers. What is the solution then? One thing is for sure. It is a must to return to basics, starting with the banks. They need to go back to the core business of just being banks, the guardian of our savings and the lenders to responsible borrowers. They need to discontinue these follies of recklessly risking the depositors money in pursuing unrealistic investment schemes that enriches few and dilapidates many. Banks should encourage people to save by giving them decent interest rates for their savings. Higher rates would be a natural filter and will separate qualified from unqualified borrowers, banks will have more liquidity and government won't have to continuously print what could soon become "worthless money". We should stop buying what we cant afford and learn again to live within our means because if we dont, you know that sooner or later we will have to pay the piper. But, as I said; I am not an economist!&&&4
Shelter from storms - Hawaii Features&&&Ray Lovell, spokesman for State Civil Defense, please tell us these shelters are inspected regulary, have backup power, food and blankets ready to go, medications, etc. Please tell us these are not just "Names on paper" that will be erased just like HECO can't get power back on because they were too cheap and stupid to not to spend $20 million on a quick power restart system, instead using the money to slip under the table to union bosses and their special funds. Auwe, just another day in the Nei.&&&2
Lawyer's work opened OHA voting - Hawaii News&&&Amazing Goemans was roomates with Democratic heavy-weight, and respected, US Senator Ed Kennedy. That Goemans would go right for the throat of the Hawaii Democrats' invention, their Office of Hawaiian Affairs, speaks to the integrity of an individual showing no fear in attacking an unconstitutional scheme even if guised as bettering the conditions of native Hawaiians. What Goemans' effort led to was not only a resounding victory at the US Supreme Court, it also laid bare the corruption of the Hawaii Democrats and their ploy to dilute the criteria of native Hawaiian as defined in the HHCA, and illegal co-mingling of 5(f) monies with general public revenue, that, according to OHA was and is "blended," but then spent largely on non-beneficiaries pretending to be native Hawaiian that cater to OHA trustees neo-alii complex. The Rice case was a seminal, Supreme Court victory, thanks to Goemans. Against the bitter, vitriolic attacks of the mini-maoles masquerading as "native Hawaiians," Goemans took the imposters on, pierced their self-righteous veil, and obtained that victory, against all odds. Rest In Peace, Goemans.&&&70

BOE votes to allow drug-sniffing dogs - Hawaii News&&&Once again our little third world of Hawaii Nei just doesn't get it. Dog sniffing dogs need to check every area in schools to include teacher, administrator, BOE and DOE. Why? Either you lead by example to ensure the entire school system is drug free, walking the walk, or you fail to set the standard. Remember the teachers caught using drugs??? Yes, we have no real standards, just using "do as I say" the easy way out for our cluelessly led school system by Pat Hamamoto. Never take the lead when you can grovel in the gutter. Way to go BOE/DOE, keep our children at the lowest rated school system in the entire USA. Auwe, just another day in the Nei.&&&63

This is how humans were able to survive and thrive. Just my feeling....you're entitled to your feelings. Thank you.&&&1

We don't need Olive Garden. Pasta Basta, Bravo, and Spaghetti Factory are just as inexpensive but (I'm told by people who know) have much better quality food.&&&21

It is illegal in Hawaii to use turn signals or to otherwise indicate turns or lane changes. Don't believe me?

Circle of Choy's - Hawaii Features&&&Sam Choy's food is overrated. Sam's a good guy, but I think that his food is subpar. When BLC first opened, it was the talk of the town. Went there about 1 year after it opened and was sorely disappointed. The quality of food was scary. Had ordered the oysters and they smell, literally. Told the manager, and his response was "Oh, they are suppose to smell." Then came the ribs, which were drier than cardboard. Told the manager again and his response was "They are supposed to be that way." Well, I guess it's supposed to be that I never go back to Sam Choy's. Haven't set foot into any of Sam Choy's restaurants for the last 15 years! Sorry brah .... that's how it rolls, you know ....&&&1

Clearing air on budget and real property taxes - Hawaii Editorials&&&Set the record straight? Oh puhleeze Ikaika Anderson, you sound as lost as Mufi. Why can't bureaucrats like you and Mufi get it right? Temporary revenue reduction is only corrected with a temporary tax increase. When revenue returns to normal, the tax goes away. Then again, you bureaucrats lie all the time to those who voted for you, saying you did your best. Wrong answer as you well know. All that happens is the extra tax money gets wasted and years from now you bureaucrats will cry again for a tax increase, never getting it right. Ikaika Anderson, we are very, very disappointed in your poor performance. You have already become one of "them." So typical for bureaucrats in the little third world of Hawaii Nei.&&&4

Call police if you see animals being abused - Pet Ohana&&&I would like to say that hawaii have to have strict laws against anyone that miss treat a animal and abuse an animal these laws of animal abuse should have been into law back there that there should be criminal charges against anyone that harms an animal. I am from hawaii and it is a shame to no that these people that have a pet ties them or put chains on these pets they are treated very wrong they cant fight for them self so someone have to stand on behalf of these animals. I would like to say that hawaii have these laws about bringing a pet from the states that as a pet owner the only way that we are allowed to bring our pets from the state is we have to compile with these rules that our pets from the states needs to papers stated the our pets are only allowed to hawaii if they have all there shots and Documents by the pets doctor that my pet have had all his shots. But my question is that hawaii have all these problems of FLEAS AND TICKS ALL DIFFERENT ANIMAL DEASE THATS BEEN IN THAT STATE OUR PETS ARE WELL TAKEN CARED OF THEN THOSE PETS IN THAT STATE OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. Hawaii has been charging us alot of money to bring our pets from over seas and yet we as pet owners we have to make sure that our pets dont catch fleas or ticks well we are visiting that state so as a PATRON for these animals hawaii needs to look at the problems that they are having with animal cruelty and how they respon to when an animal are being mistreated they need to change there laws back there and let people no that they cant treat any animal by ABUSE thats my statement to the state of hawaii.&&&3

Don't bother, be like me, they advise. Work for the state, get into the shipyard, join the union, live on the beach. A handful of students will break though hard crust and become great successes.

Medicaid breakdown - Hawaii Editorials&&&I am desperate. I have been turned over to Evercare after years of being under Kaiser Quest. I have been under this plan since May 1st 2009 and it is now June 17th 2009 and I still have no primary doctor, or any doctors under this care and am unable to go to my Kaiser doctors. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, high blood pressure, hypo thyroid, depression and anxiety problems, and seizure disorder and need to have blood labs every 3 months to check my levels of medications to make sure every thing is normal. When I was under Kaiser Quest I had a team of doctors: primary, neurologist, rheumatologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and physical therapist that worked together to make sure my health issues where all taken care of and that I was doing alright. I am on 14 different prescription medications and have no doctors and my meds will run out as of June 28th. I have called all the doctors in the phoned book and the Evercare booklet sent to me. No doctors are accepting Evercare patients in Wailuku, Kahului or Kihei. I live in Kihei and want to go back to my Kaiser doctors which were so convenient, so caring and so efficient with their work. I have called my "nurse" corrdinator, I have called Evercare, I have called Medicaid, I have called our Senator's, Roz Baker's office. I still have no doctor and I am having anxiety attacks everyday due to this situation. NO body calls me back saying there is a doctor within my area. I can not travel all the way to Makawao every week to see a primary care doctor. This is not acceptable. I go to Makawao on the weekend, when I feel good, and that has been months now. Please help me with my situation. I know I can not be the only one complaining about this Evercare Medicaid plan and no doctors that are under this plan in Maui. And after reading this article, I really don't have any faith in this plan. Something has got to be done, or our hospital will be over flowing with people who no longer have a doctor... due to this medicaid plan that sucks!&&&1
HawTel has possible buyer - Hawaii Business&&&It's too bad the SB didn't also include in this story that Albert S.N.

At least here, a couple folks said howdy to me, so I guess that (sadly) puts Hawaii in the lead for "RBJs Friendliest Place In The World Award". This is an honor not to be taken lightly.&&&1
Kalani sex education program blasted&&&i don't know where this Iervolino guy come from but he certainly doesn't understand the teens and their activities. there's nothing wrong with a school curriculum dealing with the real issues. if it's too much for some conservative parents to take, then stay out of it and don't try to stop it. you people are only hurting these vernerable youngsters. and what's wrong if it is taught by transgender counselor? open you eyes and mind Mr.Iervolino. one thing i was glad not to hear in the article was dealing with religious issues. hope i'd never hear that side of it.&&&245

Instead of taking the easy way out by making it financially harder for WE THE PEOPLE, why not look into THEIR OWN BACKYARD and be accountable for governing their departments efficiently? EVERYONE knows it does NOT take 10 workers to fill 1 city street pothole AND, it does not take 1 day to fill that 1 pothole! EVERYONE knows about Medicare and Medicaid fraud and yet WE THE PEOPLE are still forced to pay into a fund that may not even be available when it's OUR turn to take advantage of the taxes we have been paying all our employed years. EVERYONE knows how goverment officials live very well on tax money...OH YAH, I FORGOT, our ELECTED gov officials weren't ELECTED to do yard work. DUH!&&&1

Equity stalls tourney cuts - Hawaii Sports&&&The number of entrants is not the root problem. It's how they are selected. If the 8 best teams in team sports are selected, that would be fine. But if the usual politically correct, logically incorrect way of awarding tournament berths is preserved, then reducing the field to 8 berths is a problem because it reduces the likelihood that the 8 best teams will get a berth.&&&1

One of the biggest haters working in the newspaper industry today, far-left guy Paul Krugman, actually had the audacity to write a column entitled 'The Big Hate' where he branded me, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and other commentators as dangerous to society. Since Krugman's hatred towards President Bush and conservatives in general is just about unmatched, that is a stunning piece of hypocrisy."&&&6

Hi! ... I'm new here!&&&My name is Razorback Jack. Most folks call me RBJ or simply Jack. I am a for real, born, bred, and fed Arkansas Hillbilly. I live in the heart of the Ozark Mountains and I am a loyal Arkansas Razorback fan. Enough about me, I wanna talk to you about "Whats up?". If I find you people friendly, I may stay awhile. You see I'm a broke old man and this is likely to be as close as I ever get to being there in the Paradise you live in. Now, I don't mind answering any questions you might have ranging from eating possum to wearing Big-Smith overalls. But as we go along, I may have a few corney ass questions myself. So, if/when it happens that you mistake my good natured intent for something dis-respectful, I apologize in advance. We will all agree that I'm not the swiftest horse in the corral and our relationship can begin. My first question: Is the girls there as pretty as we are made to believe here in the Ozarks? Because every Island girl we ever seen on tv or in magazines was a damn site prettier than my wife Bernessa. I'll thank you to reply.&&&14
Lingle wants to cut state workers' pay - Hawaii News&&&Before furloughing selected state employees she should start the folling: 1. Reduction in force by layoff of all emergency/limited term workers. She has not done so yet. 2. Reduction of contract workers presently employeed by all departments, she has not done this also. 3. Pull all positions that have temporary employee's assigned to it. 4. Freeze all hiring. 5. Make pay cuts for all STATE employees not only select state employees. If she would take a 3% pay cut from all 30,000 state employees she would probable make up her budget. Some one should check # 1-5 and see why we still have retired employees getting payed to come back to work as contract workers, emergency hires, etc. Why should select state employees get smashed with these furloughs when retired, friends, etc are getting payed. STOP this first!!!!!!&&&5

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Excellent letter, Tom McDonald. The hearing before the House Committee on Resources, held just this past Thursday, 6 11 09, in DC, on this Akaka bill, was boycotted by Obama's DOJ and DOI team. Aging hippie Abercrumbie wondered out loud where these officials were, and how come a unified no-show. THAT is a sign of a crack in the strategy wall of the corrupt leading this effort to heist the REAL native Hawaiians share of the HHCA and 5(f), and try to give it to this fake Indian tribe that will be comprised of mostly haoles and asian pretending they are native Hawaiian. Obama, apparently, ain't as stupid as the local Democrats pushing this con made Obama out to be. PLUS, if you look, Obama don't owe the Hawaii Democrats NOTHING, having earned his own stripes in the fire of hard-core Chicago politics, without having to ride on the coat-tails (as local Democrats owe their rise to power) of others. Obama said he would sign the Akaka bill, but that is not a blank check and he ain't going to sign just anything the Hawaii clowns plop down in front of him. The three current versions of this bogus bill have two things in common: 1. Seperate Americans by race (even if it is a miniscule 1/64th or even less); AND 2. Try to seize the REAL native Hawaiians HHCA and 5(f) lands. You can rest assured the US Supreme Court, following the Rice and recent ceded lands case (both of which OHA lost) gives anybody a clue as to what they will do with this bogus tribe which, in reality, is simply a larger version of what OHA is now----mostly asians and haoles engaged in identity theft of REAL native Hawaiians.&&&12

2009 Legislature theme? Me first - at 38 percent - Hawaii Edito...&&&Considering the Governor and her directors, staff and other employees have received numerous pay raises over the last 20 years, trying to compare the legislators first pay raise in 15 years is an apples and oranges comparison. I did not see the Governor, nor her staff, try to roll back their pay to 1994 levels to compare with the pay the legislators were held to. So in the end, this issue is just more shibai by Lingle's PR team and her favorite pitbull, Ted Hong.&&&36

Obama Boos&&&By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Associated Press Writer Ricardo Alonso-zaldivar, Associated Press Writer  Mon Jun 15, 5:24 pm ET WASHINGTON  Barack Obama isn't used to hearing boos. For all the young president's popularity, the response he got Monday from doctors at an American Medical Association meeting was a sign his road is only going to get rockier as he tries to sell his plan to overhaul the nation's health care system. The boos erupted when Obama told the doctors in Chicago he wouldn't try to help them win their top legislative priority  limits on jury damages in medical malpractice cases. But what could they expect? If Obama announced support for malpractice limits, that would set trial lawyers and unions  major supporters of Democratic candidates  on the attack&&&3

Malama Makua's true agenda is to drive the United States from Hawaii, so they can try and re-establish the bogus, corrupt, foreign concept of a monarchy and re-install the alii caste back into power. But where are the native Hawaiian alii? There are none. Since their ancestors married out of the Hawaiian race as was the fad at the time, all wanting to be white and later asian, the descendants of the alii caste today are now haoles or asians, really. "I'm proud to be a 1/64th Hawaiian, because I'm an alii descendant. Just call me queer, um, er, I mean queen."&&&36

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&"While some oppose our military recruiting in our public schools, there's a more dangerous recruitment in our public schools. In fact, gangs, drug pushers and pimps recruit within our public schools without much public protest. Meanwhile, many have gained positive opportunities through the military they might not get otherwise. They include economic, educational and career opportunities as well as the pride that they did what they could in protecting our homeland. While I have never been in the military, I proudly support our military recruiting in public schools. It is a lot better than having only the gangs, drug pushers and pimps recruiting our kids." Pablo Wegesend Honolulu What nonsense! First of all - gangs, pushers and pimps are rigorously confronted by school staff, the Sex Abuse Treatment Center, Boys and Girls Clubs, parents, Big Brothers, DARE, and myriad other protective elements working in the schools. Secondly, compared to the military, gangs, pushers, and pimps are disorganized and hardly can compete with the recruiting budgets and paid, professionally trained recruiters that the military can send openly into many school systems. And the outcomes from military service are not all positive; it is a lie to imply that they are. Brain injury, PTSD, amputations, and death are real and not unusual consequences of service and ought to be mentioned in any honest portrayal. Of course, we should also keep in mind that recruiting young men and women into the military also exposes them to moral peril and the chance of their killing innocent women and children and having to carry that burden for the rest of their lives. Sorry ... but military recruiting of high school boys and girls is not as sweet a deal as you would have us believe.&&&1

Audit's findings add to DOE misgivings - Editorials&&&Contracts are only one part of the problem. The DOE spends $3.2 million per year to fund Hawaiian education programs were most of the employed kupuna cannot speak Hawaii. 84%(145 out of 173) kapuna rated themselves "less than competent" in the Hawaiian language. One school employed a kupuna (traditionally a knowledgeable elder in Hawaiian society) that was only 19 years old. I guess in today's world 19 could be considered elderly. How about these apples? Substitute clericals incurred a cost of $1,719,914. Substitute security attendants $264,736, and substitute custodians a hefty $2.4 MILLION. However, substitute teachers only took up $800,000. Guess they covered for the 600 teachers who went of a taxpayer-funded trip to Orlando, Florida at Walt Disney World at a cost of $1,573,852.23 Notice the word substitute. Ah, our tax dollars at work educating our youth.&&&414
Paragliders' prerogative - Columnists&&&Interesting information ... a word of caution to any paraglider thinking of flying over East Honolulu, Kahala, Kaimuki: don't do it; the entire area is habitually overflown by military helicopters that routinely cruise at altitudes below the required 1000 feet and often in groups. Their regular violations of the flight rules have created a dangerous situation for everyone living in this area and have turned what was once a peaceful place to live into an incredibly noisy zone.&&&5

D-I state football expansion bid still alive - Hawaii Sports&&&Increasing football participation is good. But, so is increasing participation, by providing more State Tournament level opportunities, in all other sports. Cutting participation in golf? Wrestling? etc.... C'mon, folks. Letting a kid shoot for State Championship Tournament participation as a brass ring to shoot for. The more possibilities, the more you're keeping him/her off the streets at least 2 hrs. a day in season, and most likely, more than 2 hrs a day out of season. Charge more for State Championship games. Extract higher upfront fees from schools across the board (everyone benefits if there are more chances to compete). This knee jerk reaction by the OIA to reduce participation simply stinks. Here's an idea, if the OIA continues to insist: Reduce OIA participation in State Championships. Either that, or tell the Superintendent and everyone else working in that building to take a cut in pay - I'm pretty sure there's little going on in there that achieves the results in the positives coaches achieve scratching plays in the dirt of the poorly watered fields.&&&3

State tourney sizes are hot topic - Hawaii Sports&&&One person interviewed for the article stated, "It's a lot of money to send teams over (to Oahu from the neighbor islands)." A school that doesn't want to pay for its team to fly interisland to participate in a tournament should be allowed not to participate and have its tournament berth filled by another qualified team from any conference. Frankly, in some years, in some sports, there are some conferences that don't have tournament-level teams. If a school with such a team declines to have its team participate in the tournament, it would open the door to having a more qualified team from a stronger conference play in the tournament, which would be a good thing.&&&5

Grassy area was never meant to be archers' lot - Hawaii News&&&The archery range is located 300 yds from the closest parking, making the range unusable for the small group of handicapped archers that were regular users before the recent ban on access. As suggested by myself and the other archers who frequent the range, all the park maintenance staff would need to do is re-locate the existing concrete barriers to allow closer parking to the range. This would prevent the "illegals" from going behind the range and allow us the same degree of access as other park users now enjoy. To penalize archers, a small group without any voice, is unfair. Especially when a cost-free solution is available.&&&1
Paragliders' prerogative - Kokua Line&&&Those were some good comments on paragliding. The only issue I have is with the stratement that these are considered ultralight aircraft and hence should not be "flown over congested areas". That Part 103 reg is really intended to address powered ultralights, with rigid metal frames and snowmobile-type engines, rather than paragliding chutes. People and structures on the ground are much more likely to suffer a close encounter with a skateboarder or bicyclist, let alone a car. Paragliders fall out of the sky onto peoples' heads about as frequently as meteorites do.&&&1

If DOE does this, they will save money and maybe not have to cut back on needed services as much as they plan to out of necessity.&&&2

He would never agree to something like this Akaka bill, that would allow asians and haoles to control the share of lands that were supposed to go to the native tenants, and which lands are the HHCA and 5(f) lands.&&&1

I would be interested in knowing, in the last 15 years, how many bond offerings, for how much money, and for what projects? Also, how many bonds have been paid back to investors, both principal and interest?&&&3

Whale study implicates sonar - Hawaii News&&&Marine mammals inhabit an acoustically rich environment that is being overwhelmed by the increasingly noisy technologies we use in the oceans. It is only common sense that sonars designed for long range detection of objects in the dense watery world of the oceans and major seas, fjords, bays will be likely dangerously loud for the supersensitive echolocation organs of the whales and their relatives. The proliferation of weaponry in the oceans parallels the spread of such into near space and all over the land. Will we realize a future in which the paranoia driven defense industries so dominate that the entire global environment loses its biological richness in favor of unlimited proliferation of offensive and defensive weapons systems?&&&7

Bleed us tax-payers. Spend as much up front HOPING the feds kick in. But if the feds do not fall for the 5.1 BILLION DOLLAR con job, then simply loot our treasury, enriching his friends while enjoying inarticulate and hard to trace forms of kickbacks and favors.

Parking fee increase opposed - Hawaii News&&&When I've been lucky enough to vacation in Hawaii, I like to begin my day with an early walk around the park. It seems to me the bulk of the people I see parking appear to be hotel workers. They certainly fill the free spots quickly. Perhaps they should meter ALL parking, but charge less of an increased fee in order that others might also have access to the park.&&&72

UH med school program helps students gain entry - Hawaii News&&&The UH School of Medicine is missing the boat by catering primarily to Hawaians and Pacific islanders. There are many well-qualified students from the mainland and other parts of the world who have applied, and would do great service to the islands, but they are rejected because of a systemic attitude of discrimination. The UH School of Medicine should not be run like Bishop Estate/Kamehameha Schools.&&&7

School-year saga - Hawaii Editorials&&&Aloha, The WSF provides the schools with $5,000 per student from $12,000 (after dividing the appropriation by the number of students, less CIP and Bond Repayment). Where does balance of some $7,000 per student go? The DOE/BOE discussion of cutting funds from the schools is the DOE/BOE call, not the Governor. The DOE/BOE must take the WSF off the table allowing all the schools to function normally (except for additional funding for CAS, utilities and others). Taking the WSF off the table keeps all the schools open and functioning with staff and teachers. NOW, there are two spending ledgers in the total DOE/BOE budget, the WSF that provides funding for the school ($875 million) and the overhead funding for the administration ($1.225 Billion). The DOE/BOE must find the cuts in the $1.225 Billion side of the ledger, no matter how difficult it is. A few ideas, could we not transfer Adult Education to the U.H. system? Could be not privatize the food service, repair and maintenance, and others as the military has successfully done to provide a better service with huge savings? What about privatizing the DOE payroll system? Why not reduce the District office to three personnel and increase the Complex Area Superintendents office to best serve the schools? Why not reduce all the offices of Assistant Superintendents? Why not?&&&11

Ferry shutdown to cause economic ripple effects - Hawaii News&&&doom and gloom DOOM AND GLOOM The Super Ferry is a cash loser not a gainer. It is operating at a significant loss waiting to be on the government welfare train shipping Strykers and military equipment to the Big Island. It hasn't paid back the $40 million in Honolulu Harbor improvement monies. It caused $2 million in additional damage to moorings it hasn't paid for. It wants the DOT to pay for millions in improvements to the Big Island port including docking, a special car ramping for the Ferry ,parking, restrooms and more. The Super Ferry also wants the DOT to create a new birth for it's second vessel at a cost of additional millions. When the Super Ferry first advertised their arrival they made clear the profitable fare for the low end traveler was $60-80 and for a standard passenger vehicle at $110-120. Since that time we have seen $140/barrel oil and ticket prices held artificially low (read at a loss) with less than 50% passenger capacity being filled. Recently the Super Ferry needed to suspend operations for the weather...the travel (6 hour trip) to the Big Island will be a niche crowd. Your typical visitor will not spend 12 hours of there vacation getting sea sick on the Super Ferry. The Super Ferry is a prime example of corporations bullying their way past laws to get their way. The Supreme Court has now ruled. Play by the rules everyone else is required to play by. Lingle and the rest should be ashamed.&&&14

Hawaii near top for alcohol abuse - Hawaii News&&&The figure I would like to see is how many people asked to have themselves, loved ones or clients placed in alcohol addiction programs, and were told there's no room. As a counselor and a teacher in Hawaii, I was constantly frustrated by the lack of slots in programs, even whan parents had insurance coverage. I suppose with cutbacks in everything, that problem will be even worse now. I saw kids as young as 14 turned away from programs even though they had very serious problems with alcohol, as did one or both of their parents. There are private programs available, but they are outrageously expensive. Isn't there a middle ground somewhere? Where are our priorities if even kids can't get the help they need?&&&57

I had gotten asthma for the first time ever february of last year and i thought it was because i was sick..but i noticed it was when my neighbor smokes, which is more than pretty often, thats when i cant breathe..!!..one day when i was sleeping..i just starting feeling like i was gasping for air it was sooo sudden!!..sooo scary!!..it was my neighbor smoking..i hadnt realized it..caused i usually sleep during the day..(nap). I strongly feel there should be a more aggresive way to rid the smoking problems for all apartment units and homes in hawaii.. I dont feel that its their right to take our lives without our permission!..its very frustrating!..physically.. i noticed that our contracts for renting states that the units are non-smoking, yet they say there is nothing they can do about it..why is that..of course there is something everyone can do..to see this kind of law come to pass..where there is a ban on smoking in units..in my own opinion, if i were painting a wall in my unit and fumes or something were affecting my neighbors healths..i would atleast close my windows or change the paint, or something..but thats just me..some people have no consideration for others at all and they always seem to wait till a legal matter arises..thank you for allowing me to post my comment.. also ive already joined the americans for nonsmoking org...check it out..&&&60

Lingle wants to cut state workers' pay - News&&&Raise the General Excise Tax by 1/2% and have the whole State contribute toward the budget deficits. The State should also look for possible cuts in State programs that may be considered luxuries compared to sacrificing aid to the disabled and poor. If cuts can be made by laying off middle management positions in the State, it should be pursued to reduce labor cost. The State wasted money over the past years and now it is time to tighten wasteful spending and perhaps learn to not overspend as in the past. The State should strip the $90 million dollars from the education budget as the governor is suggesting to help balance the budget that ends June 30th of this year since it will be replaced with Stimulus Funds anyway. The education department people should stop being so selfish and share in the sacrifice. If we have funds in the Rainy Day Fund, we should use it now since it is raining right now.&&&134

Pio Sagapolutele left a legacy on the islands - Columnists&&&RIP Pio. I knew him years ago, when he was still in college. He was a good guy. Can't help but wonder if the brain injury that took his life was either directly or indirectly caused by years of crashing his head into others on the football field, both in game and practice. In boxing or Mixed Martial Arts (aka "MMA" or "ultimate fighting') athletes are put on 30, 60, or even 90 day suspensions if the State commission feels they took too much damage in competition. Boxing and MMA commissions also mandate frequent MRI brain scans to monitor the fighters. Football players bash their heads all-game in the NFL with the force of their entire body weight, not just a gloved hand. And even the newest helmet technology can't fully protect their brains. It troubles me when I hear a player has suffered a concussion and is allowed to compete just a week later. This player needs 30-90 days rest, like a boxer or MMA fighter, because the brain needs time - lots of time - to heal even after the smallest concussion. It doesn't have to be an 'out cold' concussion because the accumulation of smallest bruises on the brain also puts their health in serious risk. The volume and seriousness of brain injuries that occur in football is one of the sport's dirty little secrets. I think its time that the football players' brain health be put under the same scrutiny as boxers' and mixed martial arts fighters'.&&&7
Inside the search for UH's next leader - Guest Editorials&&&Dr. Greenwood has spent a long life dedicating herself to helping students. She is a great champion to raise money for projects, and I have also seen her push up her sleeves at a BBQ restaurant on vacation and spend her entire meal counseling a high school senior about a life in nutrition services - and consider it well-spent time. Dr. Greenwood is not perfect, but she is transparent. My question would be, "why would anyone even think of accepting her resignation after reviewing the well-known facts." Dr. Greenwood has been a sterling asset to Vassar, UNSC, President Clinton's science team and many other positions. She would be an outstanding asset as the President of the University of Hawaii.

Pio Sagapolutele left a legacy on the islands - Further Review&&&I was remembering Pio's very first football practice back with Pac-5. At some point someone noticed blood trickling down his forehead. When he took off his helmet he was missing the large pad that covers a lot of the hardware up front. The screws in the helmet were cutting his forehead with each hit, but not a word of complaint out of him. Not knowing any better, he must have thought everyone was playing like that, and he wasn't going to be the one to cry if everyone else was enduring. You can imagine what the rest of the team thought about him....I still remember some 24 yrs later.&&&3

Brief asides - Letters&&&TO YOUR HEALTH Don't gamble when it comes to your health "Alternative medicine" is something of a misnomer these days, given the growing number of adherents for whom natural remedies are the first line of defense in the treatment and prevention of pain and illness. Millions of people take dietary supplements and unconventional therapies on blind faith, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. But such treatments continue to gain steam a despite a lack of scientific proof that they work a partly out of dissatisfaction with conventional medicine. Consumers should apply a dose of healthy skepticism to claims made by companies selling alternative treatments that are unregulated, unproven and, sometimes, unsafe. It IS the GREEDY Pharmaceutical & Surgical Corporates that INITIATED & Continues to OUTLAW Alternative Medicines. EVERY prescription TODAY has SIDE-AFFECTS that are WORST then the symptom or problem!! Talk about "unregulated, unproven and, sometimes, unsafe."???&&&1

Hawaii will be coming out of the 2009 season without their entire starting offensive and defensive lines; both starting outside linebackers; both starting running backs; big hits in the slots; and of course Alexander. So, Hawaii has to face USC with a new starting QB and new starters in both lines. It will be brutal. Like when Hawaii played the Gators in Alexander's first DI game. This season Hawaii opens against who? Central Arkansas to allow them to ease into the season. Next season it will be all downhill starting with the USC game. But they will be better in 2011.&&&8

Where is Burger King? Where is the Salvation Army? Where is the Food bank? Where is the YMCY? Can you give me two dollars for a cup of coffee? Gee, I'm stuck can you loan me some money to get back home? Can we still sleep on the parks? When is the free zoo day?&&&1
Whatever Happened: UH-Hilo pharmacy grads&&&$100,000 per year for putting pills in a bottle at Longs?!?!! Sheesh! All Longs pharmacists do is hand you what the doctor ordered. They don't have to figure anything out. You just give them the prescription, and they just fill the bottle with what the doctor ordered. No skills needed - only the ability to read doctor's handwritings. No wonder health care is so costly! Can't we get a machine to fill pill bottles and slap on labels??&&&8
Born identity - Hawaii Features&&&It's kind of scary that one computer glitch and you could become a non-person, an alien with no right to drive , vote or even live in Hawai'i. I guess the paper version has been abused plenty over the years in identity theft ,BUT, It still seems like something you can see and hold in your hand is a little more solid. I guess this the brave new world coming right at you...you are just a few electrons somewhere and possibly could be deleted on someone's personal whim. Is it possible to still get registered by a church parish or similar solid record?&&&7
Sumo's stars not nearly as big as they used to be - Further Review&&&I watched sumo for 28 years, until they stopped showing the results on T.V.; by doing that they cut out a big viewing audience in Hawai'i.&&&2
Kaneohe resident receives special mention - Hawaii News&&&D-Day was a spectacular event. But the men involved did a duty that men before them had done all through that war. men that landed at Saipan, for example, fought at Sicily, Anzio, and places like Corrigador and Bougainville. And the hell that was Iwo Jima. And then there were the great warriors of the 442. Great event, out of the ordinary, with ordinary men that rose to greatness out of a generation of such men - and of such women as well. Been there, saw that.&&&5
Letters to the editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Hannah Miyamoto. We'd be better off legalizing gambling than same sex marriages.&&&8
Letters to the editor - Letters&&&Mahalo Kathryn Kane, excellent letter as well as stating the obvious. It is fool hardy for HGEA to ingore these dire economic circumstances. Lingle is doing what it takes to insure our State's economic survival. Look at California. Does HGEA want us to go down that road, and no more nothing even for the welfare their members going end up on, if we go belly up? Fulroughs more better than ala alas (not too much of NOTHING).&&&26
Hawaii legislators to get 36% pay raise - Hawaii News&&&Another example of the self-serving, hypocritical & arrogant nature of our elected officials a36% increase in legislators salaries following years of bad faith dealing with the teachers & other state employees. Serving the public seems to be that furthest thing from their minds & actions a unless the intent is to serve the interests of the elected public officials.&&&1
Piracy sinks online plans for 2 anime - Hawaii Features&&&Jason Yadao It's not all over yet and yes I do agree with you at the same time. I liked the last show much that I am promoting it free of charge in Japan and the U.S. Also if you need my help just ask as I would love to see this a success in Hawaii. Aloha&&&4
Police and Fire - Newswatch&&&Most municipal and tourist attraction parking lots have very visible signs warning folks not to leave valuables locked in their cars. One would think police officers would have the best appreciation for the number of auto break ins and thefts. How, then, do we keep hearing about off duty police officers' firearms, IDs and other equipment being stolen from their parked cars?&&&1

Bill would ban Styrofoam food containers on Maui - Hawaii News&&&from Wikipedia --- Biodegradable waste is an important substance due to its links with global warming. When it is disposed of in landfills, it breaks down under uncontrolled anaerobic conditions. This produces landfill gas which, if not harnessed, escapes into the atmosphere. Landfill gas contains methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The European Union Landfill Directive puts key requirements on member states for the management of biodegradable waste in order to stop global warming.&&&32

Wireless gadgets make perfect gifts for grads - Tech View&&&I did research Amazon's Kindle 2 and bigger brother Kindle DX, which is 10.4 x 7.2 x .38". They look like potentially good products, BUT it is NOT a Microsoft Windows XP or Vista-based operating system. If you want to read your MS Words-created documents, you must email them one at a time to yourself at your new Amazon email address. They will be CONVERTED to their own format at a cost of 15 cents per. I've got over 5000 documents, letters, stories, etc. and am not inclined to put myself through such an expensive project. I really wanted to buy the Kindle DX so I could read in bed holding up a light-weight electronic book instead of a thick heavy notepad or laptop which gets too hot on my tummy. Hewlett-Packard has a notepad in which the screen can be twisted backward and folded back on top of the keyboard. You can scroll down the pages, but it weighs 15 pounds! I think I'll wait until HP, Dell, or somebody makes the same thing Amazon sells AND installs Widowns XP or Vista with a large 500 Gb HDD, and color screen. Please make both a small 6" and 9.4" diagonal reader. You'd better make them cheaper, too.&&&2
Population on Oahu down, up on other isles&&&As former military member sationed on Oahu, I believe people leave due to the fact that it is criminally expensive to live, poor quality of life while wasting so much time in malignant traffic, isolation from the rest of the world, uneducated natives, limited real jobs, third world schools, and a crumbling infrastructure. True, the economy is resilient, howver it's a socialized economy. It's a jobs program, work for the State, county, or the Federal governemnt. Since taxes won't go away, the economy should continue to be relatively solid. But realistically, there is limited oppportunity for college graduates, unless they want to live with their parents or the rest of the entire family, which leads to develpomental stagnation.&&&205
Up to the task - Hawaii Sports&&&I guess it's an old boy and old girl network.....This hiring is unbelievable. No Div 1 or Div 2 or even any college coaching exeperience. i'm sure she is a great coach but can she recruit. Does she know how to recruit. I see she got the most out of her previous squads. Same thing is going to have to happen at UH.....Seriously this hiring was a joke. Then again maybe she has plenty of family to fill the stands.&&&3

Hawaii's Kuhaulua calls it a career - Hawaii Sports&&&Jesse is what you call a PIONEER. He has become a legend in his own time. Japan saw an opportunity to introduce and internationalize sumo to the world by accepting a gaujin into its higher ranks. They saw big yen signs in their heads.&&&1
Stand-up paddleboarders annoy some swimmers at Ala Moana Beach ...&&&"We're not selling anything" - oh, please. This is true, pure commercial activity and Mr. Chang needs to get a grip on what is & isn't commercial activity.

State seeks resolution to landfill issue&&&Stop making excuses! The original deadline was known a long time ago-this appears to be the plan all along. Do you think that the people of Hawaii are that dumb? How much longer must the Leeward community have to carry the burden of having the "dumps" in their mist? How about having every county/town take care of their own trash? I know-Not In My Backyard-let those people have the trash after all, they are used to it! How unfair.&&&6
Landfill closure postponed 18 months&&&"I would like to use this time to educate them," Hannemann said. "No one who has the facts can fully say we can shut down a landfill in 18 months. There's always going to be a need for a landfill." If the Mayor wants to place it in Nanakuli then he will have to pay for it - ALL monies collected from the landfill use MUST be appropriated for purposes designated by the Nanakuli - Ma'ili neighborhood board. Otherwise, State Rep. Karen Awana, who represents the Nanakuli area, said Waianae Coast residents do not want a landfill closer to homes.&&&37
City should keep looking for landfill alternatives&&&The odor from the Opala at that landfill will never be taken care of by aerosal sprayers. Even with the tradewinds the Hauna from that area will always be until the Hpower plant can be built. Another problem for the City and County of Honolulu to deal with. I sure hope that they get their act together on this problem site.&&&40
Height limit rises at Nanakuli dump&&&The HECO plant is the entrnce to nanakuli. the landfill is in Makakilo, across the srteet from Ko Olina. Or are you going to tell me Ko Olina is in Nanakuli too? horrible headline, as there is a small landfill in Nanakuli. But its not Waimanalo Gulch....&&&7

Letters to the Editor - Editorials&&&please read the comments in the USA paper about the Hawaii Notre Dame football game. We have a long long way to go to be a good football program. Some things that would have to change.(1) Get out of the WAC. The WAC is a very weak league. If you play weak teams all the time, you can`t compete with the Big boys.(2) Get rid of the pass and shoot offense. To compete with the big teams, you have to have a good running game.(3) Get a big time Coach, who can instill discipline on our team.(4) Work on improving fundalmentals. We have a really bad image in the nation about our "In your face attidute",such as the guys dressed up as Warriors beating on drums.&&&18

The queen's estate - Hawaii Editorials&&&-Again on reviewing part 2 of this article a dispassionate observer would be inclined to question the competency of H.R.H. Lili'uokalani based on the lexicographical content, why then does her popularity rating remain at a premium high among so many even to this day? Here is one of many tributes: Quote: "Queen Lili'uokalani was an exceptional, selfless, magnificent human being. Hawaiians can remember and appreciate her gifts given in perpetuity to her people. Queen Lili'uokalani's legacy begins with her example of dignity, perseverance, honor, steadfastness, dedication, sacrifice, nonviolence, and spiritual devotion. It is our responsibility to live the values exemplified by her life and to share these values with our children and 'ohana. With Lili'uokalani as our example, may our lives honor our ancestors." E 'onipa'a 'oukou na po'e maika'i o Ko Hawai'i Pae 'Aina.&&&15
Homeward bound - Hawaii News&&&-To understand why Hawai'i is not a "state" click here: What an inditement to name a weapon of mass destruction after the Sovereign land of aloha. What a pity "tactics and techniques" are not applicable to the growing homeless problem in Hawai'i, with some one in ten residents on food stamps, the wastage of taxpayers money on weaponry is "beyond belief."

Newswatch - Hawaii News&&&I cannot agree with the census bureau's findings..Unless they had actually gone to each household in hawaii to check if they are using the internet. Another concern is that we are not connected with the other 49 states, we are often left out, or the last ones to be recognized by the other states,until we achieve our recognition by sports or an event that draws attention. Our economy is no greater than the mainland,in fact our prices of products to fuel is no where close to the mainland prices. We are an island that uses our computers systems for Business , entertainment, and communications. Why?..because we can't drive to another state or island. We lack the luxury of the other 49 states. being able to transport from point a to point b, without difficutly. thx.&&&2

Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Who is Ed Sullam to get off on critizing the citizens of Hawaii in 1926, when they constructed the Natatorium? To mock his own conception about the Roman lettering on the Arch, does that make him suddenly and expert on Roman lettering? Did he live at the time of the Roman empire? Wouldn't our folks back in 1926, have been closer in time to the fall of the Roman empire than his advocacy for mayor mufi's pre-planning to destroy this monument to the memory of those brave men that gave their LIVES in service to our country in WWI? Something stinks about this "architect" and the suspicion starts in never having heard of this clown before, his sudden appearance, and its timing in the midst of mufi's plan to destroy this National Monument. If Sullam thinks the roman lettering is wrong-----too bad. It's staying, sucker.&&&10
Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Bob Jones is a joke. His self-proclaim status of his own integrity in advocating a UH professor as the next President is an even bigger joke. Where does he come off in shooting his mouth off where he just makes himself look like a fool saying he is known for his substance over politics. Give me a break!! Such a lampoon writer like him should be relegated to where he is best known and that's on the comic pages. Bob Jones is a failure at what he does and now he his own status is a columnist in the Mid-Week magazine and writing letters to the editor. What a joke!!&&&4

Kauai, Big Island home prices fall - Hawaii Business&&&Tighten your sealt belts, because there is a Third Wave heading toward shore. If the latest flood of listings on MLS is any indication, they are a lot of people who are totally oblivious as to how bleak the market is. They actually believe that they can sell their McMansions for appraised value, even after is sits in the Tropical weather empty, rotting month after month. The cost of ownership in Hawaii is beyond the imagination of many people. Sooner or later the carrying costs for many of these disenchanted speculators are going to wipe out their entire savings and take their homes, but golly, the Realtors will be there, inflating the listing prices to get their 6% commission, while all the buyers laugh and drive right by. This is much worse than the 90's, but people have such short term memories..&&&2
Oahu water park sold - Business&&&"This is purely a financing deal," said Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park General Manager Takuya Ohki. "We (Village Roadshow) sold the assets to get the capital money to expand. We are building a $30 million water park in Phoenix, Ariz., and we plan on putting more money into Hawaii." Sounds more like they plan on taking more money OUT of Hawaii, like to AZ!&&&5

Former Lt. Gov. Tom Gill dies - Breaking&&&I knew Tom Gill. I campaigned for Tom Gill. I now mourn Tom Gill. He was a true leader who inspired a generation of progressives. We knew "You can Trust Tom Gill" and that "Tom Gill Cares." No one, not Ariyoshi, Waihee, Cayetano and Lingle have come close to what Tom Gill could have been as our Governor. Today's Democrats will never know what it was like to be considered a "Burns guy" or a "Gill guy" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The party probably reached its zenith because of the competition. The 1972 precinct elections set attendance records that stood until the Obama vote last year. And the 1970, 1972 and 1974 State conventions -- wow! Thanks Tom for being our leader. Hawaii is a better place today because of your work, inspiration and courage. Aloha, until we meet again.&&&12

Then there is the federal government who wants a Green America. They will force us to to drive small fuel efficient cars.

Project looks to put drug on ice - Hawaii News&&&You can bust every meth lab and meth user you can come up with and you will not even START to put a dent in the huge demand for meth. Meth addicts LOVE their meth and if you shut down the local labs then the Mexican mafia will simply increase the amount of meth it exports into the USA to meet the new demand. Methamphetamine should be legal. Mexico just legalized possession of small amounts of drugs. Switzerland reaffirmed its legal heroin system. Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001. Legalizing meth would kill meth labs, meth houses and the meth mafia overnight. A group of 10,000 very serious policemen, prosecutors, attorneys and citizens have formed a group to legalize ALL drugs, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( ) They see what happened when we legalized alcohol in 1932 as a good example of how drug legalization would work. They're sick of chasing drug users and sending innocent people to prison for decades just because they like to get high. This foolish war on drugs has lasted 37 years and cost us over a TRILLION dollars and we are not an inch closer to stopping drugs. Mark Montgomery boboberg@nyc.rr.com&&&3

As for your letter however, everyone in the private sector is doing their part. What you are asking for sounds like subsidies to your utility payments and for your landlord to not make a living. Sorry but you can only pick so many pockets before folks say enough is enough. The private sector has been paying thier fair share of health care costs for a very long time. They are getting layed off, hours cut and have not had pay raises in years. It is time for you to figure out how to tighten your belt a bit and if your state job is so bad, find one in the private sector that is better for you.&&&12

USC is always 4 deep on the depth charts, with their $10.5 mil $$$$ budget. Thats why Coach Pete will never leave, unless he gets bored with winning.&&&1
Inside the search for UH's next leader - Hawaii Editorials&&&Greenwood may be a good choice for UH president, but this statement by Holst is wacky: "Dr. Greenwood apologized for the inadvertent mistake, and the UC General Counsel James Holst, who has since retired, told the committee: "The employment processes involved isolated circumstances; at no point in her university service was there any pattern of impropriety or ethical lapses." So there has to be a PATTERN before there is a problem? John Wilkes Booth never had a pattern assassinating anyone before Lincoln, so what's the big deal?&&&12
China freedoms backslide 20 years after Tiananmen - Hawaii Edit...&&&The actions by China's government speak volumes about the government's insecurity and its recognition that Chinese citizens have little faith in the government. The government has the guns and the network firewalls and the unprincipled will to use them both in order to preserve its illegitimate hold on power. It's hard to see how this unfortunate state of affairs will ever change for the better.&&&11

Shell's ban on coolers, food in place since 2007 - Kokua Line&&&The beaches, the roads, Kaena Point, the Shell, the parks ... it seems that alcoholics have ruined many places on the island with their rowdy, slovenly behavior. Almost every day one reads a story of a crash, a false crack, trash strewn, someone beaten, another killed. Where once you could enjoy a beverage (adult or not) under the stars, now all is banned due to the Ainokea hooligans and their piggy lifestyle.&&&5

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Let me see if I understand the gist of the letters today. Those who appear to be state workers (or are related to them at least0 seem to think it is perfectly ok to just keep raising taxes so they will NOT be affected in any way shape or form during the current economic downturn. Those who appear to be just regular taxpayers say enough is enough we are taking the brunt of the downturn and don't think it fair to have to pay even more so the state workers don't have to suffer at all. In a perfect world everyone would have a decent job with decent bennies for life. Currently only those who get paid via taxes sem tohave this while everyone elese does what it takes to get by or make due with less. You decide, which side is right in this, the givers or the takers of the taxes (And don't give me that BS about state workers paying taxes, yes they do but since their pay COMES from taxes it like buying dollar bills with hundred dollar bills).&&&28

Testing guidelines for swine flu revised - Hawaii News&&&A wise change in emphasis, still with the caveat that towards fall special and probably more comprehensive efforts will be needed to keep track of both the possible increase in deadliness of a mutated version of todays virus and a more viable transmission capability from person to person, also possibly having developed by that time.&&&1
Shell's ban on coolers, food in place since 2007 - Hawaii News&&&"Even though we checked the coolers, many people were still smuggling in alcohol in fruit juices, water bottles and injected in food," he said. "All of these we could not check." If alcohol is the issue, then why is alcohol served at the Shell? The issue is profit--charging an outrageous amount for alcohol as the means to control drinking. At the Waikiki Shell, in addition to outside food and beverages, Quintal said you are prohibited from bringing in ... any kind of camera ... So now they can confiscate cell phones, most of which have built-in cameras?&&&5

Nah-- Lets let her fly thru for politics sake implies the Bull....talk about race based politics Bull! You take the cake.&&&111
Unions say Lingle now pursuing wage cuts - Hawaii News&&&Each Governor has this same problem. Due to the way the finances are set up, the majority of the budget is not able to be shaped by the governor. Thus, the governor really only has a small number of tools available to reduce expenditures, amongst which are employee benefits and salary, maintenance, and new buildings. Every politician wants to leave a legacy, so cutting back on new buildings isn't a great idea. Besides, how can you reward your contributors if you don't buy their services? The employees are an easy target because of the stigmatism associated with being a public employee (lazy, unmotivated,...) Like any other broad definition, it is wrong. Likewise, thinking that public employees can suffer a reduction in pay is pie in the sky. Public employees have already taken a hit on their salaries this year. Health insurance premiums went up at least $100 a month and are likely to go up some more before the end of the year. Any further cuts will cause even more employees to apply for section 8 housing and other government "freebies" as they won't be able to survive otherwise. Lingle should look at reducing services, moving government out of downtown to cheaper digs, and cutting back on new CIP projects. It's the only way to achieve the savings that are necessary for long term cuts.&&&313

I guess their delusions of their ability to play at a higher lever are founded on the times we beat up on weak opponents. Consider this - do you think any of these guys could hold a spot on Fresno's roster? I doubt it. Best advise is to stop believing the local paper's pouring of undesreved compliments and play hard EVERY GAME! See you next year Vinnie, Kevin and Matt.&&&1

Incumbency, stagnation is recipe for stale politics - Under the...&&&Trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Fact: The cost of doing buisness in this state is high. Fact: Many businesses can choose to locate in Hawaii, or someplace else. If you had a business, and you could sell your products/services cheaper by locating somewhere else, you will most likely locate your business somewhere else. Fact: Businesses located in this State have a whole lot of things that increase their cost of doing business in this state and make it harder to succeed in this State. If you were a business person, would you choose to start a business in a state that is more friendly to your goals, or in a state less friendly to your goals. The answer to all of these questions is, that is the reason many businesses do not want to be in this State. If you will notice, most of the businesses in this State are in this State because they have to be in this State in order to be in business. When you have an environment where people can start a business in the State, because it makes economic sense to be in this State, then you will have more businesses being started in this State.&&&1
UH expects USC series to pay off - Sports News&&&As long Pete Carroll is the head coach at USC you need a great offence to beat him.&&&2
Chancellor of UH-Hilo stepping down in 2010&&&Why does the Regents now decide to give her a pay raise retroactive to 2007. Could it be it had to be backdated in order to give her a "high 3". If that's the case, then the regents are playing fast and loose with public funds. This criticism is not intended to detract from Tseng's accomplishments but instead to point out bad management policies by the UH Regents. I might add this has become routine for them to throw public money around as if they had no fiduciary responsibiity.&&&22

Lingle signs law reducing pay for top state officials - Hawaii ...&&&WOW!! She's taking a whopping 5% pay cut while she expects state workers with families to support to take a 13.8% cut on top of an increase in their share for medical benefits? Gee Linda, how kind of you. Here's an idea: Why don't YOU and those other 207 wealthy upper rank state employees take a 13.8% pay cut and the rest of us will take the 5% pay cut!?&&&16

Sprinklers cut fire losses - Hawaii News&&&The Fire Department is an area where huge money an be saved. These guys work 10 days a month with large salaries and also consume many part time jobs from others. Most buildings have sprinkler systems and therefore the need for a huge force of "full time stand by" is a waste. The reason they sent 35 men and all those trucks is because of certain standards and to justify their budget. Ever notice at every accident or even a call for an ambulance to a house for an illness brings a fire engine? It is for the justifying of the budget, if one looks at HFD stats you will see more calls for medical than anything else...fact! Fires are few and large fires are even fewer with smart buildings and new installed fire protection plus better buiding materials. Fire Departments were started as volunteer organizations many years ago and make no mistake that is where they should get back to with a small full time staff and many back up volunteers. Now those with large egos will tell you that volunteers are not properly trained; then train them. Volunteers have the will determination and heart and are just as trainable as the guy you are paying large sums MONTHLY. Oahu has more fire stations than many mainland cities and please distances are not that far apart to get back up. Agencies like HFD are a huge drain on city budgets and tax payers and the unions lead the charge. Then of course electeds don't want to offend the endorsements they seek so they go along with wage and benefit increases. The job demand is not increasing so why should pay scales. As stated go look at stats and the types of calls and then consider their larger than it should be budget. Like I said here is a department where serious dollars can be better spent. Please wives, girlfriends and paid professionals don't reply with the hero stuff...the word has been so abused and the true heros of this world are our troops and no one else!&&&4
Letters to the Editor - Letters&&&Vern R. Lentz - when was the last time you saw a temporary tax increase stay temporary? It is high time to revisit exactly what services are provided with tax dollars and determine their need and cost. Sorry but if the unions won't talk about bringing labor costs in line then furloughs accross the boad will have to happen. BTW, the education system is NOT underfunded but it IS almost the worst in the country...thowing more money at it is NOT going to fix what is wrong with it.&&&15

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Mr Sofos, you say 'State employees receive four weeks vacation and two weeks sick leave per year. So the furloughs will not kill them.' That doesn't make sense. Even if they get that much time off, how does it not 'kill' state employees. It just means even more time that work doesn't get done. They will still take time off, they can't use the time instead of the furlough. Even though there are many in these forums who claim state employees are lazy and overpaid, the fact is that they DO provide services we need. What are you willing to sacrifice when they aren't around to provide the services? Longer DMV and unemployment office lines? Longer times for road repairs, longer periods between inspections of food and liquor establishments? Fewer lifeguards, fewer prison guards? You pick what you want to live without.&&&11

Directors of the other state agencies, especially those who are constantly decrying budget cuts in terms of how many keiki, elders, single moms, etc., will be "hurt", could take a lesson from her. Maybe she ought to run for governor.&&&2

However, the ecoterrorists (Sierra Club, Greenpeace, etc.) will come and eat your children! As they win their foolish battles, they grow in strength. Soon you will need their permission to buy a car, or gasoline, or electricity, or any of the thousands of consumables that they are against. If we bow to their will, it will be back to the stone age for us all.&&&17
Halawa bridge should be completed in October - Hawaii News&&&Over 3 years behind schedule and over $3 million over budget. That's pretty good for Hawaii. Deciding what do with the Natatorium has taken 30 years (and it's still not decided). Don't even get me started on "The Stairway to Heaven". The government spent tons of money to repair it, then said "By the way, don't use it or we will arrest you for trespassing".&&&7
Competitive edge - Hawaii Features&&&Just a correction on the phrase which originated from the batting coach of the Kansas City Royals, Charlie Lau - the correct phrase is "Practice Perfect makes Perfect", not Perfect Practice for Perfect Practice only makes the practice perfect. He stated it because people were saying Practice makes Perfect so he corrected people and told them that Practice does not make perfect, Practice only makes Practice.&&&5
Honolulu Farmer's market opens at Blaisdell tomorrow&&&That should be a good thing for the people of central Honolulu so they can buy reasonably affordable quality food from the farms !

I did most of my food shopping in Chinatown and avoided the tourist shopping areas like Waikiki !&&&1

According to the SB, people are smuggleing in snakes constantly. Snakes are NOW on Oahu, Kauai, and the big island. TALK ABOUT KILLING TOURISM. I saw a story maybe 1 year ago a guy was caught at the airport with a snake and he was taken directly to jail and fined $10.000. Actually what should have happened to him. Just think, as a tourist on the beach, you saw a snake slithering by, OH MY WORD. The beach would be empty in seconds. AND..word travels fast...ESPECIALLY TO TRAVEL AGENTS. I know Hawaii has an immediate snake response team. MAYBE $50.000 fine would be appropriate and expell the party immediately. Aloha from Northeast PA.&&&5

Letters to the Editor - Hawaii Editorials&&&Hmmmm I wonder why this paper is not talking about the young hometown recruiter that was gunned down by a converted extremist Islamic follower in Little Rock, AR? The story should be just as important as the unfortunate story of that doctor who was murdered just as heinously and viciously. All the kid did was join the US Army, come back home for two weeks to "help" recruit family and friends and enjoy some time home after bootcamp....he was gunned down by this extremist because he joined the Army. Where's the national outrage? Where's the same news coverage by the msm? Last night, Olby went on a tirade about lumping us pro-lifers with this murderer and NO other voice to speak for us who do not justify this murderers actions for our cause. Outrageous assumptions towards the majority of pro-lifers who absolutely DO NOT condone such actions!!&&&41

Israeli envoy building bridges - Hawaii Editorials&&&It is with deep regret that I read the Starbulletin's Christine Donnally' article concerning Jacob Dayan, Israeli envoy. It is unfortunate that Hawaii leadership welcomes a representative of a terroristic government, Israel, that illegally occupies Palestine, steals its water, takes its citizens land,murders its citizens, treats Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian, as second class citizens and denies them food, water, housing, medical care, etc. Israel is a government in violation of International Law and Human Rights. Israel has a strong nuclear program that is threatening to the Arab states as well as Iran. It is unfortunate that Sen Inouye evidently refuses to recognize the sailors of the USS Liberty that were murdered by Israeli forces in 1967. He dishonors their memory by his misguided support of Israel. The Starbulletin reporter should have asked the 4000 Muslims and Palestinians who live in Hawaii how they feel about an alliance with Israel. I do not support such an alliance.&&&5
