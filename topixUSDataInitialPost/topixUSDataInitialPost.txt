605	46	4	9	45	19	good  maybe if we held people who sell guns responsible for the crimes committed with those guns  it would cut down on the number of nutjobs who get guns  just as a bar owner can be held liable for serving alcohol to a drunk who later harms someone in a dui  if you want to sell a product whos primary purpose is to kill  then you should be liable if that product is used in a crime 
606	11	6	4	69	27	do the right thing and deport anyone who benefitted from this scheme  including nursing mothers of  citizen   here in us  all we hear about i the person responsible for the scheme  never is there mention of the hundreds of thousands that they know about you have been part of the scheme  a good case in point is when we find dl issued from the same address  tax forms  etc  we just let them go  if they knew they faced the same punishment as the person who sold it to them  then some will think twice  whatever  do something to benefit the american people for a change

632	1	12	6	124	78	the fact that a respected representative would take the time and effort to publicly chastise a high ranking cabinet-level secretary only adds fuel to the speculation  instead of firing off a letter for public dissemination  why didnt one of the members senior staff simply pick up the phone and call the secretary  the press has conistently reported that this a  personnel matter  which explains why there has been a repeated retorts from dhs that  we dont commment on personnel matters   with such matters  the accused has privacy rights and generally  the matter is reviewed by an independent party and a recommendation made to the organizations senior official  until that review is completed  the pundits can only speculate based on rumors and inuendo about whats going on  and given the wide range of rumors floating around  its best to be patient and let the official process unfold  another question raised is whether the white house was consulted on mr  spires leave situation  one can bet a month of lunches that because mr  spires is an appointee  the action was cleared by the white house political personnel office  i suspect they too are letting the investigative process play out  so  my advice is for everyone to just  chill-out  and not draw inflammatory conclusions on facts that have yet to be revealed  so

668	1	20	18	167	127	 i have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915  and my view has not changed  it was a genocide   a full  frank  and just acknowledgement of the facts is in all of our interests  nations grow stronger by acknowledging and reckoning with painful elements of the past  thereby building a foundation for a more just and tolerant future  we appreciate this lesson in the united states  as we strive to reconcile some of the darkest moments in our own history  we recognize those courageous armenians and turks who have already taken this path  and encourage more to do so  with the backing of their governments  and mine   president obama 24 4 2013 background info  the 12 nov 1914 turkish jihad fatwa propping wwi entry was based on a lie  it  cup  ottoman turks attacked russia first for no reason and not the other way around  therefore it turks  as aggressor criminals  abused islam and allah by declaring an uncalled for jihad  jihad is supposed to be  struggle to excell  but the turks abused it as a tool for their turk islam empire dream  the fatwa implied ottoman armenians and other anatolian christians as targets by not keeping them exempt  like it clearly did for their christian allies  germans and austrians  from hostilities ordered by the jihad fatwa  finally  the tehcir  deportation law specifically declared and exposed armenians as open targets for extermination  sanctioned by the jihad fatwa  therefore  instead of denying  unless tr comes out clean and admits that  the armenian genocide was a direct outcome of nov 1914  fake jihad declaration and the proceeding 1915 tehcir  deportation  law exposing the armenians and other civilian christians of the region as enemies paraded as targets to be exterminated  tr will be regarded as the immoral promoter of the similar  jihadist  terror happening all over the world today  those individuals giving support to the turkish state denial policy in the name of loyalty are wanton culprits in this crime against humanity

777	3	13	8	137	105	clearly  nobody know who are the faceless and nameless people that are illegal invaders that do not pay taxes and live on food stamps from obama  clearly  even if the mozlem brother terrorists in the 11 million invaders consists of 5   their number will be 550 000 terrorists and criminals that need more than 700 000 police officers and fbi agents to stop attacking america and destroying it from within  it is time to save america from the sold out gang of eight senators that are blind to see america becoming the land of the worlds terrorists and criminals but not the land of the americans  clearly  john mccain and lindsey graham represent rinos that go blind after obamas agenda and will never stand up for american people  gop is wrong to send john mccain and lindsey graham that go by what the media says and what the polls about the immigration say  the result is selling america to the terrorists and criminals of the world that will come easily with extended visas or through the open borders to get obamas food stamps and obama phone in return for voting obama  the immigration laws are not enforced by obama who makes his own rules so why bother to write new laws that would not be enforced by obama who needs votes first and cannot care less about who vote for him  gop will cease to exist as a party when the mozlem brother will become a voting bloc of 10  that will control the destiny of america to fall apart as a country

779	97	15	7	136	143	many would agree that acts of violence should be cause to ask an elected official to resign her or his office  or to give good reasons why not  in this light  it seems that anyone demanding resignation or removal of supervisor dumler  d-albemarle  must also demand removal or resignation of delegate fariss  r-albemarle  for the same reasons  gender violence  the daily progress reported in octobe   r 2011  during the campaign that mr fariss won      wednesday  october 26  2011   quote  republican candidate matt fariss of rustburg was named in an emergency protective order in 2002 that required him to stay away from a lynchburg woman  fariss campaign manager said wednesday that fariss was not available for comment     fariss  who has refused to talk to the news   advance of lynchburg about any of his legal issues  is getting financial support from state republican party officials for his campaign  which is making heavy use of mailed brochures  some of them describe his family values  a lynchburg police officer asked a city magistrate to issue an emergency protective order on march 9  2002  that required fariss to stay away from a lynchburg woman  the officer request said the woman stated to me that fariss broke through her back door to gain entry into her house when she told him to leave  history of violence   unquote  the police report notes history of violence  if anyone has not demanded the resignation or removal of honorable mr fariss - for history of violence - one wonders about motivations in demanding resignation or removal of honorable mr dumler - for history of violence we support requesting any elected official who has committed violence - against humans or against animals - to resign from those duties  in southern albemarle county that would include honorable mr dumler and honorable mr fariss

1110	10	10	23	287	132	first of all the problems with the usps were not started by the u s  government  but by local government and the main and number one culprit is the 911 addressing authorities there  if you are told that you can not deliver a letter or article to an address because the local officials claim that it does not exist because it is not a part of their addressing system and even though you know the address and everything else about the addressee  the local authorities are refusing to allow the delivery of the item to its address because it is not a 911 address that they issued  that is what we call interferring with the delivery of the mail  and if they are not interferring with the delivery of the mail then they are making an attempt at regulating speech  both of which are crimes  but then there are the other aspects of this problem such as violating a federally protected contract  fraud  attempted fraud  tampering with private communications  and the list goes on and on  the problems that the u s p s  are having are strictly due to the local government and not with the federal government except the federal government does not seem to be enforcing the laws  if you want to destroy a country then the best way to do that is to disrupt their communications networks  and the local county governments accross this country have done just that with the way that they implemented 911 addressing  the economy went to hell and so did the safety of this country at the same time  the housing industry  and banking industry and everyone else that received a government bailout from the tax payers were with us all the time  but the one thing that did change was addressing and that is what got this so-called recession going and the funny part is that the people who can stop the problem think that the only solution for them now is to let it go  and the problem with that is that it will not stop until the addressing problem is corrected  because of the many breaches in the public trust that occured and are still occuring  rural america does take things very personal and they do not forget  and trying to enforce these improper actions by force only makes the situation worse  world war i and ii were won because the people were with the government  if the people are not a partner  but are being made slaves of a system  then the system is doomed  the federal government should just delivery a persons mail and not waste money and time trying to determine if a persons address is acceptable

1133	26	8	4	54	37	where is the compromise  it sounds like the democrats are getting exactly what they want and only a few liberal republicans like john mccain are willing to support it  a compromise would be allowing people to privately sell guns between states and repealing provisions of the the gun control act of 1968 as long as they had proof of passing a background check  cards could be issued to people who can pass a background check so there isnt a need to basically track all firearm purchases through gun dealers  that is going to create a de facto gun registration scheme and is absurd

1469	2	26	27	194	136	is pandering simpering and anti-civil rights anti jobs crusader ct gov malloy acting just like a two faced deceitful hypocrite  after all guns are the original civil right   well  according to the courant newspaper he pulled political favors and handed out political bribes to keep his felon criminal son from doing any prison time  and the son is walking around free on probation  the son perpetrated an armed home invasion  his son took a plea reduced down to 1st degree felony attempted robbery of his drug dealer using a pellet pistol he threatened his victim with as being a firearm  plus a plea to a drug felony    look it up  so we do know that malloy thinks that a violent felon should not face any consequences and should walk around free if part of the malloy family  but if a regular citizen with a state permit to carry pistols and spotless record happens to own a handgun purchased totally legally last year  but which molloy thinks now just holds too many evil cartridges  and if they fail to jump through all of malloyï¿½s hoops to reregister that magazine  or they load it up  then malloy thinks they should do felony jail time  off duty and retired cops  this means you too  so you better not load your 15 round glock with more than 10 rounds and you better register every magazine     two faced  hypocritical  maybe that evil pellet gun just forced malloyï¿½s son into turning into a violent felon all by itself  and maybe malloy will outlaw all pellet guns and air guns and such  small minds really have nothing better to do than to steal freedoms away from others  and if you think that anti-civil rights crusaders like ct senator blumenthal are not committed racists  look at all their proposals to tax bullets and guns beyond reach so that only people with his  70 million fortune of privileges like he has could have them or protect themselves  not ordinary people  and especially not law abiding working black people with low incomes that have a clean record and qualify for a carry permit but who may be stuck living in crime infested neighborhoods  these smug self styled emperors are wearing no clothes  and they need to be seen for who they really are

2077	1	31	36	219	141	gay marriage in illinois and life  some argue same-sex gay marriage is a slippery slope leading to the abolition of all marriage  there is truth in this argument  the real issue  however  hidden behind the smoke screen of same-sex gay marriage is an attack on the roman catholic church in illinois  furthermore  this attack on the roman catholic church has at it source anti-semitism  this is the case because the roman catholic church is one of the few institutions in the world that takes judaism seriously  something some jews dont even do  to be in favor of same-sex gay marriage is to ultimately be in favor of death over life  the logic of this may not be self-evident  but surely the symbolism of the defining act is  life is the principle value in judaism  and in turn it is at the root of roman catholicism  too  how is life in this world sustained  the common sense answer to this is the symbols inherent in heterosexual love and marriage  in opposition to this symbolism  same-sex gay marriage offers us the symbolism of anal intercourse  instead of the bright new face of a child  we are offered the dark  bottomless hole of sex divorced from procreation  this is the same dark hole into which the nazis wanted to condemn the jews  to be against same-sex gay marriage is not to be against glbt people  to be against same-sex gay marriage is not to be blind to the problems and discrimination glbt people suffer in the world  be that as it may  same-sex gay marriage is not a moral solution to these problems or that discrimination  consider the analogy of poverty  yes  there are poor people with problems  nevertheless  stealing is not a moral solution to the problem of poverty  the best moral solution to poverty is not communism  but charity and a republic with a constitution and a free economy  likewise  the best glbt people can hope for is not an immoral redefinition of marriage  but life in a constitutional republic  an all powerful  progressive state cannot tolerate religion  especially roman catholicism and judaism  nothing  especially god  must come between the individual and the government  such a government will use same-sex gay marriage to attack and discredit religion  a government that adopts same-sex gay marriage is by definition anti-semitic  illinois should not join the anti-semites of the world by adopting same-sex gay marriage  you say all love is equal  but if same-sex gay marriage passes into law you will see only what the nazi upheaval saw--all death is equal

2541	12	6	5	122	69	in a nutshellï¿½we all know obamacare was made out to sound legit at the very last second by john roberts calling it a tax  now there is a suit filed in d  c  that argues a tax must have originated in the house of representatives which obamacare clearly did not  according to the us constitution article 1 section 7 a bill can begin in the house and be tossed to the senate for completion but a tax must begin as a tax in the house and cannot be turned into a tax by the senate or by the ussc  we were told by all of em from the get-go obamacare was not a tax and they stuck with that until they sensed defeat coming from the ussc  this suit has a very good chance of ending obamacare because it points out clearly obamacare is unconstitutional across the board and john roberts plucked up by trying to be a smarty pants  however with all the lawyers fighting obamacare at the ussc youï¿½d figure one of them would have pointed out constitutional procedure concerning taxes at the very moment the word tax came to light  nonetheless the suit is dead serious and has teeth

3226	3675	36	25	258	262	romneys platform   12 sound reasons to repeal obamacare  no matter what the leftist court stacked with 2 political appointees says  obamacare has to go and i will repeal it  so  let us count the ways that it violates basic principles of sound policy  1  it discriminates against young people  forcing them to purchase health insurance at inflated prices in order to subsidize older beneficiaries  2  simultaneously  the law imposes severe penalties on young people who use health savings accounts to secure health benefits for themselves in later years  3  already the administration has granted a long list of exemptions to various companies and unions  4  recently  the department of health and human services dictated that employers  including religious organizations  must cover contraception and abortion-causing drugs in their health plans  apart from any moral objections to such provisions  why should the federal government tell employers and employees what their health insurance has to cover  5  good public policy would encourage health care consumers to shop around and purchase insurance policies that are best suited to their own needs and spending priorities  the health care reform bill does the opposite  decision-making power is turned over to bureaucrats  who pay no price for decisions that are costly or wrong-headed    good public policy does not raise false expectations  backers of the health reform bill violated this principle three times over  here are those obama lies  6  they promised a  anyone can  keep their plan if they like it  false  according to a mckinsey   co  study  a third to a half of employers plan to stop offering health insurance beginning in 2014  faced with expensive mandates and less expensive fines  many employers will choose the fines and cause their employees to move to government-sponsored plans  7  the plan would mandate many new benefits and still reduce the average family premium by  2 500  which is clearly false  another study concludes that a typical family health insurance plan costing  12 300 today will cost more than twice that by 2019  there are no  free  mandates or other benefits -- to paraphrase milton friedman  8  that it wouldnt add  a single dime  to the federal deficit  false  it adds over  1 76 trillion to the debt  last october  the administration dropped the long-term care program known as the class program from implementation of the new law as financially unworkable  it also added  111 billion premium subsidies to its proposed fiscal 2013 budget  9  good public policy avoids ticking time bombs  the legislation will increase medicaid enrollment by an estimated 24 million new users by 2015  this will put states further into debt  10  the law includes a massive new health entitlement income redistribution program for families earning more than three times the poverty level  in 2014  it will channel up to  3 000 in taxpayers funds to families making up to  95 000  11  the law is fiscally irresponsible  it includes a raft of new taxes  but these appear to be wholly inadequate to the task of paying the bill for over-promising and extending new entitlements to tens of millions of people  that leaves rationing as a last resort  and the governments own reports contemplate major cutbacks in medicare spending down the road  12  the affordable care act is truly unaffordableï¿½ and unsustainable  our government should not erode our freedoms  degrade our quality of life  or bankrupt our future  the health care reform bill does all those things  if it is not struck down  it should be repealed

3512	1	22	10	258	291	questions to the fbi and new york lawmakers about judge laura dragers assisting and enabling a powerful and rich male litigants to filing a fraudulent bankruptcy petition  my question to the fbi and lawmakers is  1  if judge drager was given a notrarized sworn to  federal document stating definitively that the male litigant is  parking   750 000 in someone elses name  2  and judge drager also knows that the male litigant had has another  500-700 000 in cash from selling artwork deliberately excluded from the male litigants net worth statement submitted to judge drager court  3 and the male litigant owns a company with 5 offices around the world as per bloomberg business week  4  and the male litigant owns two mercedes sports cars and a race care which was purchased right before declaring bankruptcy  5 and the male litigant also buys  100 000 benz during the bankruptcy  6 and the male litigant spent hundreds of thousands of dollars vacationing with a friend in south beach florida  and skiing in the alps and partying all over the world prior and during the bankruptcy and judge drager knew about it 7  and the male litigant spent thousands of dollars starting a new company by diverting funds from the original company of which the wife was 50  shareholder and a company which she primarily financed  8  and the judge drager knew that the male litigant unlawfully pocketed stole  2 million of his wifes court ordered money from her eviction fire sale of her apartment  in a separate room at the closing with all of the judge drager lawyers in attendance including the judges most favorite crooked lawyer raoul felder  while judge drager threw an innocent mom and three shell-shocked children out onto the street for a mere  17 000 in maintenance costs on a virtually mortgage-free apartment  which the first judge said should be remedied by taking out a simple home-equity loan  9  and judge drager knew that the  male litigant  had conservatively  4-5 million in cash on hand while filing a federal bankruptcy petition  where his primary creditors were his 90 year old mother  his sister  his brother-in-law and his pool guy  and the debt was for at most  75 000 10  and judge drager had statements in chinese showing that the male litigant had moved even more money to china and had chinese bank accounts 11  and judge drager was given a copy of the  male litigants  hand-written diaries stating a good portion of his deals that closed during the time he filed a fraudulent bankruptcy petition  amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars of which the  male litigant  became very rich 12  and judge drager orchestrated an arrangement with gibson dunn   crutcher to tank the  female litigants  claims in the bankruptcy by not filing documents on time  irrespective of the fact that gibson dunn represented the  male litigants  business partners while representing the wife  so judge drager could eliminate 3 years of unpaid child support  5 years of all court ordered expenses  in the next court date 13  and judge drager worked on behalf of the  male litigant  by calling the bankruptcy trustee and bankruptcy judge to lobby on the  male litigants  behalf  even though the  male litigant was filing a fraudulent federal bankruptcy petition and committing bankruptcy fraud    my question to the fbi is   has judge laura drager committed a crime  if the fbi could let me know an answer to my question  it would be appreciated  thank you

3546	2	28	24	324	261	washington ï¿½ the decline of two-parent households may be a significant reason for the divergent fortunes of male workers  whose earnings generally declined in recent decades  and female workers  whose earnings generally increased  a prominent labor economist argues in a new survey of existing research  david h  autor  a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology  says that the difference between men and women  at least in part  may have roots in childhood  only 63 percent of children lived in a household with two parents in 2010  down from 82 percent in 1970  the single parents raising the rest of those children are predominantly female  and there is growing evidence that sons raised by single mothers ï¿½appear to fare particularly poorly ï¿½ professor autor wrote in an analysis for third way  a center-left policy research organization  in this telling  the economic struggles of male workers are both a cause and an effect of the breakdown of traditional households  men who are less successful are less attractive as partners  so some women are choosing to raise children by themselves  in turn often producing sons who are less successful and attractive as partners  ï¿½a vicious cycle may ensue ï¿½ wrote professor autor and his co-author  melanie wasserman  a graduate student ï¿½with the poor economic prospects of less educated males creating differentially large disadvantages for their sons  thus potentially reinforcing the development of the gender gap in the next generation ï¿½ the fall of men in the workplace is widely regarded by economists as one of the nationï¿½s most important and puzzling trends  while men  on average  still earn more than women  the gap between them has narrowed considerably  particularly among more recent entrants to the labor force  for all americans  it has become much harder to make a living without a college degree  for intertwined reasons including foreign competition  advancements in technology and the decline of unions  over the same period  the earnings of college graduates have increased  women have responded exactly as economists would have predicted  by going to college in record numbers  men  mysteriously  have not  among people who were 35 years old in 2010  for example  women were 17 percent more likely to have attended college  and 23 percent more likely to hold an undergraduate degree  ï¿½i think the greatest  most astonishing fact that i am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out ï¿½you need more educationï¿½ and have been able to respond to that  and men have not ï¿½ said michael greenstone  an m i t  economics professor who was not involved in professor autorï¿½s work ï¿½and itï¿½s very  very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals  and men are not  itï¿½s a fact in need of an explanation ï¿½ most economists agree that men have suffered disproportionately from economic changes like the decline of manufacturing  but careful analyses have found that such changes explain only a small part of the shrinking wage gap  one set of supplemental explanations holds that women are easier to educate or  as the journalist hanna rosin wrote in ï¿½the end of men ï¿½ because women are more adaptable  professor autor writes that such explanations are plausible and ï¿½intriguing ï¿½ but as yet unproven  he disagrees entirely with the view of the conservative analyst charles murray  in ï¿½coming apart ï¿½ that men have become ï¿½less industrious ï¿½ ï¿½weï¿½re pretty much in agreement on most of the facts ï¿½ professor autor said of mr  murray ï¿½but he looks at the same facts and says this is all due to the failure of government programs  eroding the commitment to working  and weï¿½re saying  what seems much more plausible here is that the working world just has less and less use for these folks ï¿½  contd

4196	786	32	28	316	222	alex jones brought up a good point on his december 17  2012 show that most people wont talk about  listen to the first hour of the podcasted show  why are hard leftists like diane feinstein  chuck schummer  and michael bloomberg -part of the israeli lobby in america- trying to disarm america  they are the loudest voices going after the second ammendmant right now in america but openly lobby for us taxpayers to arm israelis so they can defend themselves  and yes  israel has a right to defend itself but so do americans  the connetecuit shootings were a horrific tragedy but going after the second ammendmant is not the answer  these mass shootings always happen where there are strict gun control laws and the public is disarmed -remember criminals will always find access to guns whether they are outlawed or not and innocent civilians are usually the victims of mass shootings  the answer to these mass shootings is to train and arm responsable us civilians including trusted school faculty on how to defend students from any crazies that show up until cops arrive  we need less guns in the hands of criminals and more guns in the hands of innocent law abiding citizens who are trained how to responsibly own and use firearms  isntt it wierd how after the election all of a sudden all these shootings take place and now gun control is at the top of the headlines  you have the nfl  bob costas   news media figures  and national politicians now engaging in a full court press for gun control  look how the corporate media is promoting that guns be taken away so americans citizens cant defend themselves from all forms of criminals  the media is being absolutely transparent in its attempt to brainwash americans into believeing that we dont have the right to defend ourselves with the second ammendmant  this should alarm all american citizens given the fact our government has been seized by communist revolutionaries backed with offshore corporate fascist money  these bought out political revolutionaries within our illegitimiate federal government are now aggitating the rest of the world and garnering hatred against america from countries like russia  china  south america  and the middle east  the type of facism that is now being pushed in america was used in stalanist russia  cuba  nazi germany  fascist argentina  corrupt mexico  to name a few examples  its the same gameplan now being used on america  and every time a country was destroyed and remade into a failed state dictatorship it started by disarming the general public so people could get bullied by the tyrants into further authoritarianism with no way to fight back  now is not the time to disarm america  pull your money out of the major banks so they cant create derivatives with it and put it in local credit unions or small banks  call out  vote out politicians that want to disarm america and boycott the corporate media by turning to non corporate news  if these politicians want gun control why dont they get rid of their personal entourage of taxpayer paid for armed security bodygaurds  they want gun control for citizens  not themselves  americans can put a stop to this tyrany as most people are now waking up from their trances because the tyranny is so in your face  the new world order lackeys must be nuts to think this gameplan will work in america for very long being this blatant  americans of all political persuasion will never disarm -we are not stupid  liberal or conserative we just love our freedom too damn much

4235	1	3	16	109	74	how should it be handled  is it still debatable that the attack in sabah by filipino muslim gunmen earlier this month is terrorism or not  i think all the facts confirm that it is an act of terrorism  many people in the world agree that it is obviously a terrorist attack  the kingpin of the pinoy muslims groups which attacked sabah is sultan of sulu kiram iii who is not an official of the philippines govt  either his act of sending gunmen to attack sabah is tolerated or indirectly endorsed by manila  or he should be captured by the filipino police force and extradicted to malaysia for justice  on the other hand  manila can turn over this ringleader to international police  mr  kiram iii masterminded or incited terrorist acts  and he must be held legally accountable for what happened in sabah  malaysia  that is how terrorism should be handled in order to combat terrorism  that is analogous to the capture and killing of bin laden and other al-qaeda leaders  but manila does not do anything except complaining that filipino gunmen were not treated in the proper manner down there in sabah  does it mean that manila is endorsing or sympathetic with terrorism

4690	22	35	29	262	197	senator campfield is correct  gays are the biggest bullies of all  - the six ways homosexual activists manipulate public opinion thu may 31  2012 11 23 est comments  186  tags  homosexuality may 31  2012 - anyone who is concerned about the influence of the homosexual agenda on reshaping traditional values must become intimately familiar with the major tactics that homophiles commonly employ in order to anticipate them and respond in charity and truth  homophile strategists are very adept at manipulating public opinion with an arsenal of six tactics that are based upon deceptions and half-truths  exploit the ï¿½victimï¿½ status  use the sympathetic media  confuse and neutralize the churches  slander and stereotype christians  bait and switch  hide their true nature   and intimidation  one reason these tactics have worked so well is that homophile activists have succeeded in marketing a harmless and friendly image of their movement  they have lulled people into thinking that the wider society will not be adversely affected by their radical social agenda  homosexual strategists have  in many cases  toned down their extreme rhetoric and have cloaked their agenda in soothing language  over time  however  many have begun to think of themselves and others as ï¿½homophobesï¿½ or ï¿½hatersï¿½ if they oppose any aspect of the homosexual rights agenda ï¿½ or  incredibly  even if they question it in their own minds  generals and attorneys often wish that their opponents would write a book  interestingly  leaders of the ï¿½homosexual rightsï¿½ movement did exactly that  marshall kirk and hunter madsen clearly laid out this agenda in the marching orders of the movement  after the ball  how america will conquer its fear   hatred of gays in the 90s [1] this volume is an absolute treasure chest of information for those pro-family stalwarts who are actively engaged against the homosexual rights agenda  by far the most popular homophile tactic is the claim to victim status  which is a very powerful  almost paralyzing  weapon that gives them a distinct advantage in the public square  kirk and madsen summarize the potent effectiveness of the victim status  in any campaign to win over the public  gays must be portrayed as victims in need of protection so that straights will be inclined by reflex to adopt the role of protector ï¿½ the purpose of victim imagery is to make straights feel very uncomfortable  that is  to jam with shame the self-righteous pride that would ordinarily accompany and reward their antigay belligerence  and to lay groundwork for the process of conversion by helping straights identify with gays and sympathize with their underdog status ï¿½ the public should be persuaded that gays are victims of circumstance  that they no more chose their sexual orientation than they did  say  their height  skin color  talents  or limitations ï¿½ gays should be portrayed as victims of prejudice  does this sound familiar  it does if one pays attention to any mainstream media coverage of these controversial issues as they play out in law and society  but the victim status requires a story to back it up  thus  perhaps the most common lament of the garden-variety homophile revolves around the alleged ï¿½tidal wave of anti-gayï¿½ hate crimes

4746	8	21	28	327	270	lets see what obama and the senate have to offer  it should not be difficult  just move the spending cuts from the sequestered ones to cuts that make more sense  obama can now have his ï¿½balancedï¿½ approach  in january  the gop was forced to vote for a major tax hike with zero spending cuts  now it is president obama who has been forced to accept spending cuts with no tax hike  who says divided government doesnï¿½t work  obama continues to complain of course and wants to replace some of the spending cuts with tax increases  the simpson-bowles commission  created by president bo  laid out what a ï¿½balancedï¿½ approach should entail  3 of spending cuts for every  1 dollar in tax increases and if you do the math we have nearly met that mark  only obama wants the throw that away  just a few weeks ago  as part of the fiscal-cliff deal  congress approved  620 billion in tax hikes over ten years with no spending cuts  that means that to meet the 3-to-1 ratio  we should have a corresponding  1 86 trillion in spending cuts  but the sequester cuts just  1 72 trillion in spending over 10 years  according to portmanï¿½s office  that is a ratio of just 2 78-to-1  we would need to cut an additional  138 billion  portman calculates  in order to meet the 3-to-1 ratio recommended by simpson-bowles  there is nothing wrong with cutting  1 72 trillion from the federal budget  the problem with the sequester is that the cuts were not targeted ï¿½ hitting vital programs  like national defense  and wasteful ones with equal force  for weeks  obama tried to use the indiscriminate nature of the sequester to bludgeon republicans into replacing some of the cuts with new tax revenues  but his dire warnings that criminals would be set free  teachers laid off  meat inspectors thrown off the job  air traffic controllers forced to abandon their posts backfired  it turned out most of his claims were exaggerated or flat untrue  and the false threats failed to deter republicans from holding the line and demanding that the spending cuts be enacted in their entirety  now obama is making noises like he might back down  after issuing apocalyptic warnings of the plagues and pestilence would descend upon the land if the sequester took effect  on friday he declared ï¿½this is not going to be [an] apocalypse  as some people have said ï¿½ some people  mr  president   instead of the end of the world  the sequester is now ï¿½just dumb ï¿½ tthe ï¿½dumbnessï¿½ of the sequester can easily be fixed  obama has apparently agreed to sign a continuing resolution that locks in the sequester levels of spending and gives him flexibility to choose how and where to cut  so that vital programs are not adversely impacted  what this means is that  by sticking to their guns in the sequester showdown  republicans have actually forced obama into the ï¿½balanced approachï¿½ he called for but did not actually pursue  we are now almost at the simpson-bowles 3-to-1 ratio  unfortunately  washington is not doing it in a way that promotes growth  the cuts come from discretionary programs  when it is entitlement spending that is driving our long-term debt and deficits  and the revenues come from raising tax rates on small businesses and the wealthy  rather than lowering tax rates  eliminating preferences and simplifying the tax code  still  keep in mind where obama wanted to take the country  his original demand in the fiscal cliff negotiations last year was a  1 6 trillion tax paired with a  50 billion spending increase  instead  a few months later  he got a  620 billion tax increase paired with a  1 72 trillion spending cut  from a conservative standpoint  that may be less than ideal  but for a party that controls just one half of one branch of the federal government  itï¿½s not bad

4810	3	36	23	270	203	history lesson on animal rights and tyranny ï¿½those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it ï¿½ hitlers nazi germany was marked by a preoccupation with  animal rights   hitlers third reich passed numerous animal protection laws  such as declaring that shoeing a horse was cruel  and declared an end to dissection  this reduced manï¿½s status to that of animals  and justified treating men as animals  before the war was ended  the nazis stepped up experiments on the best way to castrate a jew without anesthesia  and turned countless men  women and children into lampshades and soap  these nazi actions were justifiable by their belief that it was possible to     increase the moral standing of animals and decrease the moral standing of people  thus integrating human characteristics to animals    elevating animal life to the level of cult worship   which would lead to the spiritual and ideological changes necessary    for a new national identity   the real political objective of ï¿½animal rightsï¿½ is to eliminate  unalienable rights   and to make way for all these other supposed rights and pervert our bill of rights to the point where only the perverted are protected  a favored socialist strategy is to separate the population from common sense and its own laws by bringing about chaos  clouding real issues  then bring about ï¿½changeï¿½ through gradual ï¿½legislation from within ï¿½ ruling by planned crisis is the favored method  as this short-circuits the brainï¿½s ability to think and reason clearly about true issues  this planned chaos  such as ï¿½animal cruelty ï¿½ï¿½puppy millsï¿½ and ï¿½cock fightingï¿½  is designed to rob the nation of its creativity and life force  degrade human existence  make everything seem uncontrollable and bad  which then allows the introduction of a tyrannical form of government  the gestapo was first used by goring to do away with political opponents  a  temporary  state of emergency was declared after the reichstag fire  but was never rescinded  this allowed the gestapo to enforce conformity at every level of society  block wardens monitored their neighbors  and children were recruited to inform on their teachers and parents  the gestapo was authorized to hold people in  protective custody  which was really arbitrary arrest and imprisonment  at first  only political prisoners were taken under the guise of  preventive protective custody  and placed in ss-controlled concentration camps  later  anyone was hunted down and taken who was deemed to not fit in with ss and gestapo vision of a perfect aryan society   ss  came from schutzstaffel which means  elite guard    today we see this same conduct and set of circumstances appearing in some of our civic institutions  the only way for one man to achieve dominion and control over another is through the darkness of ignorance  letï¿½s get educated about our own laws  so that tyranny cannot gain a foothold in america  and so that we can once again have ï¿½happiness and good government flowing forthï¿½ as paraphrased by all our early education laws  we do have some beautiful laws  letï¿½s learn them  and insist that our civic institutions obey them for the good of our nation  god bless america  -compiled by  janet i  fischer and s a  martin 17954-a s  euclid ave  chino  ca 91710

4823	17	6	18	147	109	so what  one troglodite less  there is perhaps no worse political disaster for the government of cuba than the death of president hugo chï¿½vez of venezuela  after the soviet union collapsed and ceased to subsidize the castro regime  the government of cuba went through a very difficult period  that is  until president chï¿½vez picked up the tab  while the real amount of the subsidy is unknown  venezuela does send more than 115 000 barrelsof oil a day to the refinery at cienfuegos and pays for tens of thousands of cuban doctors and sports trainers who are deployed all over latin america  the true amount is probably significantly north of five billion dollars a year  if there was anybody that could expect the very best cuban medicine had to offer  it was the castros five billion dollar man  this makes the upcoming death of chï¿½vez that much more embarrassing for the castros  because the velocity at which the strongman has deteriorated is due in no small part to the incompetence of the cuban doctors at cimeq - the hospital of choice for the communist party leaders  according to dr  jose marquina  who has become well known for having the only information on the venezuelan presidents condition that has proved over time to be accurate  the cuban doctors are at least partially at fault for the venezuelan leaders imminent demise  he has said that the cubans misdiagnosed the cancer  treating chï¿½vez with chemotherapy and other treatments designed for the wrong type of cancer  this made the disease resistant and impossible to treat  while causing other complications which affected not only chï¿½vezs life expectancy but also the quality of what life remained  lol

4911	2	28	27	331	243	washington -- the federal governments official watchdog had a message for congress on thursday  hey  stupid  the climate is changing  the government accountability office delivered that warning in its update of the greatest threats the government faces in carrying out federal programs  generally the gao identifies things like flaws in the defense contracting process and fraud in health care programs  this years update of the high-risk series report included the increasingly obvious and growing external threat of climate change -- in spite of the continued insistence from many members of congress that fears over global warming are overblown   limiting the federal governments fiscal exposure to climate change is one of the new areas we have on the list   comptroller general gene dodaro  the head of the gao  told reporters at a capitol hill press conference   the federal government is terribly exposed to this change   he added  noting that the government owns hundreds of thousands of buildings  operates defense installations  picks up the tab to help local governments with disasters  and runs crop and flood insurance programs   the government doesnt budget for disaster   dodaro said   and the record number of disasters hit above 90 in 2012   dodaro was aware that some in congress might not like his agencys embrace of climate change  but he argued that the facts justified it   we believe that the information coming from the national academy of sciences and from the federal governments own global change research program     has been very clear on the science underpinning this area   dodaro said  he did allow that the gao was staying away from the debate on why the climate is changing   we are not focusing on whats causing these changes  we know that there are efforts under way to deal with emission issues  so thats a policy matter for the congress   he said   we think theres enough scientific evidence to show  regardless of whether anything else changes  theres enough problems identified   still  while president barack obama has proposed making a stronger push to deal with climate change  and leaders in the senate have praised him for it  the idea has received a chilly reception from leaders in the house  rep  darrell issa  r-calif    the chairman of the house government reform and oversight committee  joined dodaro at the press conference to emphasize that it doesnt matter whether lawmakers agree on climate change  the effects are nonetheless occurring  and congress should plan   were recognizing that we have under-appropriated and under-prepared for a wide variety of disasters   issa said   if theyre occurring more  not less  if were seeing an absence of indexing for inflation  those are all areas that legitimately put it at high risk   issa added  even while indicating he has some skepticism on the climate front   i hope all members of congress on both sides of the issue recognize that its really not about where you are on climate change  how much co2 is being emitted -- which  by the way  has gone down  not up -- its really about recognizing that congress has not adjusted for the amount of money we are paying out   issa said  the cost issue was one of the prime factors dodaro cited in deciding to take the potential political risk of officially elevating the threat   we also believe the timing is right because of the federal governments fiscal position   dodaro said   we can no longer afford to take on these huge costs that occur as a result of disasters  and we need to prepare properly  we think we have a sound case   rep  elijah cummings  md    the top democrat on the oversight committee  had the starkest warning for his colleagues   this landmark action by the nonpartisan experts at gao     is a wake-up call for congress to finally start addressing this issue   cummings said thursday
